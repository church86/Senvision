Computers by Stephen Shankland February 14, 2017 5:00 AM PST @stshank Enlarge Image Apple's Touch Bar-equipped 15-inch MacBook Pro debuted in 2016. Stephen Shankland/CNET It took six weeks of tech support calls, power usage monitoring and Genius Bar diagnostics, but I'm finally convinced my new MacBook Pro isn't an expensive mistake. And what I've learned along the way can help you, too -- regardless of what laptop you're using. I bought a 15-inch Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro sight unseen late last year, confident that performance improvements, Apple's superior trackpads and better portability would justify the upgrade from its 2012-era predecessor. But my pleasure at the speed-up evaporated when I noticed within the first week how fast the machine drained its battery. My heart sank when the revamped Mac design lasted only 3 hours, 7 minutes on battery in my first formal test just doing routine work -- chores in Google's Chrome browser, chiefly, but also a few minutes on power-hungry photo editing. This was not supposed to be what happened when one of the biggest reasons I upgraded was to replace the feeble, worn-out battery in the old machine. I feared my Apple was a lemon. It wasn't just me, though, as evidenced by forum fretting and some cases of customer returns. But with help from Apple techies and a lot of testing, I reached a different conclusion: The MacBook's terrific new screen, which maxes out at a significantly brighter level, was gobbling watts despite a more energy-efficient design. There are other factors, but dialing down the brightness helped me once again work all day on a single charge. For full details, check CNET's tips on how to get your MacBook Pro battery to last all day. Overall, I'm satisfied. Still, the experience made it clear that even top tech companies like Apple, Google and Adobe Systems still have lots of work to do delivering products that minimize power consumption. And it's disappointing how often power-saving techniques mean micromanaging your machine or doing without useful features. A decade after the iPhone launch, it's time to assume your customers will be unplugged from the power socket more often than not. Hopes dashed Apple boasts of battery life "up to 10 hours" on two tests -- "wireless web" and "iTunes movie playback." When my Mac fell far short, I started investigating. Apple's Activity Monitor utility initially showed disappointing battery-life scores. Screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET I was not encouraged by posts like the explanation from developer Jeff Geerling on why he returned his MacBook Pro or the dozens of pages of commentary on Apple's support site. I spoke to others, too. Duarte Cunha Rosa, a lawyer in Portugal, was distressed when his new 13-inch MacBook Pro wouldn't last more than 5 hours, and Apple tech support couldn't help. "When asked if I wanted to return it, I did," he said, pulling his 6-year-old Mac back into service. "I'm seriously blanking on what my next move is." I ran daily tests for weeks to try to understand what was happening. They weren't the most rigorous, since my daily work habits fluctuate, but most days I use the same thing: one or two dozen browser tabs for Google Docs, Gmail, Google Calendar, Twitter, Facebook, blog posts and other information sources; Slack for work chitchat; and Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop for short bursts of photo editing. Apple's Safari browser fared a little better than Chrome, which did better than Brave, which did better than Firefox, but none did well. I edit lots of photos outside work, which is why I bought such an expensive machine in the first place, but Lightroom lasted only three hours on the battery. Things were bad enough that I started carrying a Microsoft Surface Book when I knew I'd be working out of the office. It's slower at photo editing than the Mac, but it lasted all day on battery. The MacOS 10.12.3 update that fixed Consumer Reports' complaint didn't help. But Apple did. My initial interactions with Apple, including hours on the phone with tech support and two trips to stores to get my hardware evaluated, yielded only comic relief: One Apple-authorized repair store asked if I had a USB-C dongle so it could run a test, and Apple's own Genius Bar had to hook two dongles together to connect my Mac to their network cable. Eventually, though, we got to the heart of the problem. Hopes restored Screen brightness turned out to be the biggest factor in getting my battery back -- much more than I'd expected. The new 2016 MacBook Pro screen is 67 percent brighter than its predecessor's, and I'd been running it bright. Sure enough, dialing it down made a world of difference. I get 10 hours most days at a brightness setting of 8 to 10 out of 16. When using Safari and an uncomfortably dim setting of 5 or 6, I got 12 hours. The 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar lets you dim the laptop's screen to save power. James Martin/CNET Screen dimming isn't a new idea. But it may make more of a difference here. Although the new MacBook Pro's screen is 30 percent more efficient, it can run brighter, and the new model has a smaller 76 watt-hour battery, compared with 99.5 watt-hours on the 2015 model and 95 watt-hours for my 2012 predecessor. I learned more from Apple -- like avoiding USB devices when possible. For me, the guilty parties were my Ethernet dongle, memory card reader and external hard drives -- even though the drives had their own power supplies. The problem is that any of these devices wake up the parts of the computer's communication system that otherwise snooze in a low-power state. Stick with Wi-Fi when you can. Also on the list is the keyboard backlight -- dim it or shut it off -- and dongles with built-in chips, for example to convert video signals to HDMI. They might not consume much, but it all adds up. After all, the glowing Apple logo on earlier Mac laptop lids didn't consume much power either, but efficiency is one one reason Apple scrapped it. Also, when possible, avoid software that uses the separate but more power-hungry high-performance graphics chip that's now standard in 15-inch MacBook Pros. Adobe's Lightroom, Photoshop and Acrobat each demand this high-performance GPU (I monitored with the handy gfxCardStatus utility) even when they're idling in the background, and non-Safari browsers are more likely to fire it up. Some sites, like Google Maps, keep it on and leave it on, while others only flip it on for a few seconds. So close browser tabs and software you're not using. Apple doesn't let Safari use the high-performance GPU, a battery-saving restriction. That can cause problems with graphics-intense sites -- a rougher time moving around in Google Maps' 3D view, for example, or slower frame rates on the ShaderToy site. But it's easy to see why Apple made the decision it did. Chrome is working to deliver the best of both worlds, with updates to be gentler on the GPU, for example by using the lower-power GPU more often and switching tabs to it when they're in the background. Reducing power usage is a "top priority for Chrome in 2017," said Chrome product manager Rachel Popkin. "We have a bunch of people working on it." And Adobe expects improvements that will optimize how its software uses graphics chips to improve battery life on Macs, the company said. That's great news. For me, the improvements can't come soon enough. Because I may be happier than a month ago, but I'm still not leaving my laptop charger at home. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?

 $667 million startup Crowdstrike just lost an ugly public spat with a company that tests software Julie Bort Feb. 14, 2017, 6:29 PM 4,307 facebook linkedin twitter email print Crowdstrike founder CEO George Kurtz Crowdstrike For many years a company called NSS Labs¬†has tested a wide range of enterprise software products in order to help IT professionals decide which products¬†perform best. In those years it's developed a¬†reputation as one of the most hated independent testing companies around. And it just had a pretty ugly public spat with security software vendor CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike tried, and failed, to get a temporary restraining order and injunction to stop NSS Labs from publishing results of a test that includes CrowdStrike's software and several competitors. CrowdStrike makes cloud security software that protects PCs and networks from hackers and malware. It gained attention as a buzzy startup when it raised $156 million in venture funding, including a huge $100 million round in 2015 from Capital G, the growth investment fund from Google's parent company Alphabet. That round valued the startup at about $667 million, according to Pitchbook. NSS came to fame years ago for its tests on browser security which found Internet Explorer¬†to be more secure than Google Chrome. Google was not pleased,¬†disputed the methodology, accused¬†the tests of being¬†paid for by Microsoft (which NSS denied) and said that the tests didn't even use the latest version of Chrome. CrowdStrike said in a blog post that it initially hired NSS to test its software and issue a private report to be seen only by the peeps at CrowdStrike. It said it disputed¬†NSS's testing methodology (calling it "deeply flawed"). When NSS wanted to include CrowdStrike in one of the¬†tests it would sell in a¬†public report, and announce the results at a major conference, CrowdStrike said no. NSS was not deterred, and according to CrowdStrike's blog post, obtained software provided by one of¬†CrowdStrike's resellers and did the tests anyway. CrowdStrike was not pleased. "It¬†colluded with a reseller and engaged in a sham transaction to access our software," the company¬†accused. The company asked a judge to block the release of the report alleging everything from breach of contract to stolen trade secrets. The judge in Delaware district court wasn't buying those allegations, and on Monday issued a ruling siding with NSS. So the results will be¬†published. Neither CrowdStrike or NSS immediately responded to requests for comment. Previous challenges This is not the first time NSS has raised the ire of the software vendors it tests. In addition to the Microsoft/Google browser hullabaloo, NSS was criticized by Palo Alto Networks and FireEye in 2014, when they questioned its testing methodology and its ethics. Palo Alto Networks founder and CTO Nir Zuk went so far as to imply¬†NSS charged the vendors who are tested a lot of money and gave them undue influence in how the tests were set up so that their products would shine, while products from their peers (the ones who didn't pay) would not. Zuk later apologized and formally retracted his accusations¬†and then praised the company, "My statements are untrue and I feel that the nature of their testing is indeed unbiased and invaluable to both us and our customers. My company, Palo Alto Networks, is working with NSS Labs and we have found them to be completely transparent and honest." Meanwhile¬†NSS has consistently denied those sorts of allegations, saying that it doesn't take money from vendors for tests shares publicly. It says it chooses which vendors to test based on requests from IT professionals wanting to buy its reports, and if a vendor refuses to participate,¬†it will buy¬†the¬†product and test it that way. The upshot is, if you are an independent software tester and you are doing it right, you are going to anger a lot of vendors who will try to¬†discredit your results. And if you are an independent software tester who is doing it wrong, you are going to anger a lot of vendors¬†who will try to discredit your results. But since the judge ruled against¬†CrowdStrike, IT buyers will be free to see the latest test results, examine the methodology and judge for themselves.

AFP LOS ANGELES, United States ‚Äî YouTube‚Äôs most watched blogger PewDiePie will lose his preferred status on the Google-owned video service after posting several videos containing anti-Semitic remarks and Nazi references, the tech firm said Tuesday. YouTube said it was canceling a popular program from the 27-year-old Swede, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, the same day Disney said it was cutting its ties with the social media star. PewDiePie ‚Äî known for posting humorous clips to his more than 53 million followers on YouTube ‚Äî will be sanctioned for violating the platform‚Äôs guidelines on hate speech, Google said Tuesday. ADVERTISEMENT READ:¬†PewDiePie gets time-out from Twitter ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided to cancel the release of ‚ÄòScare PewDiePie Season 2‚Ä≤ and we‚Äôre removing the PewDiePie channel from Google Preferred,‚Äù a statement from the US tech giant said. ‚ÄúScare PewDiePie‚Äù was program that YouTube ordered for its online subscription service. Google Preferred is a program that allows advertisers to direct their messages to the key 18- to 34-year-old demographic, with an implicit guarantee that the participation won‚Äôt hurt their brand. The moves won‚Äôt keep PewDiePie off YouTube but will likely limit his audience and could sharply curtail his revenue from advertising. Separately Disney indicated it was ending its business relationship with the Swedish media star. ‚ÄúAlthough Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate,‚Äù according to a statement to AFP by Disney‚Äôs Maker Studios. PewDiePie, who had editorial independence under the terms of the arrangement with Disney, reportedly paid two Indian men five dollars to hold the banner reading ‚ÄúDeath to all Jews‚Äù while they laugh and dance in the January 11 video. READ:¬†Disney drops YouTuber PewDiePie over anti-Semitic videos ‚ÄúI was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online,‚Äù Kjellberg said in a Tumblr blog post on February 12. ‚ÄúI picked something that seemed absurd to me ‚Äî that people on Fiverr would say anything for 5 dollars,‚Äù referring to a website that helps freelancers receive part-time work. The Wall Street Journal reported PewDiePie had posted nine videos that display anti-Semitic jokes and Nazi references since August. One of them shows a man dressed as Jesus Christ, saying ‚ÄúHitler did absolutely nothing wrong.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes,‚Äù the YouTube star said in the blog post. Kjellberg is a top earner on YouTube, making roughly $14.5 million (13.6 million euros) last year, according to reported estimates from social media data firm NeoReach. That amount includes splitting ad revenue with YouTube, as well as sponsorships and appearance fees. In December, PewDiePie accused YouTube of trying to ‚Äúkill‚Äù his channel and has threatened to shut it down, a move that turned out to be a publicity stunt.¬†CBB play_circle_filled New wave of robots set to deliver the goods February 05, 2017 play_circle_filled Nintendo reboots with new Switch game console January 15, 2017 play_circle_filled Avatar-style South Korean manned robot takes first baby steps January 04, 2017 play_circle_filled 'Heart-in-a-box' device helps save lives January 04, 2017 TAGS: Anti-semitism, Blogger, Felix Kjellberg, Google, hate speech, Nazi, PewDiePie, Racism, Social Media, technology, Youtube For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

(AN photo by Lulwa Shalhoub) RIYADH: Using the Internet smartly and safely is the aim of the digital literacy initiative ‚ÄúKulluna Online‚Äù (We‚Äôre All Online) launched by the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Foundation (MiSK) and Google on Tuesday. Starting this semester, around 10,000 boys and girls at 50 schools in Riyadh will attend interactive workshops by Google-trained facilitators, as part of the multiyear program that will later expand to include other parts of Saudi Arabia.¬† ‚ÄúGiven the notable growth of usage of the digital world, whether through regular browsing or instant messaging applications, it was necessary that we find a creative initiative to spread awareness on digital safety,‚Äù said Badr Al-Asaker, MiSk secretary-general. ‚ÄúKulluna Online was the product of MiSK‚Äôs belief that the Internet has become one of the most important languages of our time and a necessary tool for development. The program aims to spread digital awareness and to keep up with the latest global practices, which ensures safe Internet browsing.‚Äù The day started at Riyadh schools with an interactive, chatty session between young onstage presenters and the audience, mainly students from elementary and intermediate grades. Saudi Arabia has 21 million Internet users out of a population of some 32 million, Education Minister Ahmed Al-Issa said in his keynote speech.¬† Speaking at a press conference, Mohamed Al-Harthi, deputy minister of education for curricula and educational programs, said: ‚ÄúExecuting this program comes in terms of activating Saudi Vision 2030 and enhancing the partnership between the public and non-profit sectors.‚Äù The idea of the program started by gathering feedback from school students, their parents and teachers via focus groups delivered by MiSK, and listening to their concerns over their children‚Äôs digital usage and presence. The workshops will teach students to think carefully before posting something online, and how to protect their privacy by not sharing passwords or oversharing personal photos. It will also teach them how to avoid being victims of phishing, spam and identity theft, as well as how to have a positive attitude online. Sam Blatteis, Google head of government relations and public policy for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), believes education lies at the heart of realizing Google‚Äôs mission: To organize the world‚Äôs information and make it universally accessible and useful. ‚ÄúWhat this project is doing is helping in one way to contribute to the foundation, setting the stage for developing a longer-term confidence and interest in the Internet economy,‚Äù he told Arab News. ‚ÄúParents have done a great job teaching children how to protect themselves offline by telling them not to talk to strangers or not to take candy from them. But there‚Äôs a growing need now for youth to have the same skills online. Think before you post. You are what you share.‚Äù Delivering the program will adopt a gamification technique to transform online safety education into memorable and fun content that children can embrace. Google will gather post-mortem feedback in the form of qualitative and quantitative data from students, teachers and trainers to get an idea of the change in perceptions before and after the program. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of programs on online safety in terms of dos and don‚Äôts, and they were often referred to in the context of cybersecurity,‚Äù Blatteis said. ‚ÄúWe thought there‚Äôs an untapped potential to popularize it and socialize this program through calling it ‚Äòdigital literacy,‚Äô to bring to life how this (program) is something that can be uplifting and give kids confidence when they surf online. ‚ÄúThat was a finding that we at Google found through our studies over the past couple of years in the GCC.‚Äù When asked about the possibility of hosting students to do internships at Google, he said: ‚ÄúWe want to focus on delivering this program. I think there are inspiring kids here, and we‚Äôre making efforts in localizing the content. ‚ÄúWe tried to make it ‚ÄòGoogley‚Äô and give it a glimpse of some of Google‚Äôs culture, but long-term an aspiration I have is to help develop youth to‚Ä¶ one day apply for internships at places like Google.‚Äù Google has structured similar programs that were applied at schools in the US and UK.

Do you agree with his explanation? Do you disagree? Let us know in the comments. Bio: Mr Morrow was appointed as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and a Director of nbn effective 2 April 2014. He joined nbn with a remit to ensure all homes, businesses and communities across Australia can access fast broadband as soon as possible, at affordable prices and at least cost. Prior to his present role Mr Morrow served as CEO of Vodafone Australia. On NBN's blog ‚Äî Gigabit Broadband: The Facts There has been a lot of discussion in recent days around the need for Gigabit broadband in Australia ‚Äì let‚Äôs set some things straight‚Ä¶ The nbn‚Ñ¢ network is here to bring fast broadband to all of Australia by 2020 ‚Äì more than 4 million premises already have access to fast broadband via the nbn‚Ñ¢ network today. In just a few months we will be at the halfway point of the rollout. Next year we will be three quarters built. By 2020 we will be complete. What once seemed impossible is now a reality. I was asked last week by the media about the need for Gigabit (Gbps) speeds in Australia. These are lines that are 40 times faster than plans based on our most popular 25Mbps wholesale service. "In our opinion, there is still minimal consumer demand for ultra-fast speeds..." The fact is nbn‚Ñ¢ already offers a wholesale 1Gbps product to retail service providers ‚Äì which RSPs can make available to more than 1.5 million homes, and has been on sale for around four years. Currently, there are no retail 1Gbps speed plans on offer from the retailers. This is, in our opinion, because there is still minimal consumer demand for these ultra-fast speeds ‚Äì especially at the prices retailers would have to charge for them. Our own data shows that 83 per cent of people on services powered by the nbn‚Ñ¢ network today are ordering retail services based on the two lowest wholesale speed tiers 25/5Mbps and 12/1Mbps. NBN Says It Is 'On Schedule, On Budget, And Approaching Half Way Point' NBN's half yearly results are out, detailing the six months leading up to 31 December 2016. Here's what NBN says about how it is going. Feel free to comment with your personal experiences. Read more There is currently around a $20-$30 monthly difference between what retailers charge for plans based on our 25/5Mbps wholesale service and our 100/40Mbps wholesale service ‚Äì but only 13 percent of end-users are willing to pay that relatively small premium for access to that faster tier. We have to be realistic about what the market is actually telling us about demand for ultra-fast services. Of course, the demand for Gigabit speeds could, and probably will, change ‚Äì current plans for FTTP and DOCSIS 3.1 HFC suggest they will be able to deliver such speeds to around 5 million premises on the nbn‚Ñ¢ network by 2020 and the other parts of our network, with the exception of satellite, have upgrade paths to offer the same ultra-fast speeds when demand comes around. Rather than build for a demand that may materialise in ten years, we are constructing a national network capable of continuous upgrading to meet market needs as and when they arise. There is little point in adding to the already high $49 billion cost of the nbn‚Ñ¢ network to provide a capability that end users do not yet require and RSPs are not selling. Gigabit demand We spend a lot of time researching overseas markets about Gigabit speeds, and the trends are not what you might think. We have met with global operators offering 1Gbps services and they willingly concede that their end-users are simply not using speeds anywhere near 1Gbps ‚Äì in fact they would be lucky to actually ever use a fraction of that speed ‚Äì so, at present, the Gigabit game is really about marketing, not actual utility. Giz Explains: Every NBN Technology, Compared Feeling a little bit confused by the stupidly complicated and ever-changing rollout of the National Broadband Network? Here's our quick guide to the different types of NBN that might be installed at your home. Read more Even in a heavy usage household right now it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôd struggle to generate the need for anything close to a 1Gbps ‚Äìif you had five 4K TVs streaming 4K movies simultaneously then that‚Äôs only around 100Mbps being consumed ‚Äì leaving 900Mbps idle. Given that the vast majority of current online video viewing is in SD or HD ‚Äì requiring only 2Mbps-5Mbps then a 1Gbps pipe would be enough to stream 200 HD streams simultaneously ‚Äì way, way beyond the requirements of a normal household. Cost is the key Of course, if we were in a position to deliver 1Gbps for $49/month, as they do in Singapore, then we would do it ‚Äì but we are simply not in that position from an economic point of view. The fact is that Singapore is a city state, comprising of high density apartment buildings ‚Äì and Australia is over 10,000 times larger than Singapore. The Singaporean Next Generation National Broadband Network [NGNBN] cost only a fraction of what it will cost to build the nbn‚Ñ¢ network. "If we were in a position to deliver 1Gbps for $49/month, as they do in Singapore, then we would do it..." The nbn‚Ñ¢ network is costing around $49 billion to build ‚Äì and we need to recoup that cost ‚Äìgiven that our business model is split between driving revenues from access and consumption charges, we simply cannot match the kind of 1Gbps pricing on offer in markets like Singapore and Hong Kong. In Hong Kong you can deliver FTTP for as low as $150 per premises ‚Äì in comparison, thanks to Australia‚Äôs unique geographical and population density situation, it is costing us an average of $4,400 to connect every FTTP premises and can cost significantly beyond that in many situations ‚Äì these are the stone cold facts of the matter and there is no getting away from them. Many roads to gigabit speeds If you want evidence that we are taking the right approach, you need only look at what is happening in the US with Google Fiber. Last October, the internet giant announced that it would be putting its much publicised FTTP deployment on hold and would look at new ways to deliver ultra-fast broadband. Google Fiber found that viable economics for Gigabit broadband simply did not exist once the initial hype of the project had faded and the product hit the streets. Indeed, respected writer Farhad Majoo pointed this out in an article published through Slate in 2013. [Google Fiber] felt a little underwhelming. After all, who needs to play five HD videos at the same time? If that‚Äôs Google‚Äôs best demo of its superfast service, what does it suggest about what regular people will do with it? What‚Äôs more, the demo didn‚Äôt even begin to approach the limits of Google Fiber ‚Äî with five HD videos playing simultaneously there were still hundreds of megabits left on the pipe. When I got back home a few days later, I replicated the same test on my home broadband line and experienced only a few hiccups. Ultimately even a company with a huge amount of capital available such as Google Fiber found that digging up driveways and gardens to connect every single premise to FTTP was too expensive and time consuming. Google ultimately concluded that they could not make it work commercially offering Gigabit FTTP broadband at just $70/month. "Google Fiber found that viable economics for Gigabit broadband simply did not exist once the initial hype of the project had faded..." We are still waiting to see what Google Fiber will do next ‚Äì reports suggest that it will move towards a Fixed-Wireless solution ‚Äì but quite clearly their conclusion was that the economics of delivering gigabit speeds via FTTP simply did not add up. That‚Äôs not to say that Google Fiber didn‚Äôt have an impact in the market ‚Äì their presence forced the incumbents to raise their game with the likes of AT&T now marketing FTTP access to 4 million premises across 46 metros, but this still represents only 3 per cent of the near 130 million premises in the US ‚Äì we are talking about a niche market. Markets like Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan started their deployment of high-speed broadband in the late 1990s and having fully recouped their investments in delivering FTTB with VDSL ‚Äì typically offering up to 100Mbps ‚Äì are now delivering 1Gbps and even 10Gbps via FTTP. This Is How Much The NBN Spends To Hook Up Your House In its latest half-year financial presentation on Thursday, the NBN revealed the cost of connecting each home to FTTP, FTTN and other technologies in its catalogue. Read more For a variety of reasons, our broadband upgrade in Australia started much later, so we cannot judge ourselves against markets like these; they are much further along on their journey and you just can‚Äôt compare Australia to Singapore or Hong Kong for obvious reasons including those stated above. This is why operators around the world are so excited about technologies like DOCSIS 3.1 and G.fast, which allow Gigabit broadband to be deployed at substantially lower price points and in far less time than it takes to deploy Gigabit services over FTTP ‚Äì and we will see both of these technologies emerge much more fully in the next few years globally as well as here in Australia. In conclusion We know that people in Australia want access to fast internet ‚Äì that is precisely what we are aiming to deliver with the nbn‚Ñ¢ network. We also know that 1Gbps speeds are simply way beyond what even the most advanced end-user needs today, let alone what is needed by regular families across Australia. There is literally not a single mass market consumer application ‚Äì or even a combination of applications ‚Äì that requires 1Gbps capability right now. This will change in the future, especially as augmented reality, artificial intelligence, 8K technology and virtual reality penetrate our daily lives. In fact, we hope that by delivering a fully connected continent we can help create a market for Gigabit applications ‚Äì and when Australians need those kinds of speeds we will have the solutions in place to provide it. Bill Morrow is CEO of nbn. NBN After-Hours Installation Service Coming Soon, Will Cost $150 Per Customer Telcos always wants to install new fixed-line services, including those on the National Broadband Network (NBN), during working hours; the most inconvenient time for a lot of people. They usually require someone at the installation premises and some people have to take time off work just to wait for a technician to come over. But it looks like there will soon be an after-hours installation service for the NBN - for a price. Read more Comments ¬´ 1 2 ¬ª Cameron @moonhead Feb 15, 2017, 10:28am Ctl+F "CVC", nope, no mention of the real issue here. The fact nbn (tm) is absolutely reaming ISP for the CVC pricing, which makes any upgraded speeds beyond current ADSL offerings completely uneconomical. Interesting the capital cost for installation is mentioned here, as an excuse not to provide higher speed services. The capital cost for a 1Gbs service is the same as that of a 12Mbs service, with the current FttP technology used. There is a higher operation cost, of course, but no mention of that. It's bizarre the justifications here, contradictory at every turn. Complaining about higher capital costs, yet only building short term network needs, why don't you build a network that will last 30-40 years, instead of one that will last 3, then you won't need to recoup the capital cost over such a short space? Hell, even the eventual sale of the company will be much better, if it's set up to provide a suitable service for 40 years, instead of one that's already obsolete. Of course we don't get any of that here, nbn (tm) has lost it's way. Bending over to political whims, instead of delivering infrastructure for the future of this nation. If Bill Morrow had one iota of guts, he'd stand up against the political bullshit and deliver what we really need here. Reply 9 cameron @cameron Feb 15, 2017, 12:33pm Are you sure about that? RSPs will always claim their supplier costs are too high to disclaim away any undesired subscriber activity or pricing. It happened (still happens) now with Telstra's wholesale (copper) product pricing being blamed as 'too expensive' by all the resellers... Why would they come out and say ... 'oh yeah - our own internal costs are too high which is why '. It's a convenient way to direct attention away from the excessive cost inefficiencies incurred but RSPs call centers, poor processes and the cost of marketing. If you really want to bring up driving cost control within NBN, focus on their contract labour supplier overhead costs instead and not get hung up on technology access types. Reply -2 Cameron @moonhead Feb 15, 2017, 12:59pm There's enough competition in the market to show that there is serious constraint on what ISPs can resell from nbn at certain prices. Reply 1 devmac @devmac Feb 15, 2017, 4:00pm "not get hung up on technology access types" When did they get hung up on technology access types? Please don't use the term "technology agnostic" if you reply. Last edited February 15, 2017 4:03 pm Reply 0 SgtBatten Guest Feb 15, 2017, 6:10pm CVC currently costs RSPs over $15 per Mbps per month. A real 100Mbit uncontested connection is $1500 before hardware costs and overheads. Reply 0 grunt @grunt Feb 16, 2017, 10:18am My understanding is that the first 150 Mbps is either free or heavily subsidised, which is part of the problem. Its cheap to service a 200 Mbps capacity pipe across the 32 properties, its not cheap to service 2 Gbps capacity (if they were to offer 1 Gbps), or even 400 Mbps if they decided to offer a 200/80 service. Thats one of the main dramas as I understand it anyway - the cost of servicing the higher capacity cant be easily offset to enough users. To use your $15, that means around $28k/month in RSP costs, needing to be recouped before they even start on their own internal costs and turn a profit. A cost they pass on to the consumer and what residence would be happy paying $1000/month for internet? It will need addressing in the very near future if NBN is ever serious about the slightest chance of 1 Gbps. So yes, its the RSP's that are holding off from offering the option, but its NBN costs that are causing them to hold off. Its simply not viable costwise to either them or the consumer. Reply 0 deevee @deevee Feb 16, 2017, 4:20pm Nice try Morrow, what you actually meant to say is there is no residential demand for a $300/mo internet connection. Make gigabit $30/mo and see the demand then! Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita Feb 15, 2017, 10:36am because there is still minimal consumer demand for these ultra-fast speeds ‚Äì especially at the prices retailers would have to charge for them. That is the problem right there, you make something too expensive and then say 'people don't want it'. 1Gbps speeds are simply way beyond what even the most advanced end-user needs today, let alone what is needed by regular families across Australia. Any family with multiple, multiple hundreds of gigabytes of photos and videos and music that would like to backup to cloud services would welcome decent upload speed. Gigabit speeds are as much about being able to use cloud services as backups and transfers as anything else. This old argument that lots of people can watch netflix and game at the same time without needing gigabit is wearing thin. People aren't using gigabit as it is too expensive, if they did have it, the usage would increase heavily as things become possible that are not feasible on slower connections. Last edited February 15, 2017 10:38 am Reply 2 sherbert86 @sherbert86 Feb 15, 2017, 4:29pm But hang on, a 100/40 connection at full steam can upload about 432GB a day by extremely rough maths. These things dont need to be uploaded instantaneously, they can trickle. Not to mention that this upload wouldnt affect the other people in the house watching netflix, as that is download speed. We have 100/40 at home and even with 4k streaming services on all the time, a few game and movie downloads a month we are struggling to crack 500GB. Honestly I dont think I'd notice much if we reduced our speed to 25mbps. 99.9% of household users are going to get almost zero benefit out of 1gbps. Business users, thats another story, but fast connections are available for $$$. Reply 0 data-cain @data-cain Feb 15, 2017, 7:55pm Honestly I dont think I'd notice much if we reduced our speed to 25mbps. and you'd get 5Mbps upload, yay! 25Mbps aint terrible, but with multiple users it's fairly 'meh' I had 35Mbps Cable with 2 users, and we'd both notice it at times. But, our upload was 1Mbps too... Currently I'm on 50Mbps (ish) down, 3.5Mbps up. Generally don't notice anything with 3 of us streaming videos, etc. even while downloading. It's fairly aids for cloud storage though. :( Ping sucks dong too. Still, you know, don't build for the future or anything, coz you only need 64KB! k streaming services on all the time, a few game and movie downloads a month we are struggling to crack 500GB I think 500GB is enough for most house holds these days, as long as certain content (ie netflix/youtube) is either unmetered, or used reasonably. For a while we had a third guy use our cable connection (35Mbps), and alone he managed to smash around 75% of our 500GB cap in 10 days, only using Netflix (only at 1080p too) - to be fair, he's an extreme case. Reply 0 #R @ashr Feb 16, 2017, 10:14am yeah I agree with the comments here, the download speeds aren't the problem. I'm on 100Mbps cable and it's fine for gaming, downloads etc BUT I'm on a max of 2.4Mbps upload so I can't use cloud services very well, I can't stream to twitch or youtube gaming so that as an option for a potential part time job is out of the question until the upload speeds are improved. For the record my area is set to be acquired by the NBN late 2018 where they'll just buy the Telstra cable, so I'll be on the same service for the foreseeable future :( Reply 0 Bradie Tilley Guest Feb 16, 2017, 11:41am A lot of people would love 1Gbps and feel the difference too. I am part of the statistics that "opt" for 25Mbps/5Mbps...Except I'm not opting for it that's all I can get. As for most of the population in WA so it seems. Like just give me 1Gbps FTTP for Christ's sake. Reply 0 sherbert86 @sherbert86 Feb 16, 2017, 11:53am I don't personally use my upload bandwidth much so not really an issue, could still use RDP and grab files when necessary on ADSL2 with 1mbps upload. Don't forget most cloud services unless they're paid will never actually let you get near your rated bandwidth, Dropbox etc will give you 5-10mbps upload if you're lucky. Probs more if you pay monthly fees I guess. Reply 0 Sgt Moo Guest Feb 15, 2017, 10:38am What a god damn crackpot. There's no uptake on 1Gb NBN because the only areas that would have access to it (FTTP) dont need it and the areas that would use it/need it have FTTN so the service isnt capable of it. But seeing as this moron used to work for vodafone he probably doesnt know his elbow from his arse anyway. Had some moron NBN spokes person come speak to all the businesses on the commercial strip where I work tooting on about how NBN is going to change how we run our businesses in the coming year. Our rollout isnt scheduled till at least 2018 and is going to be WAY to slow for our needs by then. It'll change our business alright, we are going to be forced to move to remain competitive! Trying to run a computer repair shop on a flakey 4-5Mbit connection is hard enough as it is. Reply 1 md @md Feb 16, 2017, 11:43am so 25Mb/s will somehow be worse than the current 4Mb/s.... pisstake.

So we start more than a decade later, and then offer the speeds they were offering last century? Reply 0 0kensai0 @0kensai0 Feb 15, 2017, 10:46am You can't ever compare Australia to Hong Kong or Singapore. You can, however, compare Sydney Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide to Hong Kong and Singapore. And it would be much more justified to place the country into 2 or even 3 tiers of broadband infrastructure. 1Gigabit for FTTP for major cities and a mixed technology package for the smaller cities and outback... Reply -1 CaptSiD @mrsid Feb 15, 2017, 11:05am As someone who lives outside the major areas but has business dealings that require a fast internet I think your idea is a bad one. The further we move away from this antiquated idea that cities are the repositories of the elite and elite services the better. Reply 2 ross_co @ross_co Feb 15, 2017, 12:41pm I agree, this kind of thinking only drives up cost's of living in inner cities and makes the outer suburbs/regional areas less desirable. Reply 3 tonyintsv @tonyintsv Feb 15, 2017, 3:38pm Anyone on FTTP, FTTN, or Fixed wireless is already paying to launch those 2 satellites. Reply 0 0kensai0 @0kensai0 Feb 15, 2017, 2:51pm It's less the antiquated idea that cities are the repositories of the elite and that elite services the better, it's more that it's cheaper to service a higher density. An FTTB line in HK supplies close to a thousand people compared to maybe 50-100 in Australia... you could of course bite the bullet and leverage the fact that we have double the tax rate of Hong Kong to pay for services in the country (which I'm actually all for) but apparently Canberra doesn't like to do that... Reply 0 devmac @devmac Feb 15, 2017, 3:53pm That turns into an argument between capitalism and socialism. Capitalist: Regional citizens pay hundreds more to access the infrastructure because that's how much it costs to service them. Socialist: The "city elite" pay above the odds for access to the infrastructure to spread the cost of servicing the regional areas at level prices. I lean towards to Socialist reasoning in this case, as the prices that regional people would pay under "the market / capitalist" ideology would pretty much price them out of the market which, I think, would have significantly detrimental effects on regional areas - a lot of them are dying quickly enough as it is without cutting off their Internet access as well.

When I drive (around the city) I generally can't go faster than 40Kmh so that would be an argument for restricting cars to 40Kmh??? Reply 1 md @md Feb 16, 2017, 11:52am Actually a lower speedlimit in the city can/(may-in some cases) result in shorter transit time, less congestion etc provided the speed enforced is reasonably close to the "resonant" speed of the system (we needs(sic) autonomous cars because humans are to emotional and stupid for their own good), old adage: "less haste more speed". possibly analogous to data transfer. poorly matched waveguides can wreak havoc. Reply 0 bushrat011899 @bushrat011899 Feb 15, 2017, 11:08am This is quite a circular argument, we don't need fast Internet because the Internet we're used to is built for a slow connection. Look at the 4K streaming example. A 4K video stream only needs 20Mbps, with extreme compression. A "true" Ultra HD Blu Ray puts out at up to 128Mbps. Video games now come in sizes around 50GB a piece, wouldn't it be great to live stream the files for a game instead of downloading it first? Wouldn't it be great to have the cars be the limit of speed, not the road? Reply 0 devmac @devmac Feb 15, 2017, 3:43pm It's the same every time someone wants to hide what's really going on. "If you build it, they will come" vs. "If you don't build it, there's no demand, so why build it?" A place I worked always ran out of a particular product. This was never fixed because they would look at their monthly reports and see that X were purchased during the month, so they make sure that X can be purchased for the forthcoming months. Missing the fact that there was demand for X+Y. Context. If the context is missing, someone's lying to you. Reply 0 soletaken @soletaken Feb 15, 2017, 11:28am I will be moving to Switzerland shortly, which I may add is horrendously expensive to live.

Unlimited downloads etc. Plus I can add a mobile plan for another CHF 29 a month. Yes Switzerland is a tiny country with high density living, but Australia should not use that as an excuse not to deliver a future proof product that will ultimately pay itself off. Focus on the main cities which have a large population and where the majority of people live. Once that is up and running and a steady revenue is in place focus on providing the best connections possible for the outlining country towns etc. Reply 0 vlad @vlad Feb 15, 2017, 11:54am Thanks to all Gods of Internet, I have 40-70 Mbps on HFC, and it is radically different to mediocre 10 Mbps of last 10 years.

We used to have one speed, with different charges for download limits, while America had unlimited downloads, and paid for different speeds. Thats what everyone here wanted. Fast forward to today, and its the reverse. We have unlimited downloads, and different speeds, while the US has largely moved to a download charge, and now people want to move back to that. If we had just the one tech, it works, but in a world of different technologies though, I cant see it working. Not easily anyway. We already have 5 technologies (plus mobile broadband and legacy stuff all the way back to dialup) and another probably on the way. Need to unwind all of that, which aint gonna happen. Reply 0 barry @barry Feb 15, 2017, 12:27pm He does have a point and many will scream at me for this but having a 1Gigabit connection, doesn't mean the person paying for it will ever use a full Gigabit of download. They may use 25 or 50 of it at one time. Unless you are torrent everything, which would be great in all honesty. Of course there is no mention of NBN or ISPs having to continuly supply the speed you pay for. I remember reading some where that they only need to do that once a day so if you pay for 25Mbits download, then you could have 10Mbits and once a day for an hour you might have 25Mbits. That's painful and if that's true and I remember correctly, if you pay for 1Gigabit connection you might only get 25 and once a day get 1Gigabit. With places like apartment buildings they have one pipe that might be a gigabit and that might be shared between 50 connections in the building so if you pay for a Gigabit connection and everyone in that building is on the internet, you wouldn't get the speed you pay for anyway Reply 0 grunt @grunt Feb 15, 2017, 12:37pm I was going to say similar. Thing is, at every point we've gotten improved technology, you can argue the very same thing. There was no need for the speeds of ADSL2, ADSL, 256k cable, or even 56k dialup back in the day. In every situation, social, business, or entertainment needs came in to fill the capacity provided to the point theres no way you would rewind to an earlier tier now. Build it, and reasons to use it will arise. Not necessarily over night, but before you realise it, it'll be needed, and by that point it'll be too late. I remember when I got ADSL2 at my place, broadly 10 years ago (had it elsewhere, this was a place I bought), and had one product use that connection. The 6 Mbps I was able to get was enough. Several years later, I realised I had a half dozen items all connecting at the same time. Today its around a dozen. Day to day usage has grown, and my capacity was no longer enough. Thankfully I have FttP now so it is, but it was indicative of how usage grew to fill (and then some) capacity.

Hahahahahahaha don‚Äôt make me laugh. I get 7-10Mbps down on my NBN FTTN connection. It‚Äôs actually slower than my ADSL2 connection, somehow. Maybe nobody is paying for more than 25Mbps down because they can‚Äôt get even that, let alone more. I am getting pretty fed up with this fact not being reported. NBN can‚Äôt even meet its promise of providing 20th century internet, despite spending at least A$46b. And they want to talk about gigabit? Bill Morrow is a joke and should resign immediately. Reply 4 superbird @hotfootdarth Feb 15, 2017, 1:14pm It seems like Bill Morrow is conveniently ignoring users like yourself. I wonder how many other people are having such low speeds with FTTN. Last edited February 15, 2017 1:17 pm Reply 0 hotcakes @hotcakes Feb 15, 2017, 1:26pm Currently, there are no retail 1Gbps speed plans on offer from the retailers. This is, in our opinion, because there is still minimal consumer demand for these ultra-fast speeds ‚Äì especially at the prices retailers would have to charge for them. No kidding, because just the CVC to provide 1Gbps for even 25% of the time would cost ISPs $4000 a month. There is currently around a $20-$30 monthly difference between what retailers charge for plans based on our 25/5Mbps wholesale service and our 100/40Mbps wholesale service ‚Äì but only 13 percent of end-users are willing to pay that relatively small premium for access to that faster tier. That‚Äôs because a whole lot of people on FTTN physically can‚Äôt reach 100/40, even if congestion was a non-issue. Why would they pay for something they can‚Äôt get? In Hong Kong you can deliver FTTP for as low as $150 per premises ‚Äì in comparison, thanks to Australia‚Äôs unique geographical and population density situation, it is costing us an average of $4,400 to connect every FTTP premises and can cost significantly beyond that in many situations ‚Äì these are the stone cold facts of the matter and there is no getting away from them. That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre lumping both opex and capex into the $4400 CPP for FTTP ‚Äì and conveniently leaving opex out of the calculation for FTTN, where it‚Äôs by far the single greatest expense ‚Äì because you‚Äôre paying Telstra to put in new copper and then renting it back off them. This is why operators around the world are so excited about technologies like DOCSIS 3.1 and G.fast, which allow Gigabit broadband to be deployed at substantially lower price points and in far less time than it takes to deploy Gigabit services over FTTP ‚Äì and we will see both of these technologies emerge much more fully in the next few years globally as well as here in Australia. Gee, it sure is a good thing that nbn co aren‚Äôt even deploying their FTTdp with G.fast ‚Äì which has never been tested outside of 3m copper in a lab anyway.

Reply 0 steegs8319 @steegs8319 Feb 15, 2017, 2:02pm Does he not realise the impact that $30 every month could make to a larger family who could use that extra speed for multiple users? The pure & simple reason that the majority of users are on 12 or 25Mbps plans is because they can barely justify the price gouging that occurs already, let alone adding another $30 to it! Reply 0 Almost Guest Feb 16, 2017, 3:53pm Before the NBN didn't larger families have a landline, ADSL2, and a number of mobile phones. Surely getting an NBN plan that costs $30 more would be offset by the "free" calls you would now make to those phones for which you used to pay for? Reply 0 welbot @welbot Feb 15, 2017, 3:54pm Our own data shows that 83 per cent of people on services powered by the nbn‚Ñ¢ network today are ordering retail services based on the two lowest wholesale speed tiers 25/5Mbps and 12/1Mbps. Yeah... you reckon that might have anything to do with the fact that most flyers I've received in the mail, and ads I've seen everywhere, don't actually advertise the speed? They just say "$59/month for unlimited data on NBN". It's not til you actually go to the ISP's website that you realize it's only 12 or 25. Most mum and dad customers would just call up and say "sign me up" without asking any questions about speed etc, cos I'd bet most of them don't even know that there's different tiers. i currently have my ADSL2 with TPG and pay $49 a month. I got a message from them once NBN was available in my street, saying I could get unlimited data for $59 a month. Upon investigation (which required actually going part way through the signup process to find) I discovered it's only 12mpbs. Like what?! You want me to pay $10 more a month for slower internet?! Get farked! I get 14mpbs on my ADSL! i have actually signed up for the switch though, but for a much better plan of unlimited data on a 100/40 connection for $59/mth. I'd say the 83% of people they refer to just don't have a clue. "It's NBN, it MUST be faster!" Reply 1 nutcola @nutcola Feb 15, 2017, 5:04pm Here are some uses of fast (up to gigabit) connections: -Someone wants to send you a 2GB video they just took from their 4K drone - cool I got it in seconds. -Uploading all your photos, videos and music to a cloud service, and keeping your data synced. -Downloading that same data to a new machine -Daily backups to the cloud - eg full HDD image of a business critical machine, or your gaming rig, or whatever! -Storing all your files in the cloud - you wouldn't need a 4TB NAS anymore if you could upload and download all your data to the cloud at the same speed as on your LAN. You wouldn't even need a 500GB SSD in your new PC since you can just get it off dropbox or icloud or google drive or whatever almost instantly. -Small business VPN links between sites - instantly share data as if it were on your LAN, rather than waiting for 10 minutes for the autocad file you want to copy across.. -Download new games (several GB?) in seconds or minutes, eg on Steam -Send your mum your latest holiday photos & videos in seconds -Download that 300MB HP printer driver in three seconds rather than 10 minutes -Download the new Win10 update (several GB), in less than a minute -Drive investment and business opportunities in regional and rural areas - some businesses only need fast internet and they can do business from anywhere -Anything you can think of, or haven't thought of yet!! FFS get over this 'most people don't need fast internet to stream video' garbage...

I hate reading that statement with so much passion. It's a cop out of epic proportion. I was on the 100/40 plan when I signed up, and I cant even get 12/1Mbps actual speed, so I changed plans after having 5 tech call outs who told me it's as good as its going to get because I am located more than 1050m from the pillar and the copper to my house is terrible and my line wont give a stable reading on their diagnostic tools. I got told to give up on 'fast' internet by the NBN. I have begged and pleaded for help, all I want is fast internet, I was so excited when I heard I was getting NBN, and then it was delayed 5 times over the next year. Finally I get it and its no better than ADSL was, upload is marginally better, download is consistently worse. Biggest letdown in recent history. But you read your data as I don't want better speed because I am connected to a low plan, and 83% of us are all saying the same thing so why bother with faster speeds? You sir, are an idiot. Maybe we are all stuck with inferior fttn technology and can't get anything faster so why pay extra for it? You should release a report on customer sync speeds. Let us all know how you are actually doing instead of twisting stats to blame us for your mistakes.

Like private health insurance, I'm probably subsidising a babyboomer parasite's lifestyle choices and an FTTP connection.

In December, Felix Kjellberg threatened to take his star power off YouTube. Turns out, it was a ruse. The Swede behind the PewDiePie character admitted in a video that he was trying to boost his YouTube fan numbers to more than 50 million. Irreverence like this has turned him into the biggest celebrity on YouTube and helped the Google site become the world‚Äôs largest online video service. Until, late on Monday, it became a liability. Google said it was removing PewDiePie‚Äôs channel from its premium advertising service and canceling his YouTube series after he published videos with anti-Semitic messages. The controversy is a setback for YouTube‚Äôs strategy of promoting premium content that attracts top advertising rates, and its newer attempt to get viewers to pay for original TV shows and movies. Kjellberg‚Äôs series "Scare PewDiePie" was one of the shows on this subscription service, known as YouTube Red. YouTube‚Äôs programming strategy is devoted to the young, aspiring filmmakers, video bloggers and sketch comedians that first used the site. Unlike Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which have spent billions of dollars on programming from professionals already working in the Hollywood system, YouTube has funded original shows from PewDiePie, Joey Graceffa and Rhett & Link. These stars help YouTube stand out from the crowd, but are harder to control. They built large followings speaking their minds without the filter of a producer or the restraints of a traditional media company. Dropped by Maker The antics of YouTube stars are subject to greater scrutiny since large media companies gobbled up many of YouTube‚Äôs biggest channels. PewDiePie‚Äôs freewheeling style didn‚Äôt sit well at Walt Disney Co., whose Maker Studios cut ties with Kjellberg earlier on Monday in response to the videos. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Disney‚Äôs move. YouTube determined that some of Kjellberg‚Äôs videos, which included one where he paid for two men to unfurl a sign reading "Death to All Jews," violated its standards for advertiser-friendly content. However, YouTube decided that the videos didn‚Äôt cross its threshold for hate speech, which specifies that content must be intended to incite violence. So the company dropped Kjellberg from Google Preferred, its white-glove service for brand-safe ads, and canceled the second season of his show for YouTube Red. It didn‚Äôt remove Kjellberg‚Äôs videos from its site, nor restrict him from the regular system that drives most YouTube ads. A YouTube spokeswoman declined to comment further on the decision. ‚ÄòOne Creator‚Äô For Google, the public rebuke of YouTube‚Äôs biggest star won‚Äôt materially affect advertising sales. YouTube sells most of its ad in bulk, not around particular channels. And PewDiePie, though popular, accounts for a tiny fraction of overall viewership on a video site where thousands of channels have millions of subscribers. "It‚Äôs one creator," said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC. "YouTube is far, far stronger than any one creator." Still, the move may put other YouTube creators on notice.¬† While removing the offending videos from premium ad deals was warranted, YouTube may risk pushing away creators if its standards look too stringent, said Jill Sherman, senior vice president at advertising agency DigitasLBi. "The second it feels policed or overly mandated, it starts to feel like prime-time television," she said. "And that‚Äôs exactly what YouTube doesn‚Äôt want." Google doesn‚Äôt disclose YouTube revenue, but has said repeatedly that it is, along with mobile ads, a primary driver of growth. During the fourth quarter, Ruth Porat, Chief Financial Officer of Google parent Alphabet Inc., said YouTube was seeing "tremendous growth."¬† She wouldn‚Äôt share how many paid subscribers YouTube Red has. "We‚Äôre pleased with the early success," Porat said. "It‚Äôs still early days. It takes a while to build a subscription business here." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In fact, the payouts were so substantial, that two people familiar with situation called it ‚ÄúF-you money,‚Äù¬†according to Bloomberg. Such an incentive and pay-based infrastructure was originally configured to reward success and retain talent¬†within the company, but it ultimately had a reverse effect, leading to an exodus of talent. Google was trying to keep up in the ‚Äúarms race‚Äù for ‚Äúdriverless‚Äù vehicle development as several companies, both in the tech and automotive industry, were seeking out the best minds in the business.

One potentially huge advantage that hard-headed, logical AI has over our squishy, fallible human methods of getting things done is that emotions don't get in the way. AI has no nose to cut off in order to spite its face, which means in theory things should be a lot more efficient. ¬† But what if there were two AIs competing for the common good? Would they work together to achieve their shared aim, or try to outshine the other in a bid for glory? That's what Google's latest DeepMind experiments sought to find out, and intriguingly it left the AI looking far more human than you might have expected. Google pitted two versions of DeepMind ‚Äì red and blue ‚Äì against each other in a couple of computer games to see how they would deal with each other. In the first, they had to collect apples that appeared on screen, but with the added twist that each AI had a laser that could temporarily disable its opposite number if it chose to use it. Video of Gathering gameplay The result from thousands of run throughs? Surprisingly human. When digital apples were in abundance, the AIs would generally cooperate peacefully, collecting the apples as they went along. As soon as apples became scarce, however, the weapons came into force. Sound familiar? Oh, and larger, more intelligent neural networks tended to shoot their opponent no matter how many apples there were around. Read into that what you will, although Google doesn't necessarily think this means selfish is smart. It might just be that because shooting requires more ‚Äúskill‚Äù, the dumber AI didn't want to distract from the task of apple hunting unless absolutely necessary. The second game was one that favoured cooperation: ‚ÄúWolfpack‚Äù. In this game, the two AIs were charged with catching a tricksy blue dot moving around a map. Anyone who has been blue dot hunting themselves will know that it's far easier to put one in your hunting lodge trophy cabinet if you cooperate to corner it. If you chase the blue dot on your own, things get far more ‚ÄúBenny Hill.‚Äù Video of Wolfpack gameplay In this instance, smaller ‚Äúdumber‚Äù networks would often go solo, but the larger smarter networks quickly established that working together achieved better results. Though of course, with only one blue dot per game, resource scarcity is not at play here. So artificial intelligence can be cooperative or competitive depending on the context. How disappointingly human. You can read more about the experiment on the DeepMind blog, and in the research paper.

Cloud Spanner is launching in public beta today with the promise of bringing both¬†consistency and scaling to¬†mission-critical applications‚Ä¶ At the moment, developers building cloud applications have to make some conscious trade-offs. Traditional SQL databases are known for their stability, while NoSQL¬†solutions scale better and are more efficient at data-processing but at the expense of consistency. Facing the same problems, Google set out in 2007 to build a database that combined the best aspects of both without the downsides. Since publishing a paper in 2012 , Spanner has been used to run several¬†large Google services, like the Play Store and AdWords. With Cloud Spanner, Google hopes to offer both consistency and scalability¬†in a single, fully managed service to third-parties. Primary advantages over existing solutions include: Focus on your application logic instead of spending valuable time managing hardware and software Scale out your RDBMS solutions without complex sharding or clustering Gain horizontal scaling without migration from relational to NoSQL databases Maintain high availability and protect against disaster without needing to engineer a complex replication and failover infrastructure Gain integrated security with data-layer encryption, identity and access management and audit logging Offered alongside existing¬†Google Cloud Platform services, Cloud Spanner scales based on usage with a simple ‚Äúpay for what you use‚Äù pricing model.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS South Korean antitrust investigation looks to determine if Google doomed Samsung‚Äôs Tizen¬†platform Evan Blass@evleaks February 14, 2017 2:17 PM Tags: Android, antitrust, Google, Samsung, Tizen, top-stories Google is facing antitrust scrutiny yet again, with South Korea‚Äôs Fair Trade Commission (FTC) announcing that it‚Äôs investigating the U.S. search giant to determine if it obstructed mobile partner Samsung‚Äôs development of its homegrown smartphone platform, Tizen. As reported by the English version of the Korea Times, investigators are focusing on an Anti-Fragmentation Agreement between the two companies in which Samsung agreed not to fork Android in developing its own operating system. (Other companies, like Amazon and Xiaomi, use forked Android builds, based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP)¬†to power their devices.) Because of the agreement, which ensured that Samsung would not leverage its market dominance in Android smartphones to deprive Google of the revenue it generates from its licensed, commercial version of the platform, the Korean company was forced to develop Tizen as an OS incompatible with the plentiful Android app catalog. Furthermore, the FTC said that it was revisiting another antitrust investigation into Google, this one stemming from the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement it also entered with Samsung. MADA stipulates that commercial Android licensees give prominent on-device positioning to Google‚Äôs own services, and a 2013 investigation looked into whether it was harming other domestic search providers, such as Naver and Daum. While Google was cleared at the time because officials determined competitors‚Äô market shares were not being significantly affected, changing market dynamics have apparently convinced regulators to take a fresh look at the situation. Google has faced antitrust scrutiny in nearly all of the major markets in which it operates, including the U.S., Europe, and Russia. While the company has so far escaped penalties in its home country, both Russia and the European Union have found it in violation of antitrust protections.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Google and Disney Sever Ties With YouTube Star PewDiePie Over Anti-Semitic Videos Google and Disney Sever Ties With YouTube Star PewDiePie Over Anti-Semitic Videos Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Brow Beat Slate's Culture Blog Feb. 14 2017 4:55 PM Google and Disney Sever Ties With YouTube Star PewDiePie Over Anti-Semitic Videos By Marissa Martinelli ¬† Felix Kjellberg's channel has more than 50 million subscribers. Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images Felix Kjellberg, the Swedish YouTube star better known by his alias, PewDiePie, has lost contracts with Google and Disney after a Wall Street Journal report pointed out anti-Semitic language and imagery in his videos. Kjellberg‚Äôs channel, which features a mix of humor, opinion, and gaming videos, has the most subscribers on YouTube with more than 53 million. Disney-owned Maker Studios was the first to sever ties, according to the Journal, apparently in response to the publication's inquiries. A spokesperson told Variety: ‚ÄúAlthough Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate. Maker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward.‚Äù Advertisement Google-owned YouTube followed suit, cancelling the second season of Kjellberg‚Äôs reality show, Scare PewDiePie (which is produced by The Walking Dead‚Äôs Robert Kirkman) and removing him from Google Preferred, an aggregate program that connects advertisers with YouTube‚Äôs most popular channels. Google had previously removed ads from some of the videos. The Wall Street Journal flagged nine videos, three of which have reportedly since been pulled from the site, as having anti-Semitic or Nazi-related comments and imagery. One of the videos in question, which has not yet been taken down, is a prank video in which Kjellberg pays two men to hold up a sign that reads ‚ÄúDeath to All Jews‚Äù via the freelance website Fiverr. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think they would actually do it,‚Äù Kjellberg says in the video, after the men display the sign and begin dancing. Kjellberg responded to the controversy in a Tumblr post. ‚ÄúI make videos for my audience. I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAs laughable as it is to believe that I might actually endorse these people, to anyone unsure on my standpoint regarding hate-based groups: No, I don‚Äôt support these people in any way.‚Äù Marissa¬†Martinelli is a Slate¬†editorial assistant. ¬† Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up FOLLOW SLATE Twitter Facebook Instagram SLATE ON IPHONE ANDROID KINDLE Reprints Advertise with us ABOUT US CONTACT US WORK WITH US USER AGREEMENT PRIVACY POLICY FAQ FEEDBACK CORRECTIONS Slate Group Panoply Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

By Jack Wallen | February 14, 2017, 12:57 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen Google's new Pixel phone comes with a number of bells and whistles that you cannot find in other iterations of Android. One such feature is Google Assistant, an intelligent personal assistant that allows you to use a very powerful AI to engage in sort of Google Now powered two-way conversations. If you don't own one of the coveted Pixel phones, you can gain some semblance of Google Assistant by way of Google Allo. Unlike the official Assistant app, Google Allo is a smart messaging app that has a bit of Google Assistant baked in. With Google Allo's Assistant, you can get some features that are available on the Pixel phone. Let's look at what you can and cannot do with the Allo iteration of Google Assistant. SEE: Amid security concerns, Google's Allo virtual assistant is still worth a look (TechRepublic) What you can do with Google Assistant through Google Allo Deeper searching One of the more useful things you can do with Allo's Google Assistant is have a conversation about a topic. Say, for instance, you want to know the capital of Zimbabwe. Ask Google Assistant, and it will answer, "Harare." Want to know what the weather is like in Harare? Simply ask Google Assistant "and what is the weather there?" (Figure A). Follow-up questions is one of the areas in which Allo's Google Assistant shines‚Äîso much so that you'll find yourself leaning on the pared-down version of Assistant before you opt for a standard Google search. It's that good. Figure A Allo's Google Assistant shines at answering your questions. Add calendar appointments Another incredibly handy feature in Allo's Google Assistant is the ability to add calendar appointments via conversational mode. Open Allo, tap Google Assistant, tap the microphone button, and say "Add a calendar event for tomorrow." Google Assistant will ask for specifics about the appointment, and then it will add the event to your calendar (Figure B). Figure B Adding a calendar appointment with Allo's Google Assistant is quite easy. Search your history in Google Assistant If you've already run a search or received any information from Google Assistant in a conversation, you can quickly recall that information by running a search. When you're in the Google Assistant chat, tap the menu button on the upper right corner and then tap Search. In the Search field, type what you're looking for, and Allo's Google Assistant will reveal all of the related results (Figure C). Figure C Searching your Allo's Google Assistant history. Read bar codes and recognize landmarks While in Allo's Google Assistant conversation, tap the + button and then snap a photo of a bar code. Once the photo is taken, tap the Send button to send the photo to Assistant. In return, Google Assistant will provide information about the product associated with that bar code, such as a purchase link and ratings (Figure D). Figure D Allo's Assistant can assist even with just an image. Assistant can also recognize landmarks, products, and logos. Snap a photo, send it to Google Assistant, and you'll get information about that photo. Access your photos on Google Drive If you use Google Photos, Allo's Assistant can present you with your photos. Tap the mic button and say "my photos from yesterday," and Allo's Google Assistant will show all of the photos you uploaded to Google Drive yesterday, or whatever date you specify (Figure E). Figure E Allo's Google Assistant showing off photos from Google Drive. The "my day" command Although originally not part of Allo's Google Assistant, the "my day" command has managed to cross the divide between the official Google Assistant and Allo. From within Allo's Google Assistant, speak the command "my day," and Assistant will list all of the appointments scheduled for the next several days that are in your Google Calendar. SEE: Google Allo: Don't use it, says Edward Snowden (ZDNet) What Allo's Google Assistant cannot do You may be wondering, "So what can the official Google Assistant do that Allo's Assistant cannot?" I'm glad you asked. Here's the short list of what you cannot do with Allo's Google Assistant; it's interesting to note that, a few months ago, this list was significantly longer. There are more tricks up Google Assistant's sleeve (regardless of how you access it), but this list will get you up and running. Access Google Assistant from any screen More about Mobility Super Bowl 51 makes digital history with record-breaking data usage Mobile phone use expected to top 5.5 billion devices by 2021 Personal digital assistants: The current lineup Subscribe to our Mobile Enterprise newsletter With the non-Pixel version of Google Assistant, you can only access the app from within Allo; on a Google Pixel phone, you can access Assistant in the same way as you can access Google Now on a regular Android device‚Äîfrom any screen, the "Okay Google" command will call up Assistant. That's a pretty convenient feature. Launch apps On Allo's Google Assistant, you can say "Open Facebook," and Assistant will present you with an app launcher that you must tap to launch. With the Pixel iteration, you can simply say "Open Facebook," and the app will launch. This convenience goes a long way to bringing true hands-free operation to life. Take photos The Pixel version of Google Assistant allows you to take truly hands-free photos. Just say "take a photo" or "take a selfie," and Assistant will take a photo using either the front-facing camera (for photo) or the rear-facing camera (for selfie). No more having to use a camera timer. Add to Google Keep If you use Google Keep for things like shopping lists, Google Assistant can add to them. Say "add to shopping list," and Google Assistant will ask what to add. Sadly, Allo's Google Assistant cannot handle lists. The future of Android Google Assistant is the future of the Android platform. My guess is Google will eventually roll out the full-blown app baked into Android so you won't have to purchase a Pixel to enjoy the complete feature set.

Google‚Äôs new cloud service is a unique take on a database Google Cloud Spanner provides users with a highly available database running on Google's infrastructure Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) on 15 February, 2017 04:00 0 - - - - print email IDG Google has turned a database service that it uses to run some of its mission-critical products into an offering for its public cloud customers. On Tuesday, the company launched Cloud Spanner, a new, fully managed database that‚Äôs supposed to provide the transactional consistency of a traditional database plus the scalability and performance of a NoSQL database. It‚Äôs based on the same systems that run the company‚Äôs own Spanner database internally. Usually, businesses have to pick either a traditional or a NoSQL database, and each comes with particular trade-offs. Traditional databases provide better transactional consistency, but can be hard to scale. NoSQL databases are better at scaling but sacrifice consistency. Cloud Spanner is designed to reduce those trade-offs, and it's also delivered as a fully managed service. Among other things, that means Google will manage hardware, software and replication of content for a database that can span multiple data centers. The service will be useful for companies that need millisecond-level consistency in their databases worldwide, according to Nick Heudecker, a research director at Gartner. In an interview, he called out financial services and advertising as two industries that might benefit from Cloud Spanner. Heudecker did point out that the service will require companies to port existing applications, which may prove challenging. Google is working with partners to help customers move over, according to Deepti Srivastava, the product manager for Cloud Spanner. Cloud Spanner has generated more interest than most new Google services, based on response to a closed alpha test, Srivastava said. Cloud Spanner grew out of a project that began in 2007, when a team of Google employees set out to solve the problem of choosing between NoSQL and traditional databases. That led to a paper, published in 2012, describing the company‚Äôs Spanner database, which uses a number of novel techniques, including atomic and GPS clocks inside data centers to maintain time consistency. Spanner is used to operate Google services like AdWords and Google Play. According to the company, it can handle tens of millions of queries per second. That pedigree is a feature of Cloud Spanner that appealed to Peter Bakkum, the platform lead at Quizlet. The education software company, which offers a popular set of study tools for students, is evaluating how to scale its database infrastructure. Quizlet has been testing Cloud Spanner since the closed alpha phase and may end up using the service to replace its existing setup of MySQL databases. Refactoring Quizlet‚Äôs applications to use Cloud Spanner will require work, but that's true of all the possible upgrade paths, Bakkum said. ‚ÄúWe need a fundamentally different architecture to do scaling, and any of those solutions have a difficult migration path,‚Äù he said. Cloud Spanner‚Äôs popularity may be throttled somewhat by Google‚Äôs position in the cloud market. While the company has been aggressive in releasing new capabilities and improving its services to attract new customers, its use still lags behind that of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Using Cloud Spanner means bringing data to Google‚Äôs cloud platform and building an application that targets it. While some companies are comfortable working with multiple cloud providers, not all of them are. That said, Gartner's Heudecker said Google is the only major cloud provider offering a product like this one and it will be hard for rivals to catch up. ‚ÄúCloud Spanner is not just software,‚Äù Heudecker said. ‚ÄúIt is the union of software, hardware ‚Äî in the form of atomic clocks in Google‚Äôs data centers ‚Äî and an incredibly robust network connecting their data centers together. So it‚Äôs not just writing code. It‚Äôs a lot of investment and a lot of operational expertise that Google excels at.‚Äù Right now, Cloud Spanner instances can only exist in one of Google's cloud regions, though they'll be replicated across multiple availability zones inside those regions. In the future, Cloud Spanner customers will be able to have one database that's kept in sync across multiple regions.

Don't know what that is? Neither did we, but it's SUPER addictive on your desktop computer, smartphone, or tablet. By James Wright / Published 14th February 2017 GOOGLE/GETTY Google has unveiled a Valentine's Day themed mini game To celebrate Valentines Day, Google has released a brand new Google Doodle themed around the day of love. This latest Google Doodle takes over the US search engine's homepage in countries around the world, including Canada, United States, Argentina, Australia, France, UK and more. It's an incredibly addictive interactive game which lets players control a pangolin (it's a little mammel, a bit like an Anteater), racing around a series of maze's collecting items. There are four levels in total; but truth be told it's so addictive we bet you play some levels over and over again. Each lasting three minutes and available to play on desktop and laptop computers, players have to use the arrow keys to navigate the little fella and use the Space Bar to make the pangolin jump. If you want to play on your mobile, like say the iPhone 7 or Google Pixel, you will be given two virtual arrow keys on screen, as well as a dedicated jump button.

"Pangolins are the most trafficked mammal in the world, and all 8 species face a significant threat from poachers and smugglers," Google posted on its blog. "Check out the World Wildlife Fund to learn more about the the pangolin‚Äôs plight and to support WWF‚Äôs efforts to save the pangolin and other endangered species." Google also includes a link so that players can choose to donate and help the plight of the helpless endangered pangolins.

Name: Subject: Message: How to use Android Instant Apps Apps & Games Features How To Newsby Jimmy Westenberg2 days ago 14 1441 29 At Google I/O 2016, we got our first look at a wonderful new feature coming to Android called Instant Apps. Basically, Instant Apps allow you to access a cloud-based version of the app on your Android phone without requiring you to install it from the Play Store. This will not only save users time and effort, but they‚Äôll also allow companies¬†to¬†let people demo what‚Äôs essentially a full version of their app before installing it. If you‚Äôve been waiting since last May to try this feature out for yourself, we have some good news. Google is finally rolling out Instant Apps, but only to a select number of users at the moment.¬†I have the feature working on my Nexus 6P running Android 7.1.1, and numerous other reports state that the Pixel and Pixel XL, running Android 7.1.2, are also gaining support for Instant Apps. But now that Instant Apps are rolling out to a number of additional users, let‚Äôs talk about how to use them. To find out if your Android device has access to Instant Apps, follow the instructions below. To get the process started, you‚Äôll first need to enable Instant Apps on your Android device. This is as easy as turning on a switch in your phone‚Äôs settings menu. How to enable Android Instant Apps Navigate to your phone‚Äôs Settings menu. Scroll down and tap¬†Google under the¬†Personal category. Under the¬†Services category, select¬†Instant Apps. Tap the toggle on the top-right of the screen. Read through the instructions card (and Play Terms of Service, if you really want to), then tap¬†Yes, I‚Äôm in. Great! You‚Äôre halfway there! Once you‚Äôve completed the steps listed above, you‚Äôre now ready to search for and use Instant Apps. More applications will be added to the Instant Apps lineup in the future, but as of right now, the list of supported apps is pretty short: Wish, Viki, Buzzfeed and Periscope. We‚Äôve only been able to make Wish work with Instant Apps so far. Since this appears to be a server-side rollout, you may be able to access the other three applications in the near future. Below you‚Äôll find instructions on how to find and use Instant Apps. How to use Android Instant Apps On your Android device, perform a Google search¬†for one of the supported applications listed above. Scroll down and select the app listing that includes the word¬†Instant (as shown below). Tap¬†Open app. Once the Instant App loads up, you can use it just like you would with any other app that‚Äôs been downloaded via the Google Play Store. In Wish‚Äôs case, you can access your account, browse through products, and even order things without installing the app to your phone. If you do want to download the Wish app, however, that process is pretty easy from here. Pull down your notification shade, then tap¬†App info. From here you can install the app, clear the app‚Äôs data, and even see which permissions it‚Äôs been granted. Tapping the¬†Install button will bring up a new card, allowing you to install the app right from that screen. If you‚Äôd rather view the Google Play Store listing, just tap the overflow menu button (three vertical dots), then tap¬†View on Google Play. Overall, the process seems to be pretty seamless, at least once the Instant Apps toggle is enabled on your phone. And remember, Instant Apps are still slowly rolling out to users, so you might need to wait a little longer to use the feature. There‚Äôs no doubt that Instant Apps will be a huge hit in the future; they have so much potential right now, especially for shopping applications like Wish. Have you been able to use Android Instant Apps on your device yet? If so, we‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below!

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 February 2017 by Military News Mobile Optimization Increases in Importance in 2017 Switch Lead provides mobile SEO services to help websites boost Google rankings PHILADELPHIA, PA ‚Äì FEBRUARY 14, 2017 ‚Äì Your business will likely lose out on customers if its website isn‚Äôt optimized for mobile devices. The Switch Lead search engine optimization firm provides mobile SEO services to help you break that trend. Google rolled out its mobile-friendly algorithm over the past two years, boosting the ranking of mobile-friendly websites. It reportedly works both ways. Having a website optimized for mobile devices can boost your Google rankings, while not having a mobile-optimized website can lower rankings. Google recognizes that it isn‚Äôt enough to have websites optimized for desktop users. The search engine giant provides a website that tests whether web pages are mobile-friendly. Why should business owners care whether their websites are mobile-friendly? The desktop version of a website may be difficult to view and use on a mobile device. Users must pinch or zoom into the site so that they can read the content. This can cause mobile device users to be frustrated and search elsewhere for the information they need. Strategies designed to brand companies and increase online marketing should definitely include how to reach mobile-device users. A Pew Research Center survey shows that 95 percent of Americans now own a cellphone, including 77 percent who own a smartphone. That‚Äôs up from 35 percent when Pew conducted its first survey of smartphone ownership in 2011.¬† More people are searching on-the-go. They are also searching the web more for services and products available in their community. The days of potential customers grabbing their phone books are over. They now search online to find companies in their community. That changes what keyword phrases they use to find answers. Boosting local search engine results takes knowing what people are typing in to find products and services in their city. Mobile SEO experts like Switch Lead give business owners an edge when it comes to local search engine optimization. Switch Lead starts with a full website SEO audit to determine what improvements a website needs. It analyzes every aspect of a website including: ‚Ä¢ Site architecture ‚Ä¢ URL slugs ‚Ä¢ Content ‚Ä¢ Navigation systems ‚Ä¢ Linkings to internal pages ‚Ä¢ Backlinks that link from other sites to your web pages The search engine optimization firm focuses on creating high-quality content to boost the authority of a company‚Äôs website. It diversifies content to help increase traffic and engagement. Switch Lead‚Äôs SEO strategy includes using location keywords related to a business‚Äôs location. Customers often include the name of their city in their search queries. Switch Lead prepares for this. The higher a business ranks in Google, the more likely a customer will pay attention. Switch Lead helps companies make the changes needed to increase their Google search engine ranking.

Zeman ¬† @phonescooper Unlocked smartphones let you use your device on the carrier of your choice, whether at home or travelling overseas. Though unlocked phones tend to be pricey, you can't really put a price on the freedom they offer. Here are our picks for the five best flagship-class unlocked phones available right now. AD ¬† ¬† ¬† article continues below... Background The phones sold at carrier stores are by-and-large locked to the carrier that sells them. There are exceptions, but for the most part an AT&T-branded phone will only work on AT&T's network and so on. The benefit of buying a carrier device is that you can spread out the cost over 12-24 months, making that $700 price tag more palatable. At the same time, device financing ties you to that carrier until the device is paid off. That stinks. This is why unlocked phones are so appealing. Removing the financial obligation to your carrier allows you to insert any SIM card in an unlocked phone for service. Have a T-Mobile account at home, but want to use Vodafone in the U.K.? Go for it! The downside? You almost always have to pay full price for an unlocked handset. When you're looking at high-end smartphones, that means shelling out a lot of green all at once. Where do unlocked phones work? Most include GSM (2G), HSPA (3.5G), and LTE (4G) radios, while a few also include CDMA (Sprint/Verizon 3G) radios. The vast majority of unlocked handsets will operate well on AT&T and its Cricket Wireless prepaid service, as well as T-Mobile and its MetroPCS prepaid service, not to mention a good selection of carriers overseas. Unlocked support for Sprint and Verizon is more limited, but not entirely out of the question if you know what to look for. It all depends on which LTE bands are supported inside the phone. 1. Google Pixel / Pixel XL Google's Pixel phones offer a lot to like. The hardware is perhaps a little ho-hum compared to the eye-pleasing designs pushed out by Samsung, but the Pixel and Pixel XL are still well-made (by HTC, no less) and deliver a fine experience for those who like metal-body handsets. The Pixel XL's high-resolution screen, in particular, is appealing as a tool for virtual reality. More importantly, the camera is very good and Google gives Pixel owners unlimited storage of full resolution photos and 4K video. The battery is about average, but wireless performance is good for an unlocked handset. The Pixels belong to a small fraternity of devices that actually run the latest version of Android 7 Nougat. More importantly, the Pixel and Pixel XL run an unadulterated version of Android 7 with the Pixel Launcher on board. That means some neat exclusives, such as the Google Assistant and a commitment from Google for consistent system updates. The 32 GB models cost $649 for the Pixel and $769 for the XL. The 128 GB models cost $100 more each. Verizon sells the Pixel with a two-year financing plan ‚Äî but so does Google. You can snag the Pixel starting at $27 per month, or the XL starting at $32. The phones support LTE Bands: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 7 / 8 / 12 / 13 / 17 / 20 / 25 / 26 / 28 / 29 / 30 / 41, which make them widely compatible with networks around the world. If you want the best of Android and Google services, the Pixel / Pixel XL are the only choice. Buying directly from Google gets you the unlocked version with the option to finance. 2. Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus may not be all that different from the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s generations of hardware, but they are still worth your while. Apple's hardware is outdated, but still high quality. You'll get a good screen, excellent wireless performance, and outstanding camera results. The battery on the 7 Plus is truly amazing. Some might gripe about the lack of a headphone jack, but the waterproof chassis will save the iPhone 7 from the worst spills or accidental dunks in the pool. The user interface from Apple is clean and easy to use, has a wide selection of apps, and useful tools like 3D Touch. Apple updates most of its devices with the latest version of iOS on a regular basis. Though all the national carriers sell iPhones, Apple will let you pick up an unlocked variant through its web site or at an Apple Store. The iPhone 7 starts at $649 and the 7 Plus starts at $769. To get the unlocked model you'll have to pay full price at the register, or finance the phone through Apple's credit card partner. BarclayCardUS will let you buy an iPhone 7 interest free (as long as you have good credit) if you pay it off in 18 months. Both iPhone support LTE Bands: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 7 / 8 / 12 / 13 / 17 / 20 / 25 / 26 / 27 / 28 / 29 / 30 / 40 / 41, which, again, makes them highly compatible with global LTE networks. Be sure to tell Apple you want the "SIM-free" version, which offers the most flexibility for connecting to LTE networks both in the U.S. and abroad. 3. Huawei Mate 9 Huawei's flagship handset is a near masterpiece for the Android set. The Mate 9 is really big thanks to the 5.9-inch screen, but has a pleasing design, lightning fast fingerprint reader, and unique dual-camera system. I wish Huawei had selected a higher-resolution display, but the battery life is absolutely amazing. It delivers ample support for LTE bands, two SIM cards, and other niceties such as expandable storage. The phone ships with Android 7 and a rather aggressive user interface skin from Huawei. Most apps and services run flawlessly. It supports LTE Bands: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 7 / 8 / 12 / 17 / 20 / 26 / 28 / 29 / 40 / 41, which is a very good selection. Huawei sells the phone via its own web site, but also through U.S. online retailers including Amazon, BestBuy, and Newegg. The Mate 9 costs $599, which is a bit less than the Pixel and iPhone. Amazon and BestBuy will offer you interest-free financing through their own branded credit cards (generally over 12-24 months), but Newegg requires the full price. 4. OnePlus 3T Most people probably haven't heard of OnePlus, as this burgeoning, China-based maker of cellphones is still trying to find a clear path into the U.S. market. That shouldn't put you off, as OnePlus makes fine hardware and the OnePlus 3T in particular is a great phone. Things I like about the 3T: great design and build quality, excellent screen, good wireless and battery performance, and a solid camera. OnePlus did a fine job in creating a usable handset that boasts solid specs, but doesn't break the bank. It runs a modified version of Android that OnePlus calls OxygenOS. Don't let the nomenclature put you off: this thing runs really smoothly and is easier to use than the Mate 9's clunkier software. Moreover, OnePlus has already updated the 3T to Android 7 Nougat. It supports LTE Bands: 1 / 2 / 4 / 5 / 7 / 8 / 12 / 17 / 30, which isn't the broadest range, but is still more than adequate for use in the U.S. At $439, the OnePlus 3T is a relative bargain. It's much less painful to pick up than the Pixel or iPhone, and it's nearly as good. You can find it online via OnePlus' web site. It comes in 64 GB and 128 GB variants. I couldn't find any financing options. 5. Motorola Moto Z Play Motorola has a whole series of Z-branded smartphones. The Z Droid, Z Force Droid, and Z Play Droid are all sold by Verizon Wireless. The good news here is that Motorola offers an unlocked version of the Z and Z Play through its web site. The Z Play is the least expensive and lowest-spec'd of the three phones, but that's what makes it the best bargain. The Z Play has the same basic design language of the two high-end phones with performance that's almost as good, and in some respects better. Most importantly, it's compatible with all the same ‚ÄúMoto Mods‚Äù modular accessories of the other Z phones. That means it works with snap-on batteries, speakers, cameras and more, according to Motorola. The Z Play has a nice screen, a good-enough camera, solid wireless performance, and fine build quality. The best feature? The Z Play's battery. This phone offers two days of high-level use, which is far more than most other phones on the market. Toss in a relatively clean build of Android 7 Nougat and you have a winning combo. It supports LTE Bands: LTE 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 7 / 13. This may seem somewhat limited when compared to the Pixel or iPhone, but it works really well on U.S. carriers. The Moto Z Play costs $449. You can customize it from MotoMaker.com. There are no financing options available.

By Tony Baer (Ovum) | February 14, 2017 -- 18:36 GMT (10:36 PST) | Topic: Big Data Analytics Google takes the wraps off, announcing a public beta for the new Cloud Spanner database service. (Image: Google/Usenix.org) Over the past 18 months, Google has transformed itself from sleeping giant to long-term challenger to the likes of AWS and Azure for the cloud. And last summer, Google rolled out key pieces of its data platform including several SQL and NoSQL databases. Read this Hadoop big data analytics: Can SQL support bring it to the masses? For businesses that want to run analytics on low-cost Hadoop clusters, fully compliant SQL is now possible natively on the big data platform, according to Actian. Read More Now, Google has added the last piece of the puzzle. Significantly, it is one that is not (yet) duplicated by AWS or Azure: Google Cloud Spanner. It's one of those legendary Google platforms for which the public has only received access through published research papers. It provides the underlying distributed transaction processing platform for the F1 relational database that powers the core of Google's revenue machine: AdWords. It's been rumored for a while. This week, Google takes the wraps off, announcing a public beta for the new Cloud Spanner database service. It will provide a globally distributed cloud-based transactional database with SQL support and strong consistency, which blows out in scale anything else currently on the market. It is the same Spanner database that Google has described in research papers, but now with an API accessible through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). While Google is pitching it for use cases such as global database consolidation, our take is that in the short run it's best suited for new generation use cases that are being disrupted by data that lives in the cloud, such as global supply chain management. Cloud Spanner takes its place alongside Cloud SQL for more modest ecommerce deployments; Cloud Bigtable as the key/value NoSQL database for large scale reads and writes; Cloud Datastore as the document database for user profiles and online gaming; Big Query for data warehousing; and Cloud Dataproc for Hadoop and Spark. For the most part, Google's database portfolio lines up with Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, but Cloud Spanner is, literally, the big exception. Of course, the key question for Cloud Spanner is whether it's for companies that are not of Google's scale. A hard nut to crack The trick with distributed transaction databases is balancing the conflicting needs for keeping records consistent (the "C" of "ACID") while also keeping the database available. Normally when you update a record, you must lock it to avoid two (or more) conflicting updates coming in at once, cancelling each other out and/or corrupting the data. That means several things. First, the most common use cases for distributed databases have involved either operational scenarios (e.g., updating user profiles, managing live gaming interactions), where ACID requirements are not so steep, or analytics, which won't have the issue of transaction updates. Secondly, transactional database platforms have emerged to deal with the distributed challenge. There was Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters), which relied on a multi-tiered architecture involving a cluster manager. Then came a wave of NewSQL databases that provided varying approaches to maintaining consistency. More recently, sharding became popular with NoSQL data stores such as MongoDB, and SQL transactional databases such as Amazon Aurora and Oracle. With sharding, you're not necessarily distributing the database per se, but partitioning tables across storage arrays to improve access and performance across one or more instances. Big and Consistent Spanner changes our assumptions about scale, such as that transaction databases can't grow as large as analytic ones. While we may have become jaded to the idea of Hadoop clusters running thousands of nodes, Spanner's global scale is mind-boggling: It can run on up to millions of nodes across hundreds of data centers, handling up to trillions of rows. And, by the way, it's designed to run 24/7. Google is positioning Spanner as a fully managed, mission-critical relational database service with Five 9s availability that will deliver strong consistency and global scale. While Google in its research paper termed Spanner as a semi-relational database with a query language that was SQL-like, the commercial offering will be mostly ANSI SQL 2011 compliant. There will also be access through client libraries in languages such as Java, Python, Go, Node.js, and Ruby, and there will be a JDBC driver for integrating with third-party BI and data integration tools. The origins of Spanner should sound familiar: Google developed it when its implementation of MySQL ran out of gas. When it reached tens of terabytes, Google engineers had to manually shard the database -- the last such effort took a couple years. While Google also had Bigtable, a NoSQL database from which HBase was later derived, it wasn't designed for global ACID compliance. Spanner got over that hump with automated sharding and replication that would balance storage of data globally. While Spanner automates placement of data, applications can control where the data physically goes. That is critical for global databases where data sovereignty laws require data to be stored inside national borders or for scenarios where you want to control data locality to optimize performance. Like many distributed transaction databases, it uses a form of Paxos mechanism where commits are determined by a consensus of which node to make the leader (the one that has the authority to commit the change). Google claims that its Paxos implementation is faster than most open source implementations available in the wild. The secret sauce of Spanner is Google's TrueTime API, the global wall clock with operations that are too detailed to review here (the Spanner research paper will tell you plenty). This is what keeps Spanner in sync. Suffice it to say that all commits are time stamped, and time stamps are applied once the system has verified the actual time. Or, to quote the Spanner research paper, "The API directly exposes clock uncertainty... If the uncertainty is large, Spanner slows down to wait out that uncertainty." Well, slowing down in this case means latencies of maybe 10 milliseconds or so. So, who needs all this scalability? The push for distributed transaction databases has been driven by the internet -- where interaction is global and the expectation of customers is for continuous uptime. The classic examples include online commerce or gaming, where customers will not tolerate delays because the database needs to update their record. Google is promoting Cloud Spanner for use cases such as database consolidation or for NoSQL applications that need more robust transactional consistency. The obvious niche is globally distributed applications that require a single consistent database. Global trading systems come to mind; today, these systems are typically divided into multiple regional instances with wide area, near real-time replication. There is also a potential play for database consolidation there. But keep in mind that there is plenty of inertia from enterprises when it comes to switching transaction systems -- and for very good reasons. These systems run the core of the business, which is the last thing you want to disrupt. Unlike analytics or operational use cases, transaction systems typically don't create new revenue opportunities. Transaction processing is highly complex, with household names like Oracle, SQL Server, or DB2 having decades of development behind their robust engines. Challengers to the old order will be considered guilty till proven innocent. For instance, under the covers, Spanner's architecture differs a bit from SQL databases. The onus of proof will be on Google to prove that Spanner has the full SQL compatibility and support that enterprises expect. As challenger, Google will compete on price. But established providers like Oracle won't shrink from pricing wars. The real challenge by Google won't come overnight. But Google is well positioned to play the long game, with the architecture of Spanner being sufficiently unique that it could redefine globalized transaction processing over the long haul.

The "Pangolin Love" Doodle can be played by visiting Google's home page. Players simply use their keyboard to play the game right on the Google website. The story features a pangolin's journey to meet its Valentine in time for dinner. The journey progresses through four different levels as the story unfolds. Google worked with the World Wildlife Fund to raise awareness of the mammal's struggles. According to the WWF website, the pangolin is the only scaly mammal in the world. That features makes the pangolin one of the most trafficked animals in the world. "There are eight species of pangolin, four each¬†in Asia and Africa, and all are under threat, including two species listed as Critically Endangered," the WWF website reads. "Pangolin populations have been devastated by poaching, including at least 80 percent of pangolins in Asia." The two organizations also partnered to use technology to stop potential poachers in the protected areas where the pangolin live. The pangolin Doodle is just the latest video game Google has released on its home page. Other interactive Doodle's include¬†a Rubix cube, a crossword puzzle, and a soccer game.¬† About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy ¬© 2016 MLive Media Group.

What‚Äôs missing from that list is Google‚Äôs Android TV ‚Äì which is surprising. Especially given the staying power of the Android TV platform and the fact that Amazon Fire TV is so extremely similar at its base. It‚Äôs also strange given the attention Facebook has paid to Google‚Äôs video products before ‚Äì like Facebook‚Äôs ability to stream from a smartphone to a Chromecast of Android TV device (which has Chromecast ability within). Facebook‚Äôs Dana Sittler, Product Manager, and Alex Li, Engineering Manager, spoke on the new app this afternoon. ‚ÄúWith the app, you can watch videos shared by friends or Pages you follow, top live videos from around the world, and recommended videos based on your interests.‚Äù This app also allows users to watch a list of videos saved to a ‚Äúwatch later‚Äù list and has a ‚Äúrecently watched‚Äù list of sorts. In other words, it seems like Facebook is once again encroaching in on Google‚Äôs YouTube space. They‚Äôve got a long way to go if they‚Äôre going to get there. For now we‚Äôll assume they mean only to have videos shared from friends and Pages in a very personal way. YouTube remains the major video app for basically every other sort of video watching ‚Äì out in the open. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well Facebook Video ‚Äì the app ‚Äì handles portrait-style (vertical) videos. Facebook‚Äôs Sittler and Li suggest they‚Äôve made changes on the mobile app for Android and iOS to improve the way vertical videos look. If they can do something to account for the strangeness of that format on an always-horizontal TV set, it‚Äôd be amazing. According to Sittler and Li, this app is coming soon. We‚Äôll be giving it a whirl as soon as possible.

Internet Gutter: WikiHow Romance More Tech Disney, YouTube Distance Themselves from PewDiePie By Carli Velocci 02.14.2017 :: 2:15PM EST @velocciraptor Courtesy YouTube YouTube has canceled the upcoming series of immensely popular video personality PewDiePie after he posted several anti-Semitic videos, including one where he paid two men to hold up a sign that said ‚ÄúDeath to All Jews.‚Äù The personality, real name Felix Kjellberg, was preparing for the second season of his scripted Scare PewDiePie, which aired on YouTube Red, the company‚Äôs paid streaming service. He was also dropped from its premier advertising network, Google Preferred, meaning he‚Äôll lose some of his financial backings. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided to cancel the release of Scare PewDiePie season 2 and we‚Äôre removing the PewDiePie channel from Google Preferred,‚Äù a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. The move comes after Disney-owned Maker Studios said on Monday that it was also dropping the online celebrity after a report from the Wall Street Journal that he had uploaded nine anti-Semitic videos. ‚ÄúAlthough Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case, and the resulting videos are inappropriate,‚Äù a Maker Studios spokeswoman said in a statement. ‚ÄúMaker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward.‚Äù The video above, which depicted two men holding up an anti-Semitic sign, was released back in January and has since been removed. The Indian men, who Kjellberg hired through the freelancer site Fiverr, said in a follow-up video that they didn‚Äôt they didn‚Äôt know what the message meant when they made it, or even what ‚ÄúJews‚Äù meant. In another video, a man dressed up as Jesus Christ said: ‚ÄúHitler did absolutely nothing wrong.‚Äù In a statement posted on Tumblr Sunday, Kjellberg said the point of the video was to show how you can get people to say anything for five dollars, not to spout anti-Semitic messages or give credibility to the movement. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAs laughable as it is to believe that I might actually endorse these people, to anyone unsure on my standpoint regarding hate-based groups: No, I don‚Äôt support these people in any way.‚Äù It makes sense that Maker, owned by Disney, would drop the star in response to the controversial statements since it has to maintain its family-friendly brand. YouTube does support a creator‚Äôs rights to satire but draws the line when it comes to certain sensitive subjects, like when you say anti-Semitic things. The service prohibits ‚Äúcontroversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters, and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown.‚Äù PewDiePie has consistently been one of the most popular people on YouTube. Currently, he has over 53 million subscribers. According to Coed.com, he‚Äôs also one of the most financially successful, having earned an estimated $124 million since he started the channel in 2010. So far, PewDiePie hasn‚Äôt released a statement about the controversy. His channel seems to be business as usual, with him posting a Valentine‚Äôs Day video where he and his partner play Genital Jousting. Regardless of whether PewDiePie meant the things he put in his videos, the fact remains he did promote anti-Semitism, which is still a serious problem internationally. Since the US election in November, ThinkProgress has tracked 261 documented hate crimes, with the majority, 26.8 percent, targeting Jewish people. When you post images such as hate speech, you‚Äôre normalizing it, making it okay to distribute. This empowers racists and people who think they can get away with it, even when it can endanger the lives of others. ‚ÄúJust putting it out there brings it more and more into the mainstream,‚Äù Jonathan Vick, an associate director of the Anti-Defamation League, said.

Google launched this a few years ago to ensure mobile security and checking of apps for any malware. Verify Apps allows scanning of apps regularly. It‚Äôs one helpful function but just recently, Google made an update that lets you see the recently scanned apps so you will know the latest activities of the feature. In case you‚Äôre wondering, the Verify Apps menu isn‚Äôt easily seen. It‚Äôs located deep in the settings. Check Google> Security> Verify Apps. If you don‚Äôt see it, that means your software isn‚Äôt updated to the latest version. Either that or your Android phone is really old. The previous version only has few toggles. You can find them in the main Google security menu but this time, you can see them under Verify Apps plus information about the apps scanned and the last time check was made. We don‚Äôt know when this update was released exactly but some people are saying it was also part of the most recent Google Play Services update. It‚Äôs not a major update and not all builds are receiving it. We just want to let you know that there is such so don‚Äôt be surprised if and when you see some changes on your Android device. It‚Äôs not a bug but rather a real tweak.

Actually, you don‚Äôt, but a bizarre bug in some Android users‚Äô Gmail apps demanded that they give the application access to ‚ÄúBody Sensors‚Äù in order to send an email. And now, Gmail is issuing a fix for this, because it‚Äôs as creepy as it is weird. According to reports, some Android owners found that after attempting to send a message via the Gmail app, they‚Äôd receive a notification that an error had occurred.¬†‚ÄúThis app won‚Äôt work properly unless you allow Google Play services‚Äô request to access the following: Body Sensors,‚Äù it read. Needless to say, this wasn‚Äôt something users were down with. Moreover, it‚Äôs been an ongoing issue since at least 2015, though a user more recently¬†posted about the problem in the Gmail Help Forum¬†last September. More:¬†Yahoo Mail gets a couple updates, including caller ID and photo syncing So what was going on? ¬†First of all, Google Play Services is an Android app that is central to your device‚Äôs functionality, providing authentication and synchronized contacts (among other things) across a range of Google apps. It also helps with the speed of offline searches, and in providing more immersive maps, Mashable notes. If you have a fitness app installed on your Android device, for example, Google Play Service needs the Body Sensors permission so it can provide information like the number of steps you‚Äôve taken or your heart rate. Of course, Gmail obviously doesn‚Äôt need that information. Fortunately, the company has finally issued a fix. ‚ÄúThe permission request was the result of a bug in the Drive API within Google Play services, which has now been fixed,‚Äù a representative from Google said in an email on Monday. While you‚Äôre waiting on the fix to be fully rolled out, you can head over to your phone‚Äôs Settings, then go to Apps, and navigate over to Permissions, where you can turn permissions on and off for individual apps.

Sign up now Menu ARN Google‚Äôs new cloud service is a unique take on a database Google‚Äôs new cloud service is a unique take on a database Google Cloud Spanner provides users with a highly available database running on Google's infrastructure Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 15 February, 2017 04:00 - - - - print email Comments IDG Google has turned a database service that it uses to run some of its mission-critical products into an offering for its public cloud customers. On Tuesday, the company launched Cloud Spanner, a new, fully managed database that‚Äôs supposed to provide the transactional consistency of a traditional database plus the scalability and performance of a NoSQL database. It‚Äôs based on the same systems that run the company‚Äôs own Spanner database internally. Usually, businesses have to pick either a traditional or a NoSQL database, and each comes with particular trade-offs. Traditional databases provide better transactional consistency, but can be hard to scale. NoSQL databases are better at scaling but sacrifice consistency. Cloud Spanner is designed to reduce those trade-offs, and it's also delivered as a fully managed service. Among other things, that means Google will manage hardware, software and replication of content for a database that can span multiple data centers. The service will be useful for companies that need millisecond-level consistency in their databases worldwide, according to Nick Heudecker, a research director at Gartner. In an interview, he called out financial services and advertising as two industries that might benefit from Cloud Spanner. Heudecker did point out that the service will require companies to port existing applications, which may prove challenging. Google is working with partners to help customers move over, according to Deepti Srivastava, the product manager for Cloud Spanner. Cloud Spanner has generated more interest than most new Google services, based on response to a closed alpha test, Srivastava said. Cloud Spanner grew out of a project that began in 2007, when a team of Google employees set out to solve the problem of choosing between NoSQL and traditional databases. That led to a paper, published in 2012, describing the company‚Äôs Spanner database, which uses a number of novel techniques, including atomic and GPS clocks inside data centers to maintain time consistency. Spanner is used to operate Google services like AdWords and Google Play. According to the company, it can handle tens of millions of queries per second. That pedigree is a feature of Cloud Spanner that appealed to Peter Bakkum, the platform lead at Quizlet. The education software company, which offers a popular set of study tools for students, is evaluating how to scale its database infrastructure. Quizlet has been testing Cloud Spanner since the closed alpha phase and may end up using the service to replace its existing setup of MySQL databases. Refactoring Quizlet‚Äôs applications to use Cloud Spanner will require work, but that's true of all the possible upgrade paths, Bakkum said. ‚ÄúWe need a fundamentally different architecture to do scaling, and any of those solutions have a difficult migration path,‚Äù he said. Cloud Spanner‚Äôs popularity may be throttled somewhat by Google‚Äôs position in the cloud market. While the company has been aggressive in releasing new capabilities and improving its services to attract new customers, its use still lags behind that of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Using Cloud Spanner means bringing data to Google‚Äôs cloud platform and building an application that targets it. While some companies are comfortable working with multiple cloud providers, not all of them are. That said, Gartner's Heudecker said Google is the only major cloud provider offering a product like this one and it will be hard for rivals to catch up. ‚ÄúCloud Spanner is not just software,‚Äù Heudecker said. ‚ÄúIt is the union of software, hardware ‚Äî in the form of atomic clocks in Google‚Äôs data centers ‚Äî and an incredibly robust network connecting their data centers together. So it‚Äôs not just writing code. It‚Äôs a lot of investment and a lot of operational expertise that Google excels at.‚Äù Right now, Cloud Spanner instances can only exist in one of Google's cloud regions, though they'll be replicated across multiple availability zones inside those regions. In the future, Cloud Spanner customers will be able to have one database that's kept in sync across multiple regions. Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the New Zealand Reseller News newsletter!

By Conner Forrest | February 14, 2017, 10:47 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Google Google's new database service, Cloud Spanner, officially launched into public beta on Tuesday, offering a blend traditional and NoSQL database functionality. According to a Google blog post announcing the service, database administrators typically must make a decision between the transactional consistency of traditional databases or the scaling and distribution offered by NoSQL. However, "Cloud Spanner breaks that dichotomy, offering both of these critical capabilities in a single, fully managed service," the post said. According to the post, Cloud Spanner is a globally distributed relational database service offering both horizontal scaling and high availability. It combines both SQL semantics and ACID transactions. SEE: Google Cloud Platform: The smart person's guide "With its ease of provisioning and scalability, it will accelerate our ability to bring cloud-based omni-channel supply chain solutions to our users around the world," John Sarvari, group vice president of technology at JDA, said in a press release. Data Center Must-Reads Five network diagramming tools that live on the web Video: Why AI and machine learning will increase software developer jobs, not kill them Special report: How to implement AI and machine learning (free PDF) Subscribe to our Data Center Trends newsletter Cloud Spanner is the latest database service to join Google Cloud Platform, joining the likes of Cloud SQL, Cloud Datastore, and Cloud Bigtable. In terms of benefits, the service allows admins to focus on their application logic instead of dealing with hardware and software management, the release said. Additionally, RDBMS solutions can be scaled out "without complex sharding or clustering," and horizontal scaling can be achieved without migration from relational to NoSQL databases. Their service also provides high availability disaster protection, the post said. And, data-layer encryption, identity and access management, and audit logging all provide additional security. Cloud Spanner operates on a pay for what you use model, with pricing determined by compute node-hours, actual storage consumption, and external network access. Additionally, the post said, it "supports distributed transactions, schemas and DDL statements, SQL queries and JDBC drivers and offers client libraries for the most popular languages, including Java, Go, Python and Node.js." Spanner was developed at Google and has been tested and used in-house there for years. There have been talks before about commercializing the service, but questions remained of whether or not Google could attract developers to it. However, with its ability to traverse two popular database types without complex migration, Cloud Spanner could help Google win some more enterprises over to its side in the cloud wars. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google has launched its Cloud Spanner database product into public beta, offering a service that provides traditional and NoSQL database features. Cloud Spanner frees admins up to focus on the application itself, without having to worry so much about hardware and software management. Cloud Spanner was used in-house at Google for a long time and, if marketed correctly, could win Google some more enterprise fans.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Valentine‚Äôs day: what‚Äôs your secret technology crush? 14 Feb 2017 6 Google, Microsoft, Mobile, Technologies, Windows phone Post navigation Previous: News in brief: Cook hits out at ‚Äòfake news‚Äô; Trump under fire; flying cars on the runway Next: Border guards force US citizen to unlock his NASA-owned work phone by Kate Bevan 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Valentine‚Äôs day is traditionally a time when you can act on your secret crushes and let them know how you feel about them. Anyone who cares about security and technology has an app or a platform or a programming language or something that might not be very cool or very glamorous but which they love, trust and rely on. So this year we‚Äôve decided to ask Naked Security writers what their secret crushes are. Mark Stockley, our web technologies guru, has had a long, slightly dysfunctional love-hate relationship with¬†Perl. He says: My secret tech crush is Perl. It‚Äôs not for looks, mind.¬†In a bad light Perl looks like the contents of the unix tool chain after a heavy fall down some stairs. It‚Äôs not because Perl loves me and nobody else either. When I first met Perl (in its prime in the late 90s), it had caught everyone‚Äôs eye and was living it up at the heart of things on seemingly every server and every website. And it‚Äôs not because Perl was nice to me, either.¬†Back then, we didn‚Äôt have well lit safe spaces like Stackoverflow to get to know a programming language that had caught our eye. We had to use usenet and meeting Perl meant risking the piranha-infested waters of comp.lang.misc.perl, a usenet group so fierce and elitist that suitors with questions were publicly eviscerated for sport. Perl is complex‚Ä¶ difficult‚Ä¶ moody, even. On the rare occasions that things go well, working with Perl can be like painting with oils or dancing with Darcey Bussell. But when they aren‚Äôt (and they frequently aren‚Äôt) it can feel like wrestling socks on to an octopus. In fact there are a hundred reasons to choose something else, but for me there is no doubt that it‚Äôs Perl. For all its faults it was my gateway drug, the red pill that led me to late night Slackware installs, unfathomable man pages and scratching my head for two weeks as I looked in the wrong place for Apache‚Äôs ‚Äòit works!‚Äô page. Here at Naked Security, we‚Äôre upfront about our love for password managers and multifactor authentication. But Naked Security stalwart Lisa Vaas¬†fell out of love with hers recently. She says: I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd call this a secret crush. The feelings I have for my password manager are more along the lines of master-sub, with a dash of Stockholm syndrome. The strength of the bondage came clear recently when I lost my phone during a trip. Got off the Metro, but somehow, the phone did not. After a good deal of hand-wringing and fruitless searching , I gave up and ordered a replacement phone courtesy of my insurance company. That‚Äôs when the fun really began. The lost phone had my multifactor authentication (MFA) app on it, Google Authenticator, and without it, I couldn‚Äôt get into any email accounts. The ‚Äúlost password‚Äù hoops Google made me jump through were recursive and failed every time. Using a friend‚Äôs laptop, I tried to reach my password manager vendor (LastPass) to help me out. I could get one toe into LastPass, given that I‚Äôve memorized that one password, but losing my Google Authenticator app on the phone meant that I couldn‚Äôt verify my login with the second factor: the one-time use password Authenticator produces. Turns out that LastPass has no phones. None. OK, so I‚Äôll write to customer support, I thought. Explain the situation, see what they can do to ascertain I‚Äôm not a hacker trying to hijack my account. Automatic LastPass responses kept telling me I‚Äôd get a faster response if I upgraded to premium, and I kept wailing that I am a premium user. Days later, I finally got a response: we‚Äôll send you the instructions to download a new Authenticator instance, they said. To your email address on file. ‚Ä¶ which I couldn‚Äôt get into. I‚Äôll stop there. Suffice it to say that I was rather impressed with the locks and chains set up around my accounts by MFA and that crazy, frustrating password manager. One lesson I learned quite well, after about a week of writhing in those bonds: I need to set up a safe word. What does that extended metaphor translate into? Well, I‚Äôm not going to give it away, but let‚Äôs just say that it‚Äôs along the lines of writing down a password. ‚Ä¶ and then locking that physical token safely (hopefully!) away, not putting it on a sticky note on my monitor! Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Sometimes the old loves are the best, and Naked Security writer Maria Varmazis remains devoted to Notepad++. She tells us: As someone who dabbles in code but primarily writes for a living, my indispensable but slightly-unsexy tool is a text editor. For my PCs, I‚Äôm a Notepad++ fiend. For my Macs, I‚Äôm devoted to SublimeText.¬†(Linux text editing is a sore subject in my household. I cling to emacs, which I picked up in college, while my husband is a vi die-hard. Somehow we‚Äôre still married.) The simplicity of these editors is what makes them so beautiful and so useful. When you just want to write without distraction or frill, there‚Äôs nothing better than opening a simple text editor and getting to work. Text editors let me type without worrying about font and format, or being interrupted by grammatical suggestions ‚Äì and when you‚Äôre on deadline, interruption-free writing is precisely what you need. Once I‚Äôve written what I need and start editing, the built-in line numbering and contextual highlighting many of these text editors come with (handy for folks who are deep in code all day) make my life a lot easier as well. Perhaps my devotion to these humble text editors comes from habit: back in the 90s when so many of my peers and I were learning rudimentary HTML, we went to work with just Notepad. I still remember the humble ‚ÄúMade with Notepad‚Äù buttons some of us would put on our sites as our nerdy badge of honor. Notepad was still my editor of choice in the years following when working on professional website development, Dreamweaver and others be damned. I know a text editor isn‚Äôt the first thing people think of when they need to write, but if you find it hard to get started and the thought of firing up Word makes your blood run cold, open a text editor instead. They provide minimal distractions and render no judgments so you may write freely. And for that, they will always have my devotion. Google may be dominant on the search scene, but not everyone is comfortable with the amount of data it scavenges about users. So Danny Bradbury, our man in British Columbia, tells us why he‚Äôs quietly in love with DuckDuckGo: Google is great at delivering the results you want, in an attractive style. Half the time, thanks to voice search and Google Assistant, you don‚Äôt even have to type anything. But I don‚Äôt like searching for things using a tool run by a company that makes money by selling my data, especially when my work causes me to search for a lot of strange things. Evidence suggests that while Google enables users to switch off the search history that it shows them, it‚Äôs still collecting a lot behind the scenes. DuckDuckGo isn‚Äôt as polished as Google, but I‚Äôm becoming increasingly paranoid about giving my data to large companies, especially given the political uncertainties facing us over the next few years. Perhaps I‚Äôm not the only one, given that DuckDuckGo racked up 4bn searches last year. Love is wide-ranging, and it‚Äôs not just software and applications that Naked Security writers are secretly in love with. Freelancer Bill Camarda has been faithful to a much-loved headset for many years. He tells us: I‚Äôm jaded. I‚Äôve been disappointed too often. My idea of lovable tech is something that just works, doesn‚Äôt demand a lot, didn‚Äôt cost a lot, and stays out of my way the rest of the time. That‚Äôd be my old Logitech ClearChat Comfort USB Headset H390. I mean, this is seriously mature technology. Introduced a decade ago this coming August, you can still buy one new at Amazon. Where you‚Äôre informed that it‚Äôll ‚ÄúElevate the Power of Windows Vista‚Äù. Hey marketers, I love the thing, but please: nothing could do that. Here‚Äôs what it does do: whatever I plug it into ‚Äì Windows 7, 8.x, 10, Mac ‚Äì it goes right to work. No waiting for drivers to fail install. Never crashes the system. Good sound. Good mic that‚Äôs easy to adjust (and moves neatly up out of the way when I‚Äôm only listening.) Handy mute button. Well-made USB cable. Fairly if not perfectly comfy adjustable padded earphones, for today‚Äôs endless Hangouts, Skype videocalls, et al. Not sexy: stable, reliable, there for me. If that‚Äôs not love, what is? Meanwhile, Naked Security freelancer John E Dunn, also has a hardware love: it‚Äôs the privacy- and security-focused Blackphone. He says: From the femtosecond I first saw version 1 in 2014, I‚Äôve wanted one. If they ever get around to making Men in Black 4, this is the smartphone they‚Äôd use. But how to justify paying nearly ¬£600 for an uneventful Android smartphone? One answer is that in an age obsessed with features and looks, the Blackphone strips away all that nonsense and just does the important thing ‚Äì privacy ‚Äì well. Granted, a lot of people think that privacy is another ‚Äòfeature‚Äô but a lot of people are wrong. Security and privacy is the future of everything, the destiny of the world. Finding all of this in a slim black device that can trace its software lineage back to the genesis of popular encryption with Phil Zimmermann‚Äôs PGP just adds to its desirability. It‚Äôs old but new with it. And what about me? I‚Äôve only been editing Naked Security for a few months, but I‚Äôve been writing about technology and security for many years, and so I‚Äôve had plenty of time to fall in love with any number of flighty suitors. But the technology I still love, even though it‚Äôs almost as old and uncool as Donny Osmond (who I saw performing in London earlier this month; I still love him, too) is Windows Phone. I‚Äôve been using Windows devices since back when it was known as Windows CE, and I‚Äôve only ‚Äì reluctantly ‚Äì moved to Android after smashing the screen of my beloved Nokia Lumia 1520 and discovering it would cost ¬£250 to fix (I‚Äôm now rocking a Pixel XL). I love Windows Phone for its elegant design language: instead of dozens of multicoloured icons splattered across several pages there‚Äôs a homescreen of tiles displaying all the information you need at a glance. On my homescreen I could see how many emails were waiting for me, if I‚Äôd missed any calls, which of my key contacts had tried to reach me, if I had any Twitter mentions or DMs, when my next train was, and so on. I also love that it remains a pretty secure platform: there‚Äôs been almost no malware spotted in the wild. And finally, while other manufacturers made Windows Phones, the Lumia range had (and to some, still has) the very best cameras a cellphone could sport: the 1020‚Äôs camera, amazing in its day, is still one to beat.

We met in college. One day I walked over to his dorm and found his CPU in pieces all over his floor. He took it apart just to see if he could. The next morning I returned and saw that he‚Äôd put it back together with no spare parts and it functioned. That was when I knew I loved him.

Another force pushing people out? Money. A lot of it. Early staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersized payouts based on the project‚Äôs value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members didn‚Äôt need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities, according to people familiar with the situation. Two people called it ‚ÄúF-you money.‚Äù In December, the car unit morphed into a standalone business called Waymo, and the system was replaced with a more uniform pay structure that treats all employees the same, according to a person familiar with the situation. Still, the original program got so costly that a top executive at parent Alphabet Inc. highlighted it last year to explain a jump in expenses. A spokeswoman for Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google and ‚ÄúOther Bets‚Äù like the autonomous car business, declined to comment. The payouts contributed to a talent exodus at a time when the company was trying to turn the project into a real business and emerging rivals were recruiting heavily. The episode highlights Alphabet‚Äôs difficult transition from a digital advertising giant into a diversified technology company with varied groups of employees requiring different incentives. Other new businesses, including health care unit Verily, use different compensation systems too, but they have yet to generate huge payouts like the car project. The unorthodox system started in 2010, soon after Google unveiled its first self-driving vehicle. It was constructed to tie employees‚Äô fortunes to the performance of the project, rather than Google‚Äôs advertising money machine. In addition to cash salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity. After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. The multiplier was based on periodic valuations of the division, the people said. The precise metrics that the division was measured by‚Äî and caused the bonuses to balloon‚Äî are not known. But by 2015, the Google car project had come a long way: Google‚Äôs vehicles had logged more than one million autonomous miles; car companies including Toyota Motor and Tesla announced their own plans to develop autonomous systems; and analysts predicted the technology would transform the auto industry. A large multiplier was applied to the compensation packages in late 2015, resulting in multi-million dollar payments in some cases, according to the people familiar with the situation.They asked not to be identified talking about private matters.¬† Part of the problem was that payouts snowballed after key milestones were reached, even though the ultimate goal of the project ‚Äî fully autonomous vehicles provided to the public through commercial services ‚Äî remained years away. It‚Äôs unclear how much the payouts cost Alphabet, however, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat talked about it during an earnings conference call with analysts in early 2016.Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 14 per cent to $6.6 billion, ‚Äúprimarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago,‚Äù Porat said, according to a transcript. The CFO wasn‚Äôt specific, but one of the people familiar with the situation said the comments referred to the car project compensation. Staff departures from the car division increased in 2016. Some were frustrated with the pace of progress and had doubts about new leader John Krafcik, while others wanted to start their own autonomous vehicle companies, people familiar with the matter said. The big payouts exacerbated the situation because team members had less financial incentive to stay, the people familiar with the situation said.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Review: DigitalOcean keeps the cloud simple CloudVelox eases migration of core business apps to the cloud DigitalOcean jumps on the startup support bandwagon Video Getting a bead on tech trends for 2017 Every time Gartner or another analyst firm publishes a report detailing what is happening in the public cloud landscape, three names rise to the top. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is always in first place, and it is only the size of the gap between itself and the next place-getter that changes. The two perennial bridesmaids are Google, with its Cloud Platform offering, and Microsoft, with Azure. You'd be forgiven for thinking that these are the only vendors playing in the public cloud, but in this assessment, you'd be wrong. There are, you see, a plethora of different players. From existing large IT vendors (such as IBM) that want to carve out their own share of the public cloud space, to smaller vendors (many of which come from a traditional hosting background) that want to pivot into the cloud. And others, telcos most notably, looking for a fillip to prop up lost revenue from more traditional business lines. One well-regarded alternative cloud vendor is DigitalOcean. I'm always a little stumped to explain how DigitalOcean has grown so rapidly -- the company came out of essentially nowhere. It was only founded in 2011, and despite battling some incredibly well-resourced vendors, has become (although, as I'll explain, you can take a grain of salt with some of these absolute measures) the second-largest and fastest-growing cloud computing platform in the total number of public-facing apps and websites, according to Netcraft.com. Of course, sheer numbers of users -- or of websites being run on a platform -- is a very different metric from the amount of revenue a platform is generating. Under this metric, the real number of import is the enterprise customers committing to a platform. In this regard, AWS, Azure and Google are winning the race -- as Snap's recent S1 documentation and its multibillion dollar commitment to both Amazon's and Google's cloud shows. Notwithstanding the statistics, however, the fact is that DigitalOcean has grown impressively well, this despite having a very simple product offering that misses out on many (most?) of the higher-value services that its more well-developed competitors offer. So when Julia Austin, a former executive with VMware, was snapped up to fill the role of CTO at DigitalOcean, all eyes were on the changes she would make. VMware is, of course, one of the more important suppliers to most enterprise IT departments and, as such, Austin has a deep understanding of both customer requirements and, perhaps more importantly, what it takes to build a sustainable and viable technology vendor. And today we see the first step in that change with the announcement that DigitalOcean is releasing its load balancing product offering. Load balancers are, according to DigitalOcean, the feature most often requested by customers, and that is an assertion that rings true. Beyond all but the smallest of workloads, organizations need to use load balancers to ensure that traffic across their infrastructure is distributed evenly. As DigitalOcean approaches more heavy customer use-cases, it needs to offer this functionality to avoid customers migrating to more mature cloud platforms as their needs increase. In DigitalOcean's implementation, load balancers can be controlled from either a customer's control panel or alternatively programmatically via API. No additional installation or configuration is required. Using load balancers, organizations can distribute their traffic to only healthy Droplets -- DigitalOcean's own term for its cloud servers -- ensuring no single point of failure exists. Load balancers are priced at $20 per month, following DigitalOcean's traditional cheap and simple pricing approach. In commenting about the release, Austin hints at more developments to come. "We're quickly expanding the capabilities of our cloud to support larger scale-out applications," she said. "With "Load Balancers, we are providing developers and businesses with a simple service for maximizing the availability and reliability of applications without disrupting the end user experience. Load Balancers is the first major new product DigitalOcean has released this year. Over the coming year, you'll see us continue to release a number of important products and features to meet our customers' high availability, data storage, security and networking needs." DigitalOcean is something of an enigma, the little engine that could (as it were). Load balancing will increase the level at which it "can," and the future will be interesting to watch.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 February 2017 by Military News Mobile Optimization Increases in Importance in 2017 Switch Lead provides mobile SEO services to help websites boost Google rankings PHILADELPHIA, PA ‚Äì FEBRUARY 14, 2017 ‚Äì Your business will likely lose out on customers if its website isn‚Äôt optimized for mobile devices. The Switch Lead search engine optimization firm provides mobile SEO services to help you break that trend. Google rolled out its mobile-friendly algorithm over the past two years, boosting the ranking of mobile-friendly websites. It reportedly works both ways. Having a website optimized for mobile devices can boost your Google rankings, while not having a mobile-optimized website can lower rankings. Google recognizes that it isn‚Äôt enough to have websites optimized for desktop users. The search engine giant provides a website that tests whether web pages are mobile-friendly. Why should business owners care whether their websites are mobile-friendly? The desktop version of a website may be difficult to view and use on a mobile device. Users must pinch or zoom into the site so that they can read the content. This can cause mobile device users to be frustrated and search elsewhere for the information they need. Strategies designed to brand companies and increase online marketing should definitely include how to reach mobile-device users. A Pew Research Center survey shows that 95 percent of Americans now own a cellphone, including 77 percent who own a smartphone. That‚Äôs up from 35 percent when Pew conducted its first survey of smartphone ownership in 2011.¬† More people are searching on-the-go. They are also searching the web more for services and products available in their community. The days of potential customers grabbing their phone books are over. They now search online to find companies in their community. That changes what keyword phrases they use to find answers. Boosting local search engine results takes knowing what people are typing in to find products and services in their city. Mobile SEO experts like Switch Lead give business owners an edge when it comes to local search engine optimization. Switch Lead starts with a full website SEO audit to determine what improvements a website needs. It analyzes every aspect of a website including: ‚Ä¢ Site architecture ‚Ä¢ URL slugs ‚Ä¢ Content ‚Ä¢ Navigation systems ‚Ä¢ Linkings to internal pages ‚Ä¢ Backlinks that link from other sites to your web pages The search engine optimization firm focuses on creating high-quality content to boost the authority of a company‚Äôs website. It diversifies content to help increase traffic and engagement. Switch Lead‚Äôs SEO strategy includes using location keywords related to a business‚Äôs location. Customers often include the name of their city in their search queries. Switch Lead prepares for this. The higher a business ranks in Google, the more likely a customer will pay attention. Switch Lead helps companies make the changes needed to increase their Google search engine ranking.

APKUpdater Finds Updates To Your Apps Without The Google Play Store Eric Ravenscraft Feb 15, 2017, 6:00am ‚ãÖ Filed to:¬† android android downloads apk xda Share Android: For most users, the Google Play Store is the best way to find apps and keep them updated. If you're using a non-Google ROM or downloading apps from outside the store, APKUpdater can help keep you up to date. This app, created by XDA user rumboalla, scans your list of apps and then finds updates for those apps on sites like APKMirror. It can also optionally scrape the Google Play Store itself to find app updates. It won't automatically install the new versions, though. You'll have to download and install them one-by-one. However, it's still helpful to find out when an update is available. This might not be necessary for most situations, but if your custom ROM doesn't have Google Play, or if you're avoiding it for privacy reasons, this is a handy way to fill in the gaps.

Disney's Maker Studios and Google‚Äôs YouTube are distancing themselves from Kjellberg after he made jokes about anti-Semitism and posted Nazi imagery in his videos , FILE PHOTO, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By MAE ANDERSON / The Associated Press Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF NEW YORK ‚Äì Disney‚Äôs Maker Studios and Google‚Äôs YouTube are distancing themselves from a top YouTube star after he made jokes construed as anti-Semitic and posted Nazi imagery in his videos. Felix Kjellberg, known online as PewDiePie, has the most popular YouTube channel, with more than 53 million subscribers. The Swedish YouTube star rose to fame by posting videos of him playing and commenting about video games. More recently, he branched out into non-gaming videos that show him performing skits, stunts or making jokes. Disney, whose Maker Studios runs Kjellberg‚Äôs channels and network, said he crossed the line with some of his videos. One video from January shows two Indian men paid by Kjellberg to hold up a sign that says ‚ÄúDeath to all Jews.‚Äù Kjellberg said the video was meant to demonstrate how far people will go if they get paid to do something, but he didn‚Äôt think they would actually do it. Other videos show Nazi imagery in a satirical way. In blog post Kjellberg said he was making jokes, but realizes now that they were offensive. Kjellberg‚Äôs channel was already part of Maker Studios when the Walt Disney Co. bought Maker in 2014 for $675 million. Maker contracts with individuals such as Kjellberg to produce videos for various YouTube channels. Kjellberg pulled the video showing the two men displaying the anti-Semitic sign, but it is excerpted in a Wall Street Journal video. Other videos still on the site show Nazi imagery being used satirically. Maker Studios said in a statement that while Kjellberg‚Äôs channel is popular because he is irreverent and provocative, the studio is ending its affiliation with him because he went too far. YouTube spokeswoman Michelle Slavich said YouTube has canceled the release of the second season of Kjellberg‚Äôs reality show ‚ÄúScare PewDiePie‚Äù and removed the PewDiePie channel from its Google Preferred advertising program, which aggregates top YouTube content for advertisers to buy time on.

Thomas Meunier, Adrien Rabiot, Marco Verratti, Angel Di Maria and Julian Draxler were the stand-out performers on an evening that wll prompt no end of think pieces about a changing of the European guard. They might be a bit premature, but Barcelona came up woefully short tonight - their makeshift defence just couldn‚Äôt cope, their midfield was non-existent and they failed to score for only the second time in any competition this season. They‚Äôll need little short of a miracle to turn this one around in three weeks time. Edinson Cavani is congratulated by Barcelona‚Äôs Luis Suarez.

He‚Äôs probably right, but nobody likes a snitch and Szymon Marciniak keeps his card in his pocket. From the ensuing free-kick, Neymar shoots high over the cross-bar.

The Catalan side have been extraordinarily poor, but have not been allowed to play by PSG. The French champions have been outstanding in attack and defence and have completely bossed midfield.

Do torrent sites even need Google and other search traffic? Google and other search engines will allegedly take action to reduce search traffic on torrent websites. By Prasid BanerjeePrasid Banerjee Published Date 14 - Feb - 2017 | Last Updated 15 - Feb - 2017 Tweet ¬† ZTE Blade A2 Plus (Grey, 32 GB) 11999 My first introduction to peer-to-peer file sharing was with something called Limewire. The combination of an incredibly fast 56 kbps dial-up connection and a Pentium III PC with less RAM than most smartphones today, made the process of downloading content friggin impossible, unless you were me. I used Limewire to create a collection of 500GB of music over the years, transitioning to broadband Internet over time. This was accompanied by about 200GB of movies, some e-books and a 5GB collection, meant only for setup files for various software. I did all that, wondering how the Internet can give it to me for free, and though I stream or pay for all my content today, it‚Äôs tough to deny the convenience and sheer variety of content I could access with just a few hours of downtime. Faster the Internet speeds, more I downloaded. Now that brings us to the topic at hand. Is Google banning our much loved torrent websites? In a word, the answer is no. No one knows what the ‚Äúvoluntary code of conduct‚Äù between search engines and copyright holders is. What these copyright holders want is for infringing links to not show up on search results, or at least show up less. Google and company is presumably going to tweak their algorithms to achieve the same, hence reducing search traffic to torrent aggregators and websites guilty of content piracy. This brings us to the question: do these websites even need search traffic? Torrent Websites When I finally stopped using Limewire, which was a P2P client that would allow both search and download, I switched to a well known torrent aggregator, called Torrentz. While Torrentz itself was shut down recently, it has sprung back up in a whole new avataar. Me and many others who pirate or have pirated content online, usually have set places to go to. Unlike searching for news or content websites, you don‚Äôt always need Google to find you the right spot. You need it, perhaps for the first search, but once you‚Äôve identified the website, you‚Äôll never open Google.com for it again. Torrentz is a glowing example of the same, as is the fact that SimilarWeb shows 13.10 million visits to Fastpiratebay, a PirateBay proxy. SimilarWeb also shows 4.4 million visits to pirate.trade and 1 million visits for bay.tv, two other Piratebay proxy websites. Despite being banned earlier, Kickasstorrents‚Äô newest avataar, https://katcr.co/, gets 15.7 million visits, according to SimilarWeb. For the uninitiated, SimilarWeb is a digital market intelligence company that can track website traffic for free. Websites infringing copyrights Torrents are part of this conversation because to the copyright holder, they‚Äôre the most dangerous. You can download a torrent file, create copies of it and then distribute it further. However, they‚Äôre not the only form of online piracy that the ‚Äúvoluntary code of conduct‚Äù should concern itself with. Here again, though, Google or any other search engine is instrumental in discovering the website, unless of course you just simply ask your piracy crazy friend. One of the most visited websites in this domain is onwatchseries.to, which has a virtually unending catalogue of TV Shows that you can play for free. SimilarWeb puts the total visits to this website at 67 million, while watchfree.to, the Putlocker alternative stands at about 43 million total site visits. Torrent Clients While Limewire is long dead, torrent clients exist and are instrumental in the pirate-verse. The most common, Bittorrent and uTorrent do not allow you to search on their desktop clients, but others, like qBittorrent, do allow you to search within their desktop clients. In essence, they‚Äôre torrent aggregators and downloaders, all in one simple solution. Another such torrent client is Vuze, which has the Vuze HD Network built into the app, for simpler and more trustworthy search. Search traffic may be reduced Over the years, Google has maintained a somewhat neutral stance on privacy. While the Search giant has acquiesced to many takedown requests, it has also been a proponent of anti-censorship on the Internet. The question of whether Google itself is responsible for censoring content is a debate for another day, but the fact remains that the company hasn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúblocked‚Äù or ‚Äúbanned‚Äù these websites actively up till now. Google takes takedown requests and processes them regularly, but one needs to show proper reason. Here‚Äôs an example of how Google fights online piracy. I‚Äôm making an assumption here, but search engines should simply be pushing these websites lower in search rankings. If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôll actually browse over to the other pages, but most won‚Äôt. So, yes, traffic coming from search engines may be affected, which means my mother will find it quite difficult to find torrents or her searches for ‚Äúwatch XYZ movie online free‚Äù may come back empty, but for the pro torrent users, this move matters not.

According to a¬†Bloomberg¬†report, the financial incentive to leave the project and hit the bricks was so great, many realized they couldn‚Äôt afford not to quit. And, in the grand tradition of pulling up employment stakes, many enjoyed the fact that their departure cost the company big, big bucks. In many cases, those employees used the money to become¬†Google competitors. Before the shrinking self-driving car unit was spun off into the Waymo entity back in December (bringing a normal payment structure to the workforce), the amount of compensation was apparently tied to the value of the project itself. Google expected big things from its autonomous driving project, so the value soon reached stratospheric levels. So great was the potential compensation that long-standing team members realized they‚Äôd be foolish not to grab Google‚Äôs cash and jump ship to another company. The exodus that began in 2015 was in full force early last year. With brainpower waning and the project‚Äôs objective growing increasingly hazy, Google ultimately turned the unit into a self-driving technology company. Two sources referred to Google‚Äôs hefty compensation payouts as, ‚ÄúFuck you money.‚Äù The payment system, created in 2010, saw some employees given equity in the company and bonuses tied to the unit‚Äôs valuation. Each individual cash pile grew over time, especially after Google added a multiplier to its value in 2015. One team member saw a multiplier of 16 placed on four years‚Äô worth of bonuses. According to sources, several of the payouts amounted to several millions of dollars. Ka-ching!¬†Alphabet Inc., the holding company controlling Google (and now Waymo), claimed last year that the payouts were partly responsible for a spike in R&D costs. Now flush with dough, many of the former executives began work on their own autonomous startups¬†‚Äî businesses that now compete with their former employer. Among the castaways is¬†Bryan Salesky, founder of Argo AI. If the name sounds familiar, it should. Just last week, Ford Motor Company invested $1 billion into his Pittsburgh-based artificial intelligence company. Google‚Äôs generosity has proved a boon to its competitors.

Login to reply stuki February 14th, 2017 at 8:42 pm About as many as I can name California based companies successfully building and selling autonomous vehicles‚Ä¶. Thing is, the division of labor are increasingly such that Asian (and even Euro‚Ä¶) companies are building the components, and infrastructure supporting building the components, that look likely to be utilized by autonomous vehicle systems some time in the future. While the California based ones are‚Ä¶. building stock certificates, hype and zoning laws making it too expensive to hire enough engineers to compete effectively at much else. Look at Google, hardly famous for playing host to some unparalleled concentration of straight up idiots: Does the folly described in the article strike you as a cost effective way to develop anything at all? Do you think the Manhattan project was ran along those lines? What about Toyota‚Äôs autonomous vehicle tech programs? Hyundai‚Äôs? Bosch‚Äô? Silicon Valley has become so hollowed out over the past twenty years it no longer bears any resemblance to it‚Äôs former self. Like a friend of mine says: ‚ÄúHP was started in a garage. Nowadays, no young engineer can afford a house with a garage.‚Äù But, the banksters sure can. And the lawyers‚Ä¶.. One can live off of make believe valuations based on what is increasingly tilted towards mere cultural exports and Stanford dormroom scifi dreams for only so long, before ones lack of clothes and serious fundamentals become obvious to even the most starry eyed of hype consumers. And when the mood swings, there is an absolutely ridiculously long, and getting longer all the time, way down, before one hits any support of substance.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives. Verizon finally brought back one of its most popular plans this week, with the return of unlimited data. The new plans start at $80 per month (plus taxes and fees) for a single line, $140 for two lines, and¬†$20 per phone/tablet line after that. For years, Verizon customers who wanted unlimited data were stuck in limbo between two choices: Stick with your old phone and your grandfathered unlimited data plan or switch carriers. According to Verizon, with the new plan the network may "queue" your download behind other users after you've downloaded 22GB of data if there's network congestion. That could limit your speeds briefly, but it's still a compelling option for data-hungry users. The problem? Most phones that work on AT&T and T-Mobile don't work on Verizon, so switching will probably require getting a new phone. If you're thinking about switching or upgrading, these are the best phones we've tested. Note that these monthly prices are stretched over a 24-month agreement if you're paying full price. Also worth noting: If you've got a recent iPhone or Galaxy phone in good working condition then Verizon has a deal where you can trade that in and get an iPhone 7, 7 Plus, Google Pixel, or LG V20 for $0¬†(with a few conditions). The monthly cost will still be on your bill, but you'll receive a credit that cancels it out each month. 1. Google Pixel ($27.08/mo or $649) The new Google Pixel is a world-class smartphone that runs a clean version of Android. ¬†(Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) One of our favorite phones right now is the Google Pixel. It runs a beautiful version of stock Android that is simple to use and includes the new Google Assistant. By far the best feature is the camera, which is among the best we have ever tested. The phone even comes with unlimited, full-resolution uploads to Google Photos, which we think is a must-have app for literally everybody. Buy the Gogle Pixel ($27.08/mo or $649) 2. Apple iPhone 7 Plus ($32.08/mo or $769) The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is big, but its dual camera is the best we've ever tested. ¬†(Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) Apple's iPhone 7 Plus doesn't have a headphone jack, but it does have an amazing camera and excellent battery life. While we're not happy about the whole headphone jack thing, the camera is worth it as long as you don't mind carrying around the included Lightning dongle. The camera is the best we've seen yet in low light from a smartphone, and the second camera gets a bit closer to your subject, which is perfect for portraits. The regular Apple iPhone 7 is a good alternative if you want something smaller and slightly cheaper, but note that it doesn't have the second portrait camera and it has a smaller battery. Buy the Apple iPhone 7 Plus ($32.08/mo or $769) 3. Samsung Galaxy S7 ($28/mo or $672) The Samsung Galaxy S7 is an amazing smartphone that has none of the troubles of the Note 7. ¬†(Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) Samsung's reputation took a big hit with the whole Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, but it still knows how to make a great smartphone. The Galaxy S7 is the company's flagship smartphone, and it has everything that made the Note 7 such a great phone and none of the design flaws that forced its recall. I used one for over six months with no problems, so it's a safe bet. Buy the Samsung Galaxy S7 ($28/mo or $672) 4. Apple iPhone SE ($16.66/mo or $399.99) The Apple iPhone SE is shaped like an iPhone 5S, but has the guts of a newer phone. ¬†(Photo: Reviewed.com / Michael Desjardin) If you've been hanging onto an old iPhone 5S and you can't stand the newer large-screen phones, the iPhone SE is our favorite option. It has the same design as the iPhone 5S, but with a processor and camera combo that's more in line with the iPhone 6S. It's not as fast as the iPhone 7, but if you love that old design it's the best small-screen phone around. It's also just $400 bought outright, so if you're not eligible for a trade-in discount, it's a great way to keep your monthly costs down and still get a great phone. Buy the Apple iPhone SE ($16.66/mo or $399.99) Check out Reviewed.com to read more reviews of the best smartphones, including our dynamically-updated list of the best phones for Verizon Wireless. Correction: This article originally incorrectly stated the price of the Verizon Unlimited plan with two lines. That has been updated and we regret the error. Verizon also claims that the new plan will not "throttle" speeds after 22GB, but it may¬†queue your downloads behind other users in the event of network congestion, which could limit your speeds.

In typical Google fashion, not all supported devices running the most current versions of 7.0 Nougat are receiving Instant Apps immediately ‚Äî the company appears to be rolling out the feature slowly, without notifying users.¬†You can check if your¬†phone is ready to start running Instant Apps by visiting¬†the Google > Services submenu inside Settings. Eligible devices will have a toggle for Instant Apps, where the user can opt in. More:¬†Google‚Äôs Instant Apps allows you to use apps without installing them If you‚Äôre one of the chosen few, the method for finding Instant Apps is still a bit counter-intuitive in these early stages. Users have to search for them in Chrome, and currently there are only four known examples: Buzzfeed, Viki, Periscope, and Wish. With any luck, a search result near the top labeled ‚ÄúInstant‚Äù should appear, and you can follow that link to run the app. At this point, not all of the apps are working in all cases, and 9to5Google says¬†it is unclear which devices and versions of Android will receive the feature first. Google has stated it is targeting 4.1 Jelly Bean forward for the full release. Google is pitching Instant Apps as a solution to the problem of having to install an app you‚Äôll only use once, or just want to test-drive. Think of them as smaller, stripped-down versions of existing apps that disappear from the¬†device the moment they are closed. When Google announced the initiative in May of last year, it said that about ‚Äúhalf a dozen‚Äù partners had agreed to¬†embrace the format, including B&H Photo Video, Medium, Hotel Tonight, Zumper, Disney, and the aforementioned Buzzfeed.¬†Instant Apps seem particularly beneficial¬†for uncommon services, like hotel hunting, or impromptu shopping needs, so look forward to similar apps joining the list later on.

PewDiePie, real name Felix Kjellberg, has seen premium advertising links cut by the site after several videos posted by the vlogger in recent months were found to contain anti-Semitic imagery and references to Nazism. The Swede, who has more than 53 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, is reported to have made around 15 million dollars (¬£12 million) though Google-owned YouTube in 2016. White A post shared by PewDiePie (@pewdiepie) on Feb 3, 2017 at 1:38pm PST He said he accepts the material ‚Äì which included an abusive sign and Nazi imagery ‚Äì was offensive, but was ‚Äúin no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes‚Äù. In response, YouTube said it was cutting some of its ties with the video producer by cancelling a new series of his reality show due to be screened on the platform, and reducing his channel‚Äôs promotion to advertisers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve decided to cancel the release of Scare PewDiePie Season 2 and we‚Äôre removing the PewDiePie channel from Google Preferred,‚Äù a YouTube spokeswoman said. (Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) Google Preferred is an aggregated list of YouTube content aimed at potential advertisers. On Monday, the vlogger‚Äôs business parter Maker Studios, which is owned by Disney, also dropped the star after the Wall Street Journal raised concerns over some content in his videos. ‚ÄúAlthough Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate,‚Äù Maker Studios said in a statement. ‚ÄúMaker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward.‚Äù Google logo on the screen of a mobile phone Kjellberg said the aim of his videos is to entertain his followers. ‚ÄúI make videos for my audience. I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know my audience understand that and that is why they come to my channel. Though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive. ‚ÄúAs laughable as it is to believe that I might actually endorse these people, to anyone unsure on my standpoint regarding hate-based groups: No, I don‚Äôt support these people in any way.‚Äù Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS ¬† Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media ¬† Google patents system to reduce injuries to pedestrians, cyclists when self-driving cars hit them By Ethan Baron / February 14, 2017 at 9:34 AM No matter how good self-driving cars become at avoiding roadway hazards, much will remain out of their control. Take¬†Jimmy, for example. See Jimmy run. He‚Äôs chasing a ball, and he‚Äôs screened completely from view by a parked delivery truck until the moment his sneakers¬†hit the street. See Jimmy fly ‚Äî but not very far: He‚Äôs been hit by a Google self-driving car. In this manufactured scenario, the vehicle¬†that strikes Jimmy is equipped with an impact-reduction system Google¬†has invented. ‚ÄúThe technology relates to reducing the likelihood of injuries or damage to objects such as pedestrians, bicyclists, animals, other vehicles, or simply inanimate objects caused by collisions with vehicles,‚Äù said an autonomous-vehicle patent granted Feb. 14 to Google. The company¬†has spun off its robot-car program into its own company, Waymo, which now falls under Google parent firm Alphabet. The patent modifies the concept of the ‚Äúcrumple zone‚Äù built into many vehicles, where materials are intended to deform to absorb energy in a collision, reducing potential impact on occupants. Google tweaked this idea, adding computerization and sliding panels. ‚ÄúComputing devices within a vehicle may determine that an impact with an object cannot be avoided by way of braking, steering, and/or accelerating the vehicle,‚Äù the patent¬†said. ‚ÄúWhen this is the case, the computing devices may work to adjust the amount of force necessary to break one or more shear pins which are holding a panel of the vehicle in place. ‚ÄúThe force of impact on the object which the vehicle collides may be reduced, thereby limiting the severity of injuries and/or damage to the object.‚Äù The car‚Äôs panels would be mounted on sliders. When a collision is imminent,¬†the tapered ‚Äúshear pins‚Äù preventing the panels from moving¬†backward would move into a position where they‚Äôre more easily broken, allowing the car‚Äôs panels to slide backward in a crash and absorb impact. The system could account to some degree for, say, the difference between Jimmy and his neighbor‚Äôs escaped llama or another car, as the pins would need to break under different amounts of force depending on the heft of what‚Äôs struck. ‚ÄúThe characteristics of the object with which impact is imminent may be used to determine to adjust the amount of shear force necessary to break the one or more shear pins, in an effort to minimize the impact force felt by the object,‚Äù the patent said. ‚ÄúThe size of an object may be used to estimate its mass. This in turn may be used to determine the appropriate amount of shear force for the shear pins.‚Äù Whether Waymo intends to use this system in its autonomous vehicles remains unclear: many technologies are patented but never see the light of day. That said, this robot-car technology seems more likely to appear on vehicles than another system Google has patented, in which the car‚Äôs hood is coated with glue, covered by a thin hard shell that would break upon impact with a pedestrian, so the hapless biped would stick¬†to the hood rather than getting hurled into a harder object or the roadway. ¬† Photo: A Google self-driving car travels eastbound on San Antonio Road in October 2015 in Mountain View.

Some early reviewers of the Samsung Chromebook Pro characterized it as a "MacBook killer," but others were more restrained in their enthusiasm. Jointly developed with Google and first demoed at CES 2017, the Chromebook Pro is slated for release next month. Samsung's Chromebooks basically are lightweight productivity tools that rely heavily on access to cloud-based resources. They have gained popularity in the enterprise for use with remote workers and in educational settings as entry-level computing tools. However, they "are no Mac killers," said Werner Goertz, a research director at Gartner. Price Point The Chromebook Pro will sell for US$550. Some reviewers, including PC Magazine's Victoria Song and Ars Technica's Valentina Palladino, considered it pricey. However, that pricing fits into the normal laptop budget, noted Wired reviewer David Pierce . "I don't want to spend $1,000-plus on a PC or Mac when I could get something like the Samsung Chromebook Pro for $549," Forbes' Shelby Carpenter remarked. "Access to the Google Play store and the Android apps ecosystem, combined with the freemium productivity suites such as Slack, make [Chromebooks] a viable option for remote workers," Gartner's Goertz told TechNewsWorld, "and Samsung's carefully selected price points are justified vis-a-vis the slightly less expensive competition." Design and Battery Life The rounded edges and exposed hinge give the Chromebook Pro "a decidedly utilitarian look," Wired's Pierce noted, which is "just fine." Though the Pro is light and small, its squarish shape is "a little awkward when typing," according to PC Magazine's Song. Its design struck Ars Technica's Palladino as "solid." "I got my hands on the device at CES, and i was impressed with how thin and light it was while not feeling like a typical flimsy plastic Chromebook," noted Eric Smith, a senior analyst at Strategy Analytics. The Chromebook Pro's battery life is "only beat by the much more expensive Chromebook Pixel 2 and the Dell Chromebook 13," said Ars reviewer Palladino. However, it "pales in comparison to what we saw" from various Asus Chromebook models, said PC Magazine's Song, who noted that results of two tests varied substantially. The Quad HD Screen The Chromebook Pro's 2400 x 1600 Quad HD LED display "is virtually indistinguishable from my Mac screen," Forbes' Carpenter said. The display "makes the entire device taller than most 16:9 laptops and two-in-ones," observed Palladino. That allows a larger palm rest and more space for the user's hands, but a huge bottom bezel and a hardware strip for the hinges to attach to the lid leave "a bunch of empty space," he pointed out. The display offers a much higher resolution than typically found in 11- or 13-inch Chromebooks, Song said, but the 3:2 aspect ratio means it's more square-shaped. That leaves little room on either side of the keyboard, making the typing experience somewhat awkward. The Stylus and Android Apps Although the included stylus drew generally favorable remarks, "the quality of the inking wasn't as impressive as Windows or iOS devices at similar price points," Strategy Analytics' Smith told TechNewsWorld. Reviewers liked the Chromebook Pro's access to the huge number of Android apps in the Google Play store. However, some Android apps don't play well with Chrome, they noted. "Some apps don't recognize the keyboard and trackpad; others seem unable to handle a touchscreen," Wired's Pierce pointed out. "Most crash constantly," and switching between apps can be clumsy, said Song. Still, "I was able to do most of my daily work on the Chromebook Pro without major problems," Palladino remarked, adding that it "performed faster than my MacBook Air." Right Direction The convertible Chromebook segment is expanding rapidly, according to Linn Huang, a research director at IDC. "Most have been underpowered, small-screen, low-cost offerings, [and] Samsung's Chromebook Pro marks an evolution towards the premium end," he told TechNewsWorld. In general, Chromebooks "have largely been a K-12 phenomenon," suggested Huang, and they need more work to succeed in the larger consumer market as a category.

Re: Samsung's Chromebook Pro Earns Respect gamul1Posted 2017-02-15 I agree that in most respects this Chromebook looks to be excellent. The review touches on a lot of what is good and I agree with it. I will focus on the one flaw this device has that ultimately will spell its doom as a valid product in this market space. Bottom line: 32GB of storage is simply not enough for a device that can install thousands of Play Store apps. This isn't simply a Chromebook any more. Gone are the days when all it really needs is to browse the web and have enough space to store the basics. This has now crossed into the world of table as well and both Google and Samsung were short sighted to limit this device to 32GB. Yes, it has a micro SD card for expandable storage, but both these companies should know that large numbers of android apps dont run properly, if ...

Sean Gallagher - Feb 14, 2017 6:05 pm UTC Enlarge / A phishing e-mail aimed at worker rights activists in Qatar and Nepal crafted to fool targets into giving up their credentials. Amnesty International reader comments 19 Share this story Over the course of the last year, a number of human rights organizations, labor unions, and journalists were targeted in a "phishing" campaign that attempted to steal the Google credentials of targets by luring them into viewing documents online. The campaign, uncovered by Amnesty International, is interesting largely because of the extent to which whoever was behind the attack used social media to create a complete persona behind the messages‚Äîa fictional rights activist named Safeena Malik. Malik translates from Arabic as "King," so Amnesty International refers to the spear-phishing campaign in a report posted to Medium today as "Operation Kingphish." The party or parties behind the operation created Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and Twitter profiles for "Safeena Malik" using a young woman's photos, which were apparently harvested from another social media account. "It appears that the attackers may have impersonated the identity of a real young woman and stole her pictures to construct the fake profile," wrote Nex, a security researcher working with Amnesty International, "along with a professional biography also stolen from yet another person." While there was only one post on the Twitter account associated with the constructed identity‚Äîa one-word "hi" post when the account was created in December 2014‚Äî"she" was much more active on Facebook and LinkedIn (where the identity had accumulated more than 500 connections). The operators behind the "Safeena Malik" identity used their amassed contacts to specifically target people associated with the rights of migrant workers in Qatar‚Äîjournalists, activists, and labor union officials. Amnesty International was not directly targeted in the campaign. Large numbers of workers from Nepal and other countries have been brought to Qatar, particularly to perform construction work on stadiums and facilities for the 2022 World Cup‚Äîand there have been concerns raised over the treatment of those workers. So far, more than 1,200 migrant workers from Nepal and India have died working on the World Cup projects. Targets would receive e-mails and social media messages from "Safeena Malik" in bursts, asking them to look at documents or presentations on Qatari human rights issues or offering¬†forged requests to link up via Google's Hangouts chat service. The phishing e-mails would lead to a phishing site crafted specifically for the targets, presenting their (harvested) Google account avatar as part of a page mimicking a Google account login. After capturing their credentials (in the cases where the links purported to be for documents), the page would forward them to an actual Google Docs document pilfered from another source to reduce suspicions about what had happened. The campaign bears all the hallmarks of the textbook social media/social engineering campaign "Robin Sage," an experiment by security researcher Thomas Ryan. Ryan created a fake profile on Facebook for Robin Sage‚Äîa young, attractive ‚ÄúCyber Threat Analyst‚Äù at Naval Network Warfare Command. ("Robin Sage" is also the name of the two-week final exercise that Army Special Forces candidates are put through eight times a year at Fort Bragg, North Carolina‚Äîwhich one might have thought would have tipped off someone.) In his research, presented at the Black Hat conference in 2010, Ryan reported: By the end of this experiment, Robin finished the month having accumulated hundreds of connections through various social networking sites. Contacts included executives at government entities such as the NSA, DOD and Military Intelligence groups. Other friends came from Global 500 corporations. Throughout the experiment Robin was offered gifts, government and corporate jobs, and options to speak at a variety of security conferences‚Ä¶Through this 28‚Äêday experiment, it became evident that the propagation of a false identity via social networking websites can be rampant and viral. Much of the information revealed to Robin Sage violated OPSEC and PERSEC procedures. It is not known who is behind the phishing campaigns. But some of the accounts that were compromised were logged into from an IP address connected to an Internet provider in Doha, Qatar. The Qatari government has denied involvement.

But the Google capability won‚Äôt be immediately accessible when the TVs hit stores next month. Owners will have to wait for a firmware upgrade that Sony plans to deliver by the ‚Äúend of the year.‚Äù With Google Assistant, users will be able to tap a button on a microphone-equipped remote to control the TV and other devices using voice commands‚Äîor communicate with the TV via a Google Home speaker without pushing any buttons. Wired explained how Google Assistant will work on Sony TV‚Äôs: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre familiar with the way Assistant looks and sounds on a phone, a demo looked similar on Sony‚Äôs big screens. You hit a button on the remote, ask it things, and Assistant‚Äôs bubbly little bar appears on the bottom of the display. You‚Äôll be able to ask it general queries and control other devices in the Google Home universe, but the built-in Assistant will have a few TV-specific features. For example, you can change source inputs just by asking, launch apps on the TV, start playing a show just by asking for it, and adjust the volume and channel.‚Äù Log in or register to post comments COMMENTS Not New Submitted by brenro on February 14, 2017 - 10:03am Alexa can already do this through Logitech Harmony remotes.

It appears that the engineers were paid so much at Google, that they were eventually able to quit and start their own companies. According to Bloomberg, "Early staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded super-sized payouts based on the project's value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members didn't need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities." The unique pay system was started in 2010 when Google was just beginning to gain momentum by unveiling its first self-driving vehicle. It was devised so that employees would have an incentive and was based on the performance of the project. While this is not uncommon in many work environments, Google's would add in special multipliers that would kick in. Although the criteria to gain these multipliers are unknown, the self-driving program did well, resulting in employees with huge payments. This would eventually lead to staff departures with some moving to new start-ups and even starting their own self-driving technology companies. As time passes, the playing field will become increasingly competitive, and will surely become an interesting space to watch over the next few years.

Whether you are selling high-end investments, expensive cars, loans or clothes, targeting high-end individuals within AdWords will help you improve your return on investment. Today I am going to be showing you a deeply hidden gem within AdWords that allows you to target people based on their household income. It works using data from Google that is sourced from this AdWords Help post. ‚ÄúTarget locations by demographics to reach groups of people based on their location‚Äôs approximate average household income. Based on publicly available data from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), advertisers are able to target ads to certain areas according to their average household income. This feature is currently available for U.S. locations only.‚Äù You can target people by household incomes that are in: Top 10% 11-20% 21-30% 31-40% Lower 50% One of the issues however with targeting users by household income is that if you are using very granular targeting such as by city or zip code Google will respect this targeting over income targets. So for example if you are targeting the whole of the USA with a household income target and then you target New York with a bid modifier of 20% then Google would respect the bid modifier for New York over the modifier for high income targets. What percentage of traffic comes from each target bucket? Early reports of the percentage of traffic from each target bucket have been published by bloggers. You will see that on average, users in the top 10% will have an income of $146,001 per year, with the bottom 50% having an income of less than $64,000 per year. When looking at the percentage of clicks, 19.7% come from users with an average household income of $64,000 or less per year, with just 1.8% coming from households with an average income of $146,001 or more. How To Target High Net Worth Individuals in Adwords STEP 1. Go to your campaign settings along the top menu, and then select all settings from the sub menu as shown below. STEP 2. Within the targeting options go to advanced targeting as shown in the screenshot below. STEP 3. In the advanced settings menu select location groups and then from the drop down select ‚Äúdemographics‚Äù as shown below. STEP 4. Enter the location that you would like to target within the location box and then select the household income tier that you would like to target.

Top three programmatic trends in 2017 Nine crazy predictions for SEO in 2017 How to layer targeting methods to change bids If you have a product which people from lower income households are likely to purchase, but a larger majority of your customers will be higher net worth individuals, you may want to consider using layered targeting. For example, if I am targeting New York, I would add both New York as a location and then add New York (Top 10% by Income) as a location as shown below. You can then use bid modifiers to appear higher in Google‚Äôs results for higher net worth individuals. You can see in the example that bids would be increased by 10% for higher net worth individuals.¬† Conclusion There are countless industries where this deeply hidden targeting feature will be very effective at improving your Adwords performance. There are hundreds of different keywords that where the intention is dramatically changed when you compare the top 10% of earners with the bottom 50%. If you are targeting one of these markets, you should definitely¬†consider testing this strategy. If you have any questions about this feature please feel free to comment below with your questions.

SUBSCRIBE How ads on Google for its own products can impact the prices other advertisers pay Just as on a retail shelf, there are only so many ad spots available on a search result. Ginny Marvin on February 14, 2017 at 11:00 am More When Google and its sibling companies at Alphabet buy ads on its own search engine, the company says it works to ensure that its participation in the ad auction¬†doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdirectly inflate‚Äù what the other advertisers in that auction end up paying. The mechanics of those efforts can be hard to follow if you aren‚Äôt familiar with the AdRank system Google uses to decide which ads to show based on how much advertisers are willing to pay and the ‚Äúquality score‚Äù assigned to each ad.¬†Our story on Search Engine Land goes into those mechanics. But the bottom line is that despite Google trying to keep pricing neutral in the auction, just being in the auction can have an impact on its customers‚Äô prices. That‚Äôs because of what could be called the ‚Äúlimited shelf space‚Äù scenario. If Google were a store: a cereal scenario Consider Google as if it were a retailer selling cereal, with brands paying for shelf positioning. There is only so much room on the shelf. Here we‚Äôve got a¬†scenario in which there are spots for four boxes of cereal on the store shelf, and brands compete for shelf positioning. For simplicity‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs assume Google thinks every box is just as likely to appeal to customers and gives each brand the same ‚Äúquality score.‚Äù That score plus the price each brand is willing to pay to get on the shelf determines which brand gets the best position and the pricing. The¬†price each brand pays might look something like this: Position 1 ‚Äî¬† Brand A pays $0.50 per box Position 2 ‚Äî Brand B pays $0.45 per box Position 3 ‚Äî Brand C pays $0.40 per box Position 4 ‚Äî Brand D pays $0.35 per box Now, consider Google comes into the mix with its own in-house cereal brand. Google says its cereal will compete for positioning along with all the other brands. It aims to neutralize its affect on what the other brands pay by calculating their prices as if Google didn‚Äôt win a spot on the shelf. Things change as follows: Postiion 1 ‚Äì ¬†Brand A pays $0.50 Position 2 ‚Äì¬†Google pays $0.47 Position 3 ‚Äì Brand B pays $0.45 Position 4 ‚Äì Brand C pays $0.40 GONE ‚Äì Brand D pushed off the shelf Notice, the prices the three brands still left on the shelf pay haven‚Äôt changed, but Google‚Äôs entry means Brand D got pushed out entirely. Now, consider that next time Brand D is¬†willing to pay more in order to get back on that shelf. Google‚Äôs attempt to¬†take itself out of the pricing equation can‚Äôt eliminate the inevitable change in competition when there are now just three spots on the shelf for the other brands to vie for. This is what¬†can happen when Google runs its own ads in the AdWords auction. Google says advertiser prices aren‚Äôt affected because ‚Äúadvertisers are charged as if it wasn‚Äôt bidding.‚Äù That‚Äôs not quite the case. Its participation can force the other advertisers to jockey harder for the limited ad spots on the page¬†and increase the odds that at least one advertiser will pay more to maintain visibility. By the mechanics of AdWords pricing, bid changes by one (non-Google) advertiser can have a ripple effect on the prices other advertisers pay. One can argue Google shouldn‚Äôt take up space on its virtual ‚Äúshelf‚Äù at all. However, it‚Äôs also hard to argue that Alphabet companies like Nest shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to advertise its thermostats on Google, for example. Either way, there are steps Google could take to be clearer about its role and better inform its customers of steps it takes to address conflicts of interest.

Whether it is Jihadi videos on YouTube, anti-Semitic search suggestions, or other forms of extremist content freely available on one of its platforms, Google has to accept that extremists are exploiting the internet. Up until now, Google has been able to bat away criticism with relative ease, with little to no effective action taken. However it would appear that criticism is growing, and it must respond. Too often Google absolves itself of any responsibility. The search giant has always strived to be more than a for-profit entity. Rightly, it prides itself on its ability and its success in shaping modern life. And in doing so, it has become part of the fabric of society. Google is no longer viewed simply as a search engine market leader, and nor does it want to be. With this great status comes a heavy responsibility, one that, thus far, Google has failed to do justice to. We can't give extremists a free ride online. We wouldn't allow this offline, so why allow it online? It's right that the internet, and by extension Google, is a relatively ungoverned space. Silicon Valley has flourished under the current conditions. But we can't allow extremists to exploit the good nature of Silicon Valley. Research by the Centre on Religion & Geopolitics into the accessibility of Islamist extremist content on the Google search platform last year found that, rather worryingly, content ranging from the overtly violent magazines of Isis and al-Qaeda to the more subtle calls for killing apostates and Jews were ranking prominently in Google's search listings. In fact, the research found that there were almost half a million searches conducted every single month for phrases that return extremist content, 54,000 of which were from the UK alone. Similarly, journalist Carole Cadwalladr found that Google's own algorithm was suggesting anti-Semitic search phrases, on top of which anti-Semitic websites run by far-right extremists were the first websites that the searches were returning. Google recently gave itself a pat on the back in a blog post about how it had done a great job in cleaning its ad platform in order to "protect people from misleading, inappropriate, or harmful ads". In fact, the company said it developed an algorithm to systematically purge its platforms from almost 2 billion ads that violated its policies. While this may seem to be an admission of responsibility, ultimately Google has only acted on this because the revenue from advertisements is the core pillar of its financial model. There is a question to be asked: if Google can invest the time, money, and resources to tackling spurious ads that undermine its policies, why can't the company act against extremist content? The question of removing certain content from its listings always makes Google hot under the collar. Of course it doesn't want to be seen as policing the internet and what people can access, but in reality the company already does this. In Germany, legislation dictates that Google results omit anti-Semitic, Nazi content from its search listings, while in Europe more broadly, the Right to be Forgotten law requires the company to remove historic, inaccurate, and misleading listings about individuals should they request them to be removed. A collective, legislative approach to tackling extremist content online will circumnavigate the age-old debate about net-neutrality and compel the major tech players to play ball. The likelihood of upsetting Google might be high, but would it lead to Google withdrawing its business from such markets? Certainly not. Every so often Google, along with Twitter and Facebook, are hauled before ministers and committees in the US, the UK, Europe and elsewhere as the powers that be seek answers on what these corporations are doing to tackle extremist content. There are some colourful responses, ranging from empowering civil society to holding "hackathons" and workshops. This all sounds very good, but the same flaw underscores all of these initiatives; the power to act is handed from the tech companies to the public. There is no doubt that wider society has its role to play, but only Google, with its technological resources can make a sizable difference. Google's algorithm to root out bad adverts is billed as having done a job that would have taken 50 years to do if it was done manually. Surely, it could explore a similar approach to extremism of all kinds that find their way into our search results, whether it be racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or any other kind of hate speech. On the flipside, if Google fails to take action, are we looking at 50 years before this problem is solved? Actions speak louder than words, and in its own words Google understands the problem and remains committed to a "zero-tolerance policy for content that incites violence or hatred". Yet the actions that Google has thus far demonstrated show a real reluctance to engage with the issue. Whether it's mobile phones, homes, cars, or anything else that Google turns its attention to, the company strives to fundamentally change our lives for the better. However, being a change maker doesn't negate responsibility. In fact, when you become change makers, your responsibility grows. Executives at Google should go back to square one, understand what users are searching for, and understand what users are being presented with. We can't allow extremists a free ride online. There can be no ungoverned spaces when battling terrorists. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Credit: Magdalena Petrova More like this CloudVelox eases migration of core business apps to the cloud Here's how Evernote moved 3 petabytes of data to Google's cloud MySQL face-off: Amazon outscales Google Video Getting a bead on tech trends for 2017 Google has turned a database service that it uses to run some of its mission-critical products into an offering for its public cloud customers. On Tuesday, the company launched Cloud Spanner, a new fully managed database that‚Äôs supposed to provide the transactional consistency of a traditional database plus the scalability and performance of a NoSQL database. It‚Äôs based on the same systems that run the company‚Äôs own Spanner database internally. Usually, businesses have to pick either a traditional or a NoSQL database, and each comes with particular trade-offs. Traditional databases provide better transactional consistency, but can be hard to scale. NoSQL databases are better at scaling but sacrifice consistency. Cloud Spanner is designed to reduce those trade-offs, and it's also delivered as a fully managed service. Among other things, that means Google will manage hardware, software and replication of content for a database that can span multiple data centers. The service will be useful for companies that need millisecond-level consistency in their databases worldwide, according to Nick Heudecker, a research director at Gartner. In an interview, he called out financial services and advertising as two industries that might benefit from Cloud Spanner. Heudecker did point out that the service will require companies to port existing applications, which may prove challenging. Google is working with partners to help customers move over, according to Deepti Srivastava, the product manager for Cloud Spanner. Cloud Spanner has generated more interest than most new Google services, based on response to a closed alpha test, Srivastava said. Cloud Spanner grew out of a project that began in 2007, when a team of Google employees set out to solve the problem of choosing between NoSQL and traditional databases. That led to a paper, published in 2012, describing the company‚Äôs Spanner database, which uses a number of novel techniques, including atomic and GPS clocks inside data centers to maintain time consistency. Spanner is used to operate Google services like AdWords and Google Play. According to the company, it can handle tens of millions of queries per second. That pedigree is a feature of Cloud Spanner that appealed to Peter Bakkum, the platform lead at Quizlet. The education software company, which offers a popular set of study tools for students, is evaluating how to scale its database infrastructure. Quizlet has been testing Cloud Spanner since the closed alpha phase and may end up using the service to replace its existing setup of MySQL databases. Refactoring Quizlet‚Äôs applications to use Cloud Spanner will require work, but that's true of all the possible upgrade paths, Bakkum said. ‚ÄúWe need a fundamentally different architecture to do scaling, and any of those solutions have a difficult migration path,‚Äù he said. Cloud Spanner‚Äôs popularity may be throttled somewhat by Google‚Äôs position in the cloud market. While the company has been aggressive in releasing new capabilities and improving its services to attract new customers, its use still lags behind that of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Using Cloud Spanner means bringing data to Google‚Äôs cloud platform and building an application that targets it. While some companies are comfortable working with multiple cloud providers, not all of them are. That said, Gartner's Heudecker said Google is the only major cloud provider offering a product like this one and it will be hard for rivals to catch up. ‚ÄúCloud Spanner is not just software,‚Äù Heudecker said. ‚ÄúIt is the union of software, hardware ‚Äî in the form of atomic clocks in Google‚Äôs data centers ‚Äî and an incredibly robust network connecting their data centers together. So it‚Äôs not just writing code. It‚Äôs a lot of investment and a lot of operational expertise that Google excels at.‚Äù Right now, Cloud Spanner instances can only exist in one of Google's cloud regions, though they'll be replicated across multiple availability zones inside those regions. In the future, Cloud Spanner customers will be able to have one database that's kept in sync across multiple regions.¬† To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google today is announcing the launch of Cloud Spanner, a new managed database service that people can use through the Google Cloud Platform. The service is an implementation of the Spanner software that Google documented in a paper in 2012 and has been using internally for years. Google did something similar when it introduced Google Cloud Bigtable database service in 2015, nine years after the publication of the Bigtable paper. And before Bigtable, there was the 2014 launch of Google Container Engine, which is based on Google‚Äôs open-source Kubernetes container cluster management software. Among the things that distinguish Spanner from other databases, including Bigtable, are its support for the classic SQL query language, distributed transactions, and ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) compliance. ‚ÄúCloud Spanner keeps application development simple by supporting standard tools and languages in a familiar relational database environment. It‚Äôs ideal for operational workloads supported by traditional relational databases, including inventory management, financial transactions, and control systems, that are outgrowing those systems,‚Äù Google product manager Deepti Srivastava wrote in a blog post. Google Cloud Platform continues to field the Google Cloud SQL Service, as well as Google Cloud Datastore. But now customers will be able to use the same software that Google uses to power Google Play and AdWords. Public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers the MySQL-compatible Aurora relational database, as well as the Relational Database Service (RDS). Microsoft Azure offers Azure SQL Database, as well as SQL Server on virtual machines (VMs). ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy ¬© 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Google unveiled a special surprise for Web surfers this Valentine's Day eve. The Web giant has a new Valentine's Day-themed doodle game aimed at bringing awareness to the plight of the pangolins, the world's most poached and trafficked mammal. "This Valentine's Day, we're telling the tale of two long-distance loves who have been struck by Cupid's arrow," Jordan Thompson, a software engineer on the Google Doodle team, wrote in a blog post. "Writing love letters to each other from far-off places, these pangolins know in their hearts that they're scaly soulmates. What better day to meet for their first date than the most romantic day of the year?" Looking to zone out for a while? Head over to Google.com to play the doodle game on the desktop or your mobile device. As you go through the game, you'll have to pick up different items to rack up points, and earn as many stars as possible. You can click the heart icon in the main menu to learn more about the pangolins and donate to support the World Wildlife Fund's conservation efforts. First, your little rolling pangolin will travel to Ghana to meet a friend who "teaches the fine art of making chocolate cake," Thompson wrote. Next, the pangolin visits India "where its musical pal shows how to construct a lovely melody that's sure to touch the heart of its beloved." From there, the pangolin sets out for China, where it learns to dance before embarking on its final ques to the Philippines. There, the pangolin will learn to build a flower bouquet to win the hart of its love. "Once our pangolin heroes have found their hearts' desire, show your own Valentine they're the king or queen of hearts by sharing your score when the game is complete," Thompson wrote. "After all, Valentine's festivities are always sweeter when they're shared!" Back to top Previous : Online Stores May Know Your New Card Details Before You Do Do You 'Netflix Cheat'?

Mobile wallets are moving to dashboards as automakers partner with card networks and retailers to equip vehicles with in-car payment technology. Drivers will be able to pay for parking spaces and gasoline without even getting out of their cars. Meanwhile, tech firms such as Amazon and Google are bringing their popular voice assistants to cars, providing consumers a way to buy products while they‚Äôre behind the wheel. In-car purchasing could be a bonanza for retailers and merchants, and a convenient shopping experience for consumers. Cardholders could also see new retailer discounts and opportunities to earn rewards and loyalty points as they shop inside their cars. ¬† Visa and Honda recently demonstrated a system that will allow drivers to pay for parking and gas inside their vehicles. ¬† Ford Motor Co. will soon add Amazon‚Äôs Alexa voice assistant to its vehicles. Visa and Honda recently demonstrated a system that will allow drivers to pay for parking and gas inside their vehicles. ¬† Ford Motor Co. will soon add Amazon‚Äôs Alexa voice assistant to its vehicles. ‚ÄúThis is an exciting area of innovation ‚Äì the opportunity of what role will the vehicle have within everyday commerce experiences,‚Äù said Rich Meszaros, connected commerce lead at Accenture Mobility. However, some experts are concerned that the ability to shop while you drive could pose safety risks and encourage overspending. Start your engines The trend toward in-car payment systems started up last year and has accelerated in 2017. Last October, Mastercard announced a partnership with General Motors and IBM to bring mobile payments to OnStar systems in GM vehicle dashboards. Visa and Honda in January demonstrated a new in-vehicle payments system they‚Äôve been working on in collaboration with smart parking meter and gas pump manufacturers. Honda drivers will be alerted when they pull up to a beacon-equipped smart meter or fuel pump, and they can pay just by touching a button on the dash. Ford Motor Co. recently proclaimed itself the first car manufacturer to add Amazon‚Äôs Alexa digital voice assistant to its vehicles. Ford said in a January press release the first phase of its Alexa integration would allow users to connect to their cars from inside their houses to their Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap devices. You can start your car‚Äôs engine, check the fuel level, lock or unlock the doors and even gauge the battery life just by chatting with Alexa. This summer, users will be able to talk to Alexa from inside their cars, enabling them to check the weather, edit their shopping lists and even buy stuff while driving. Drivers will be able to order any item available via Amazon Prime in their Alexa-equipped cars, and the voice assistant will make product recommendations based on order history. John Scumniotales, general manager at Amazon Alexa Automotive, noted that users will also be able to order food from Amazon Restaurants and Pizza Hut and send flowers from 1-800-FLOWERS using Alexa‚Äôs ‚Äúskills.‚Äù Skills are similar to chatbots in that they allow customers to interact with individual retailers, merchants, banks and other service providers via artificial intelligence. Of course, chatbots lack the personal touch of a human-sounding assistant like Alexa or Apple‚Äôs Siri, and they can‚Äôt be used while driving. ‚ÄúWe believe voice is the future,‚Äù Scumniotales said. ‚ÄúIt will fundamentally improve the way people interact with their car.‚Äù We believe voice is the future. It will fundamentally improve the way people interact with their car. ‚Äî John Scumniotales General Manager, Amazon Alexa Automotive Not to be outdone, Google is working with Hyundai to bring its Google Assistant to the South Korean automaker‚Äôs cars. Google‚Äôs voice assistant does not yet allow payments, but the tech firm is rumored to be developing that capability. European car manufacturers are getting into the mobile payments game as well. Volkswagen in December acquired parking payment app PayByPhone and Luxembourg-based Daimler last month announced it bought digital payments processor PayCash Europe. Smart driving Paying for parking or fuel at your dashboard can save time, energy and discomfort. For example, a driver living in a cold climate can stay a little warmer by starting a fuel transaction in the warmth of his car‚Äôs interior instead of getting out and fumbling with his credit or debit card at the pump or meter. Meszaros of Accenture said further advancements could enable drivers to pay tolls, buy on-demand insurance while inside a rental vehicle or order food while outside a restaurant that has no drive-through window. Meanwhile, interactions between cars and smart parking meters could help drivers better navigate high-traffic situations, such as sporting events. ‚ÄúWhen you think about the bottlenecks in attending one of those events, it‚Äôs often parking,‚Äù Meszaros said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs contributing to that bottleneck is paying for it. If your vehicle could seamlessly pay as you‚Äôre entering or exiting by communicating from the car directly to the parking lot, that would be a great experience for attendees.‚Äù Paying for gas remotely can also help protect consumers from fraud and identity theft. Experts say credit card skimming at gas pumps is on the rise, and fuel stations were recently granted an extra three years to adopt security-enhancing EMV-enabled payments. In-car payment doesn‚Äôt solve all security issues related to gas pump transactions, but it‚Äôs a key step. ‚ÄúWe need to think about the entire life cycle of the security of that payment,‚Äù Meszaros said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs everything from how do the payment credentials get into the vehicle to how they‚Äôre stored and how they‚Äôre transacted with the smart device outside the vehicle ‚Äì whether they use tokenization or other techniques.‚Äù Drivers could also save money on online purchases if in-car payments are integrated with reward and loyalty point programs. Mobile wallet providers, such as Samsung, are using their own rewards systems to encourage more consumers to pay with their phones. Rewards specific to in-vehicle payments have yet to materialize, but Meszaros said they are the ‚Äúnext likely step.‚Äù¬† Keep your eyes on the road ‚Äì and your card balance Adding a payment system or voice assistant to a car‚Äôs dashboard raises a safety concern that has loomed large in the smartphone era ‚Äì distracted driving. Researchers at the University of Utah found in an October 2015 study that drivers needed up to 27 seconds to regain full attention after issuing commands to voice assistants. A driver traveling at 25 miles per hour would cover the length of three football fields during that time, researchers said. The study‚Äôs subjects used Microsoft‚Äôs Cortana, Apple‚Äôs Siri and Google Now on smartphones and onboard infotainment systems offered by major automakers. The potential risks extend beyond personal safety. Some experts think an in-car voice assistant that takes orders and encourages more spending could negatively affect consumers who are prone to shopping addiction. The impact of in-car voice assistants is not yet known, but the ease of online purchasing can encourage overspending. Terrence Shulman, founder of the Shulman Center for Theft, Spending and Hoarding, said about 10 percent of Americans struggle with compulsive spending at some point in their lives. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not against anybody buying whatever he or she wants, but it‚Äôs no secret that people are getting more impulsive and impatient,‚Äù Shulman said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs less time to consider a purchase because things are so easy.‚Äù Cars and credit already require caution In-car payments could revolutionize the way we travel and shop, but any exciting technological advancement has potential downsides. Shopping with credit cards and driving are two tasks that already require mindfulness and restraint. Consumers will win if dashboard payment systems don‚Äôt encourage us to let our guard down behind the wheel.

Google hasn't denied that it used Java software in Android, but it has maintained that it did so without violating any intellectual property laws. Last year, a court found that Google's use of Java APIs in Android constituted "fair use", which the company hailed as "a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products." Unsurprisingly, Oracle was rather less convinced by that ruling, insisting that Google had "developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market". It vowed "to bring this case back to the Federal Circuit on appeal." True to its word, Oracle has now done exactly that, filing with the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday, seeking to overturn last year's 'fair use' jury verdict. In its filing, Oracle referred to the integration of its Java APIs by Google as "classic unfair use". Last July, it referred to case law claiming that where a company "exclusively acquires conspicuous financial rewards" from the use of another company's IP, fair use considerations do not apply. Oracle said in its 155-page appeal on Friday that "Google reaped billions of dollars while leaving Oracle's Java business in tatters."

The highly innovative tech giant is always trying its hands on anything capable of keeping its users asking for more. This time around, the tech giant is rolling out a shareable lists feature to its popular Maps app. On Monday, Google announced that one of its popular features on Google Maps, important places, will be expanded to make the app work and feel more like social. The company made this known in a blog post on Monday. In the post, Google said the new shareable feature will let users to save locations to a number of lists and then share them with friends and family directly within the Maps app. ‚ÄúStarting today, you can create lists of places, share your lists with others, and follow the lists your friends and family share with you‚Äîwithout ever leaving the Google Maps app (Android, iOS),‚Äù Google said in a blog post on Monday. Getting started: To get started, all you have to do is open the Google Maps app and find any of your favorite spot. By simply tapping on the place name, the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù icon adds the place to one of several pre-set lists like ‚ÄúWant to Go‚Äù or ‚ÄúFavorites.‚Äù Using a BBQ spot as an example, Google said it you can add your favorite restaurant to a ‚Äúnew list that you name yourself, like ‚ÄúFinger Lickin‚Äô BBQ.‚Äù To recall the lists you‚Äôve created, go to Your Places (in the side menu) and then open the saved tab. Icons for the places you‚Äôve saved to lists will appear on the map itself, so you‚Äôll always know whether one of your must-try BBQ spots is nearby.‚Äù You can share your favorite spots across different social networks, popular messaging apps, email, and via text messages. The new feature offers a lot of fun‚Äîand as a matter of fact, ‚Äúyou can tap the share button to get a link and start flexing your local knowledge muscles‚Äù when your friends and families come into town. As soon as a link is sent out to your friends and families, they can tap ‚ÄúFollow‚Äù to pull up the list from Your Places whenever they need. Below is a shot video clip explaining how the new feature works in real life, according to Google: Now wait for this; every list you follow using the feature goes with you everywhere you take the Google Maps app to, and can also be viewed on mobile and desktop, as well as offline. You can even plan ahead of your next trip by downloading offline maps of the area in advance. This enables you to see all the places that have been added by you on the map. Saved locations in the list will appear on the map when you as long as you keep using Google Maps. The new feature is rolling out to all users today. However, you will only be able to make lists on Google‚Äôs mobile apps for iOS and Android.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 02.14.17. 02.14.17 Time of Publication: 12:00 pm. 12:00 pm Spanner, the Google Database That Mastered Time, Is Now Open to Everyone Getty Images About a decade ago, a handful of Google‚Äôs most talented engineers started building a system that seems to defy logic. Called Spanner, it was the first global database, a way of storing information across millions of machines in dozens of data centers spanning multiple continents, and it now underpins everything from Gmail to AdWords, the company‚Äôs primary moneymaker. But it‚Äôs not just the size of this creation that boggles the mind. The real trick is that, even though Spanner stretches across the globe, it behaves as if it‚Äôs in one place. Google can change company data in one part of this database‚Äîrunning an ad, say, or debiting an advertiser‚Äôs account‚Äîwithout contradicting changes made on the other side of the planet. What‚Äôs more, it can readily and reliably replicate data across multiple data centers in multiple parts of the world‚Äîand seamlessly retrieve these copies if any one data center goes down. For a truly global business like Google, such transcontinental consistency is enormously powerful. Related Stories Cade Metz The Epic Story of Dropbox‚Äôs Exodus From the Amazon Cloud Empire Cade Metz Dell. EMC. HP. Cisco. These Tech Giants Are the Walking Dead Klint Finley Google‚Äôs Cloud Investments are Finally Starting to Pay Off Before Spanner, this didn‚Äôt seem possible. Machines couldn‚Äôt keep databases consistent without constant and heavy communication, and communication across the globe took much too long. You know, the speed of light and all that. Google‚Äôs engineers needed something like the the ansible, a fictional device that first appeared in Ursula Le Guin‚Äôs 1966 novel Rocannon‚Äôs World and became a sci-fi trope. The ansible can instantly send information across any distance, defying both time and space. Spanner isn‚Äôt the ansible. It can‚Äôt shrink space. But it works because those engineers found a way to harness time. No one else has ever built a system like this. No one else has taken hold of time in the same way. And now Google is offering this technology to the rest of the world as a cloud computing service. Google believes this can provide some added leverage in its battle with Microsoft and Amazon for supremacy in the increasingly important cloud computing market, just because Spanner is unique. And some agree. ‚ÄúIf they offer it, people will want it, and people will use it,‚Äù says Peter Bailis, an assistant professor of computer science at Stanford University who specializes in massively distributed software systems. But as others point out: Few businesses have the same needs as Google. Trusting Time In the past, if you built a system that spanned hundreds of machines and multiple data centers, you followed an important rule: Don‚Äôt trust time. If a system involved communication between many machines in many different places, time would vary from machine to machine, just because time‚Äîprecise time‚Äîis a hard thing to keep. Services like the Network Time Protocol aimed to provide machines with a common reference point. But this worked only so well, mainly because networks are slow. It takes time to send the time. For Google, this was a problem. If a database spanned multiple regions, it couldn‚Äôt ensure that transactions in one part of the world lined up with transactions in another. It couldn‚Äôt get a truly global picture of its operations. It couldn‚Äôt seamlessly replicate data cross regions or quickly retrieve replicated data when it was needed. So Google‚Äôs top engineers found a way to trust time. Related Video Game of Clouds: Dropbox Declares Independence From Amazon Part of the trick is that they equipped Google‚Äôs data centers with a series of GPS receivers and atomic clocks. The GPS receivers, much like the one in your cell phone, grab the time from various satellites orbiting the globe, while the atomic clocks keep their own time. Then they shuttle their time readings to master servers in each data center. These masters constantly trade readings in an effort to settle on a common time. A margin of error still exists, but thanks to so many readings, the masters can bootstrap a far more reliable timekeeping service. ‚ÄúThis gives you faster-than-light coordination between two places,‚Äù says Peter Mattis, a former Google engineer who founded CockroachDB, a startup working to build an open source version of Spanner. Google calls this timekeeping technology TrueTime, and only Google has it. Drawing on a celebrated research paper Google released in 2012, Mattis and CockroachDB have duplicated many other parts of Spanner‚Äîbut not TrueTime. Google can pull this off only because of its massive global infrastructure. A Changing World To be sure, a few others could build a similar service, namely Amazon and Microsoft. But they haven‚Äôt yet. With help from TrueTime, Spanner has provided Google with a competitive advantage in so many different markets. It underpins not only AdWords and Gmail but more than 2,000 other Google services, including Google Photos and the Google Play store. Google gained the ability to juggle online transactions at an unprecedented scale, and thanks to Spanner‚Äôs extreme form of data replication, it was able to keep its services up and running with unprecedented consistency. Now Google wants a different kind of competitive advantage in the cloud computing market. It hopes to convince customers that Spanner provides an easier way of running a global business, a easier way of replicating their data across multiple regions and, thus, guard against outages. The rub is that few businesses are truly global. But Google is betting its new service will give customers the freedom to expand as time goes on. Among them is JDA, a company that helps businesses oversee their supply chains, which is now testing Spanner. ‚ÄúThe volume of data‚Äîand velocity with which that data is coming at us‚Äîis amplifying significantly,‚Äù says JDA group vice president John Sarvari. Spanner could also be useful in the financial markets, allowing big banks to more efficiently track and synchronize trades happening across the planet. And Google says it‚Äôs already in talks with large financial institutions about this kind of thing. Traditionally, many banks were wary of handling trades in the cloud for reasons of security and privacy. But those attitudes are softening. A few years ago, Spanner was something only Google needed. Now, Google is banking on change. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Amazon cloud databases google microsoft Spanner Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The announcement came Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live.‚Äù (Mitch Haaseth/ABC via AP) NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî NBC's comedy institution "Saturday Night Live" reached its largest audience since 2011 with last weekend's episode hosted by President Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin and featuring the return of Melissa McCarthy portraying White House press secretary Sean Spicer. The show reached 10.8 million viewers, the Nielsen company said. To put that in perspective, the late-night show had a bigger audience than all but four prime-time programs on TV last week. Among younger viewers, only the Grammys had better ratings. The viewership estimate is only a portion of their audience; it doesn't count millions of people who recorded the program for later viewing or watched clips of its skits online. McCarthy opened Saturday's show with her Spicer portrayal and Baldwin, who has been host for a show-record 17 times, rolled out his version of Trump appearing on "People's Court." Kate McKinnon also did an impersonation of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway in a "Fatal Attraction" type relationship with CNN's Jake Tapper; she also impersonated Jeff Sessions and Elizabeth Warren. It was the most-watched episode of "SNL" since Jan. 8, 2011, a show that featured Jim Carrey and the Black Keys. "SNL" ratings generally jump during election years and fade ‚Äî but interest in the Trump administration has kept the numbers high. Celebrities condemn Texas 'bathroom bill' AUSTIN, Texas (AP) ‚Äî Musicians Lady Gaga and Alicia Keys along with Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence are among more than 140 artists and celebrities condemning a Texas "bathroom bill" targeting transgender people. Britney Spears and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel also signed a letter Tuesday criticizing the Republican-backed efforts as a "denial of basic human dignity." The bill would require people to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate. It's similar to a North Carolina law that prompted rockers Pearl Jam and Bruce Springsteen to cancel concerts in that state last year. The Texas bill has yet to receive even a preliminary vote but public pressure is ratcheting up. Last week, the NFL suggested that Texas could be passed over for future Super Bowl sites if the proposal became law. Atlanta zoo names cockroach after Patriots' Tom Brady More than a week after the Falcons fell victim to the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history, an Atlanta zoo has named a cockroach after Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Zoo Atlanta says on its Facebook page that it had a bet with Rhode Island's Roger Williams Park Zoo that called for the loser to name a baby animal after the winning team's star quarterback. Both zoos figured the loser would be pretty bitter about the game, so they agreed the animal in question would be a Madagascar hissing cockroach. The zoo introduced a whole family of cockroaches in a video Monday , including a tiny Tom Brady. Brady and the Patriots came back from a 25-point deficit to defeat Atlanta 34-28 in overtime to win the team's fifth Super Bowl title. Disney cuts ties with PewDiePie over anti-Semitic stunt Disney's Maker Studios and Google's YouTube are distancing themselves from a top YouTube star after he made jokes construed as anti-Semitic and posted Nazi imagery in his videos. Felix Kjellberg, known online as PewDiePie, has the most popular YouTube channel, with more than 53 million subscribers. The Swedish YouTube star rose to fame by posting videos of him playing and commenting about video games. More recently, he branched out into non-gaming videos that show him performing skits, stunts or making jokes. Disney, whose Maker Studios runs Kjellberg's channels and network, said he crossed the line with some of his videos. One video from January shows two Indian men paid by Kjellberg to hold up a sign that says "Death to all Jews." Kjellberg said the video was meant to demonstrate how far people will go if they get paid to do something, but he didn't think they would actually do it. Other videos show Nazi imagery in a satirical way. In blog post Kjellberg said he was making jokes, but realizes now that they were offensive. Kjellberg's channel was already part of Maker Studios when the Walt Disney Co. bought Maker in 2014 for $675 million. Maker contracts with individuals such as Kjellberg to produce videos for various YouTube channels. Kjellberg pulled the video showing the two men displaying the anti-Semitic sign, but it is excerpted in a Wall Street Journal video. Other videos still on the site show Nazi imagery being used satirically. Maker Studios said in a statement that while Kjellberg's channel is popular because he is irreverent and provocative, the studio is ending its affiliation with him because he went too far. YouTube spokeswoman Michelle Slavich said YouTube has canceled the release of the second season of Kjellberg's reality show "Scare PewDiePie" and removed the PewDiePie channel from its Google Preferred advertising program, which aggregates top YouTube content for advertisers to buy time on. Downey Jr., Linklater to make film based on podcast Richard Linklater and Robert Downey Jr. are teaming up to make a film adapted from a podcast. Megan Ellison's Annapurna Pictures announced Monday evening that it will produce the untitled film, with Linklater directing and Downey Jr. starring. It will be based on the episode "Man of the People" from the Reply All podcast. The episode, which aired in January, chronicles the true story of a doctor who scammed his way to fame and fortune, and the doctor who brought him down. Downey Jr. previously starred in Linklater's animated "A Scanner Darkly." The new film will be a break from Downey's Iron Man duties, which include the upcoming "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and next year's "Avenger's Infinity War." Linklater is also prepping "The Last Flag Flying" with Steve Carell and Bryan Cranston. London to screen Iranian Oscar nominee in message to Trump London's mayor says the British capital will hold a free outdoor screening of an Academy Award-nominated Iranian film whose director scrapped plans to attend the Oscars because of President Donald Trump's travel ban. Mayor Sadiq Khan said Tuesday that Asghar Farhadi's "The Salesman" will play in Trafalgar Square on Oscars day, Feb. 26, to celebrate London "as an international hub of creativity and as a beacon of diversity." "The Salesman" is nominated for best foreign-language film. After Trump temporarily barred citizens of Iran and six other majority Muslim nations last month, Farhadi said he would not attend the ceremony even if an exception were made. The ban has since been suspended by U.S. courts. Farhadi calls the London screening "a symbol of unity against the division and separation of people." ABC names first black "Bachelorette" LOS ANGELES (AP) ‚Äî ABC has named a black woman as its "Bachelorette" for the first time in the show's history. Rachel Lindsay will lead the 13th season of "The Bachelor" spinoff. The announcement came Monday night on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live." The news is somewhat of a spoiler for fans of the ongoing season of "The Bachelor." The 31-year-old attorney from Texas has yet to be eliminated from the dating show, where she is competing for the affections of Nick Viall. Nevertheless, Lindsay told Kimmel on Monday that she's ready to find love and a husband. She also encouraged the audience to send any interested suitors to apply for the show. "The Bachelorette" begins airing on ABC in May. Appellate court takes up 'Making a Murderer' inmate's case CHICAGO (AP) ‚Äî A federal appeals court will consider the fate of a Wisconsin inmate featured in the Netflix series "Making a Murderer." Brendan Dassey was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier. Dassey told detectives he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape and kill Halbach in the Avery family's Manitowoc County salvage yard. A federal magistrate judge overturned Dassey's conviction in August. He ruled that investigators took advantage of Dassey's youth ‚Äî he was 16 at the time ‚Äî and cognitive problems to coerce his confession. The state of Wisconsin argues that detectives did nothing wrong. Dassey, now 27, has remained in prison pending the appeal. Avery was sentenced to life in prison in a separate trial. He's pursuing his own appeal. MTV's European music awards headed to London in November LONDON (AP) ‚Äî MTV's Europe Music Awards are headed to London. The music broadcaster announced Tuesday that the 2017 edition of the EMAs will be held on Nov. 12 at the city's Wembley Arena. David Lynn, chief executive of MTV parent Viacom, says London is "arguably the world's musical epicenter" and the buzz of the awards will be "amplified tenfold" in the British capital. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says London is "the entertainment capital of the world" ‚Äî a status he wants it to retain when Britain leaves the European Union. The EMAs take place in a different European city each year and were last held in London in 1996. Last year's ceremony was in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. Winners of the awards are selected by fans across the continent. Former wrestling executive Linda McMahon on track to SBA The Senate has confirmed former wrestling entertainment executive Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration. The vote was 81-19 on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky says McMahon will "prioritize growing jobs over growing government bureaucracy" and calls that a welcome change from Washington. McMahon served as the chief executive officer at World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. before stepping down to run twice for the Senate in Connecticut. She lost both races despite spending some $100 million. The two Democrats who defeated her ‚Äî Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy ‚Äî backed her nomination to lead the Small Business Administration. McMahon helped WWE grow from about a dozen employees into an enterprise with more than 800.

On Tuesday, the company launched Cloud Spanner, a new, fully managed database that‚Äôs supposed to provide the transactional consistency of a traditional database plus the scalability and performance of a NoSQL database. It‚Äôs based on the same systems that run the company‚Äôs own Spanner database internally. Usually, businesses have to pick either a traditional or a NoSQL database, and each comes with particular trade-offs. Traditional databases provide better transactional consistency, but can be hard to scale. NoSQL databases are better at scaling but sacrifice consistency. Cloud Spanner is designed to reduce those trade-offs, and it's also delivered as a fully managed service. Among other things, that means Google will manage hardware, software and replication of content for a database that can span multiple data centers. The service will be useful for companies that need millisecond-level consistency in their databases worldwide, according to Nick Heudecker, a research director at Gartner. In an interview, he called out financial services and advertising as two industries that might benefit from Cloud Spanner. Heudecker did point out that the service will require companies to port existing applications, which may prove challenging. Google is working with partners to help customers move over, according to Deepti Srivastava, the product manager for Cloud Spanner. Cloud Spanner has generated more interest than most new Google services, based on response to a closed alpha test, Srivastava said. Cloud Spanner grew out of a project that began in 2007, when a team of Google employees set out to solve the problem of choosing between NoSQL and traditional databases. That led to a paper, published in 2012, describing the company‚Äôs Spanner database, which uses a number of novel techniques, including atomic and GPS clocks inside data centers to maintain time consistency. Spanner is used to operate Google services like AdWords and Google Play. According to the company, it can handle tens of millions of queries per second. That pedigree is a feature of Cloud Spanner that appealed to Peter Bakkum, the platform lead at Quizlet. The education software company, which offers a popular set of study tools for students, is evaluating how to scale its database infrastructure. Quizlet has been testing Cloud Spanner since the closed alpha phase and may end up using the service to replace its existing setup of MySQL databases. Refactoring Quizlet‚Äôs applications to use Cloud Spanner will require work, but that's true of all the possible upgrade paths, Bakkum said. ‚ÄúWe need a fundamentally different architecture to do scaling, and any of those solutions have a difficult migration path,‚Äù he said. Cloud Spanner‚Äôs popularity may be throttled somewhat by Google‚Äôs position in the cloud market. While the company has been aggressive in releasing new capabilities and improving its services to attract new customers, its use still lags behind that of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Using Cloud Spanner means bringing data to Google‚Äôs cloud platform and building an application that targets it. While some companies are comfortable working with multiple cloud providers, not all of them are. That said, Gartner's Heudecker said Google is the only major cloud provider offering a product like this one and it will be hard for rivals to catch up. ‚ÄúCloud Spanner is not just software,‚Äù Heudecker said. ‚ÄúIt is the union of software, hardware ‚Äî in the form of atomic clocks in Google‚Äôs data centers ‚Äî and an incredibly robust network connecting their data centers together. So it‚Äôs not just writing code. It‚Äôs a lot of investment and a lot of operational expertise that Google excels at.‚Äù Right now, Cloud Spanner instances can only exist in one of Google's cloud regions, though they'll be replicated across multiple availability zones inside those regions. In the future, Cloud Spanner customers will be able to have one database that's kept in sync across multiple regions. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

That was the assumption behind BeyondCorp, a new model for network security that Google proposed back in 2014, and it‚Äôs one that‚Äôs starting to get some attention from networking and security vendors. Enterprises have moved beyond the traditional workspace in recent years, allowing employees to work remotely by using their personal devices and accessing apps in private or public clouds. To bring roaming workers back into the fold, under the security blanket of their local networks, companies rely on VPNs and endpoint software to enforce network access controls. Google's¬†BeyondCorp¬†approach to enterprise security takes the focus away from the network perimeter and puts it on devices and users. It doesn't assign higher or lower levels of trust to devices based on whether they're inside the internal network or not. Some security vendors have already started to embrace this no-trust-by-default security model. Duo Security, a two-factor authentication provider, launched its own BeyondCorp-inspired offering last week, and enterprise software startup¬†ScaleFT has had dynamic access management service based on the same principles for a while. [ Further reading: When it comes to security, trust but verify ] Even networking and security appliance manufacturers like Cisco Systems have begun moving what were traditionally perimeter security gateways into the cloud to better serve roaming employees. Duo Security's new Duo Beyond service consists of a software package that serves as an authentication gateway for all of a company's web-based applications, whether they're hosted inside the local network or in the cloud. It can be deployed in the company network's demilitarized zone (DMZ) and provides a single sign-on service that enforces device and user-based access policies. Duo Beyond assumes a zero-trust environment for all devices by default, regardless of whether they're connecting from within the enterprise network or from the outside. That said, it does provide administrators with the ability to differentiate between corporate devices and personal devices by deploying Duo certificates to those that are managed by the company. This device identification process has several benefits. It allows for the easy discovery of new devices that are used to access corporate applications, which helps companies create and maintain accurate inventories that include employees' personal devices. It also allows restricting access to certain applications or accounts to company-managed devices where a certain degree of security can be guaranteed. The service can also check the security state of a connecting device by looking at whether it's running the latest OS and browser version, whether the browser plug-ins are up to date and, in the case of mobile devices, whether encryption and passcode enforcement are turned on. This allows administrators to create fine-grained access rules based on device "health" and ensure that only reasonably secure devices can access company applications, even if those devices are owned and managed by the employees themselves. Duo Security doesn't expect customers to completely give up on VPNs if they deploy Duo Beyond, but based on the company's experience so far, customers can cut down VPN licensing costs by up to 80 percent. That's because most roaming employees only use VPN connections to access a few popular intranet web applications like Confluence, Jira or Sharepoint. The Duo Beyond service is priced at $9 per user per month and includes everything in the company's older Duo Access service, plus the new certificate-based device identification and the mechanism for controlling which internal apps are accessible by remote users. Moving towards a BeyondCorp security model, where the location of devices does not matter, can help companies avoid having to raise virtual walls inside their networks. Network segmentation, which relies on setting up firewalls and VLANs to restrict access to certain applications and services, is not easy to implement and can quickly become an administrative burden. In fact, as evidenced by many publicly documented security breaches, attackers often succeed in moving laterally inside a network once they break in. Most hackers start with targeting low-level employees through phishing or other methods and then, once inside a network, jump from system to system, exploiting vulnerabilities and stealing access credentials along the way until they reach the organization's crown jewels. Google's own network was breached in late 2009 as part of a cyberespionage campaign of Chinese origin known as Operation Aurora. The hackers, who started by targeting the company's employees, sought access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists. Other security vendors are embracing BeyondCorp too, and, while there are differences in the implementation, the general goal is the same: Moving security beyond a strictly defined network perimeter. Duo Beyond works only for web-based applications, and its device insight technology is agentless. The information about a laptop's OS, browser and plug-ins is obtained through the browser itself. This approach limits what kind of information can be gathered, but Duo believes that it strikes the right balance between security and usability, since convincing users to install company-mandated software on their personal devices can be problematic. By comparison, another company called ScaleFT provides a BeyondCorp-inspired solution called Dynamic Access Management that works for SSH (Secure Shell) and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), remote access protocols for Linux and Windows servers. ScaleFT's service does requires the installation of client software that synchronizes short-lived access certificates and handles device enrolment and local account creation. Pushed by the need to address the issue of roaming employees, BYOD and software-as-a-service, some networking vendors have even started to move security appliances outside the network perimeter and into the cloud. On Monday, Cisco Systems announced what it calls the first Secure Internet Gateway (SIG), which is based on the cloud-based OpenDNS Umbrella service that the company acquired in 2015. "A SIG provides safe access to the internet anywhere users go, even when they are off the VPN," Cisco said in a blog post. "Before you connect to any destination, a SIG acts as your secure onramp to the internet and provides the first line of defense and inspection. Regardless of where users are located or what they‚Äôre trying to connect to, traffic goes through the SIG first." If this new way of thinking of enterprise security catches on it might even help speed up the adoption of IPv6, which is held back partly by fears that it could punch holes through network perimeters and because many companies still have old firewalls and equipment that don't have proper support for it.

The artificial intelligence company is founded by the former leaders of the self-driving car teams of Google and Uber, and will include roboticists and engineers developing a new software platform (with potential for licensing) for Ford's fully autonomous vehicle, coming in 2021. Bryan Salesky, ex-Google and Argo AI CEO, and Peter Rander, ex-Uber and Argo AI and both are alumni of Carnegie Mellon National Robotics Engineering Center. Ford President and CEO Mark Fields said of the announcement "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago." "As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford‚Äôs leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The current team developing Ford's virtual driver system ‚Äì the machine-learning software that acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles ‚Äì will be working with the team from Argo AI, creating the virtual driver system for Ford's SAE level 4 self-driving vehicles scheduled for release in 2021. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," Salesky said in a statement. "We are energized by Ford's commitment and vision for the future of mobility, and we believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." Ford's executive vice president of Global Product Development, chief technical officer Raj Nair said "Working together with Argo AI gives Ford a distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the automotive and technology industries. "This open collaboration is unlike any other partnership ‚Äì allowing us to benefit from combining the speed of a startup with Ford's strengths in scaling technology, systems integration and vehicle design." Ford Smart Mobility LLC will lead on the commercialisation strategy for Ford's self-driving vehicles, including choices for using autonomous vehicles to move goods and people, such as ride sharing, ride hailing or package delivery fleets. Ford will be the majority stakeholder in Argo AI, but the company says that Argo AI "has been structured to operate with substantial independence". "Its employees will have significant equity participation in the company, enabling them to share in its success," Ford said in a statement. "By the end of this year, Argo AI expects to have more than 200 team members, based in the company's Pittsburgh headquarters and at major sites in Southeastern Michigan and the Bay Area of California."

The feature was mentioned by a Google project member in an official developer forum. In a discussion thread regarding multiuser functionality in Android handsets, the Google employee posted the following reply to forum members: ‚ÄúThe development team has implemented this feature and it will be available as a part of the next public build.‚Äù Although the statement isn‚Äôt exactly specific, but ‚Äúthe next public build‚Äù refers to Android L, unless Google is planning to introduce the feature in another minor KitKat update, which seems unlikely.¬†Already available on Android tablets, the multi-user feature will surely make owners of Android smartphones a tad less wary of leaving their devices to others, especially children. It would also be useful to small businesses who want to create separate accounts for their office and home without investing in enterprise-managed mobile devices. Google introduced Android L at this year‚Äôs Google I/O. Google has already made the developer preview available. As of now the update is available only for the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7. According to reports Moto X and G will be first in line getting Android L updates. Android L is expected to be launched later this year, although no clear date has been mentioned yet. Motorola vice president of product management Punit Soni recently responded to a Google+ query on the smartphone receiving the L update. ‚ÄúMoto X is still going to get Android L (5.0) right?,‚Äù asked a user, to which Punit Soni simply responded, ‚ÄúYup‚Äù. likethis What's your reaction?

¬† SOFTPEDIA¬Æ DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Mobile World FLASH SALE: VDownloader ¬†¬†¬†¬† 50% OFF! Android Instant Apps Rolling Out to Some Smartphones and Apps GO The feature will start rolling out globally soon Feb 14, 2017 13:26 GMT ¬†¬∑¬† By Alexandra Vaidos ¬†¬∑¬† Share:¬† Last month, we reported that Google started a limited live trial for Instant Apps, after announcing the new feature during last year‚Äôs edition of Google I/O. Now it seems that some users can already enjoy the feature and Wish seems to be the first app to employ it. The whole concept behind Instant Apps is to allow users to open and use applications from anywhere, without having to actually install them first. Google has been slowly but surely testing the feature, which has started to be made available to more and more users. According to Ausdroid, Instant Apps doesn‚Äôt work for anyone, but some users can set it up and try it easily. They simply need to go to the Settings menu on Android phones, tap Google Settings, find Instant Apps setting and tap the switch to enable it. Users must read and agree to the terms and conditions before the feature can be enabled. Instant Apps is already available to a number of services Instant Apps seems to be available for Wish, BuzzFeed, Periscope and Viki for the time being, while it should reach other options soon. Users simply need to search for Wish‚Äôs website in their browser and get the option to use an Instant App. The application opens instantly, without having to download it from Google‚Äôs Play Store. Instant Apps feature on Android It seems that whenever users tap on a link, Google Play checks if an Instant App exists and runs it without installation. Instant Apps are kept on the device temporarily, they should take up little space, but it‚Äôs unclear after how much time they‚Äôre automatically removed. According to some reports, Instant Apps can be enabled on Google‚Äôs Nexus and Pixel phones running on Android Nougat. Google is expected to expand the service to other smartphones as well, but that might take a while.

We hit the headline numbers, key metrics, and dig through management's comments to catch all the info investors need to know. Sarah Priestley and Dylan Lewis (TMFSarahp) Feb 14, 2017 at 12:11PM Two big heavyweights of the tech industry, PayPal¬†(NASDAQ:PYPL) and Alphabet¬†(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), reported their fourth-quarter results earlier this month, and Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Sarah Priestley have dug through the reports. In this episode of Industry Focus: Tech, they share the most interesting points from both reports, from the most important earnings numbers to little Q&A gems that shed some light on each companies' long-term plans, and more.¬† A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 27, 2017. Dylan Lewis:¬†Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's¬†Friday, Jan. 27, and we're breaking them¬†quarterly results from¬†PayPal¬†and¬†Alphabet. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis,¬†and I'm joined in the studio by fool.com¬†tech editor Sarah Priestley. Sarah,¬†how's it going? Sarah Priestley:¬†It's good,¬†it's a pleasure to be here, thank you for having me. Lewis: Are¬†you excited for pizza day? Priestley:¬†I am very excited. It's¬†going to derail my New Year's resolutions,¬†but that's OK.¬†[laughs]¬† Lewis: That's a callback to your¬†episode with the Vincent Shen. Are you finding that the Apple Watch is being helpful? Priestley:¬†Yes. It's¬†definitely reminding me at 9 p.m. that I have done 0 steps,¬†so I just end up walking around my living room¬†like a crazy person. Lewis: I do that when I'm on the phone all the time. That's¬†how I get my exercise in. Priestley:¬†That's¬†probably a good idea, yeah. Lewis: So,¬†Sarah, a ton going on in tech¬†this week, the next couple weeks with earnings. Two pretty followed Fool¬†companies reported yesterday after the bell. We dug into the reports and¬†are ready to talk about them. You did¬†some of the heavy lifting with PayPal; I dug into Alphabet. Why don't we¬†talk about PayPal first. How did the results look? Priestley:¬†To give you an overview for the fourth quarter,¬†earnings came in at $0.42 per share. $2.9 billion in revenue. Operating revenue was a little¬†higher than expected at 21%. Transactions were $1.8 billion. But the volume was¬†below expected. Expected was $100 billion and they delivered $99.3 billion. And that is why share prices are down about 3.5% this morning. So,¬†it seems like a slight overreaction¬†when you dig into their numbers. But, yeah,¬†that's the reason for the share price falling. Lewis: And that's really one of the core metrics that investors tend to focus on for them as a company, right? Priestley:¬†Absolutely. They really are¬†measured on engagement, so¬†number of customers, and engagement of those customers,¬†and the key metrics for those. Lewis: Looking beyond some of the top line numbers,¬†what else popped up to you in the report? Priestley:¬†The¬†operating margin for the fourth quarter was down to 15.4%. The reason that we're¬†commenting on this is that that's a lot,¬†it takes up a lot of room¬†in the bullish theses,¬†that the new partnerships they've started with¬†a lot of the banks,¬†Visa,¬†Mastercard, they're going to really pressure their margins down. Lewis: Is the thought there that they're working with very big institutions and big players, and they just don't¬†have the negotiating room that they might with some smaller players?¬† Priestley:¬†Absolutely. That's part of it. And also,¬†it's just the standard transaction payment. It's¬†the same thing for¬†Square¬†and other payment processors; it's a standard transaction amount on card processing. So, that¬†15.4% compared to 16.1%¬†in the fourth quarter of last year -- you can see, that's quite a decline there. Management has talked about the fact that they are really doing everything they can to leverage their other income against this. And I feel like they've done a pretty good job. Their CEO, Dan¬†Schulman,¬†has said that they won't be a slave to quarter-to-quarter margin performance. Lewis: Which is¬†something we like to hear as Foolish investors. Priestley:¬†That's¬†very true. And,¬†I would also comment that¬†the management team is really¬†being driven for their compensation package on the¬†long-term performance of this stock,¬†and I think that really shows in their reporting. They're¬†focused on free cash flow in their¬†projects, and what they're delivering to their customers. Just to give you a couple of the year-over-year figures: Earnings per share for the year¬†increased 15% to $1.15. Non-GAAP was $1.50 on guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. That's pretty good. Revenue for the full year was up 17%, and 21% on a currency-neutral basis, and they guided for 19%, so they really beat that. Lewis: Like Alphabet, their¬†fiscal Q4 comes¬†with the calendar Q4, so¬†we were able to look at full year results here,¬†and not just the quarterly results. What's going on with total payment volume?¬†I know that's something that people really like to focus on with them. Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†absolutely.¬†If we had seen total payment volume less than 25%,¬†I think we would have seen a bigger decline in the stock price. Luckily, for the fourth quarter,¬†payment volume was up 25%. As I said, the¬†actual processed amount was $99.3 billion, which missed the expectations. Interestingly, the majority of this was pushed by international. International¬†expanded 27%. The U.S. was 23%.¬† Lewis: And¬†for the¬†unacquainted, total payment volume is just¬†the gross amount that they are¬†helping to facilitate. Priestley:¬†Yes. The way to look at this is,¬†the total payment volume is the number of¬†payments that they process. Then, the transaction is the amount that they process. So, they're¬†averaging about $56 per transaction right now. That's¬†slightly down from $60 that they were averaging a couple quarters ago. But¬†it's still very good. Lewis: So, for the amount per transaction to be down, they¬†must be doing more total transactions¬†to be making it up in volume¬†and still be seeing growth, right? Priestley:¬†Yes,¬†you're exactly right.¬†I will also comment that, of their transactions in their Q4, $100 billion was mobile payments, which is an increase of 55%, and it's almost a third now of their transactions processed. Which is fantastic, and I think the management team has really isolated that as an opportunity for the company. That's where they're going to really demonstrate their industry leadership. The market is moving toward mobile, and they're really pioneering in the mobile industry. Lewis: So what can people expect looking forward, either first quarter¬†of 2017 or¬†further out, broadly in 2017? Priestley:¬†Absolutely. I'll look for 2017¬†quarter four revenue we're expecting to grow¬†on a currency neutral basis¬†16% to 18%. That gives you a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. That was¬†actually¬†slightly more conservative than¬†some analysts were expecting, which played into their share price¬†performance today. But full-year performance is strong, revenue growth 15% to 17% and 17% to 19% currency neutral, which gives you about $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion. Lewis: Is there¬†anything to worry about with¬†some of these numbers that we're looking at, that¬†management growth projections are different than¬†what the market is expecting? Because,¬†they are still very much in growth mode as a business, and I know that early on, those projections, if they start to decelerate at all, can start to scare people off a little bit. Priestley:¬†I think they have been fairly conservative¬†in some of their estimations,¬†because they really do have a huge potential with the mobile traffic. I think,¬†if you look at some of their projects that they're¬†working on now, Venmo has increased 100% year over year. It was¬†Time Magazine's¬†best app, it's processed $5.6 billion, which was up 126%. So,¬†I think they have a¬†huge potential with a lot of the projects they're working on; they've¬†experienced huge growth. The problem with these is that they are not monetized yet. And an¬†analyst actually raised the question in the earnings call: "Is your¬†projection in 2017 building in¬†some of the expectations for¬†monetizing this, and also Xoom?" which is their international money transfer program. They dismissed this. They said¬†it was pushing out to 2018, some of the¬†opportunities,¬†and that they will be focused on growth. So, I think,¬†for 2017, these might be conservative estimates. But for 2018,¬†we might actually start to see¬†the fruits of that labor. Lewis: Yeah, and you said, 55% of¬†what was being processed, broadly for the business, was¬†coming from mobile. When you look at Venmo specifically,¬†that is almost entirely mobile. It's more peer-to-peer. There are¬†some questions about whether or not they will be able to monetize that very well,¬†and what that might look like, because me giving you $5 because¬†you bought me lunch the other day, they don't really take anything on that. Priestley:¬†No,¬†they don't. And¬†something to say is,¬†it's becoming a hugely crowded market. I think¬†PayPal, to some degree, has a first-mover advantage, but they're¬†definitely not the biggest player in this industry. The banks have gotten together and created clearXchange, which is a peer-to-peer¬†payment which is also free right now. It's¬†owned by the banks, so it has a lot of clout. Whether or not people pick it up to the rate that they've picked up Venmo, which is¬†hugely popular with millennials, a lot of our friends use it all the time, we use it. Also,¬†Apple. Apple has grown hugely. Tim Cook in his last earnings call -- so,¬†this is a bit outdated -- said that¬†75% of¬†swiping transactions were from Apple Pay. Lewis: Wow. It's¬†hard to believe.¬†Anecdotally, though, when I'm out with my friends,¬†and maybe you can lend some color on this too, if someone covers the tab,¬†I'm paying them via Venmo. No one is ever like, "Do you have¬†Bank of America¬†mobile payment processing?" So, they do seem to have that first-mover¬†advantage, and I think they have that name recognition. When you have that huge installed base, as they do, it really comes down to whether they can flip the monetization switch on. I guess investors are¬†going to have to be patient on that, if¬†management is pushing that out to 2018. Priestley:¬†Absolutely. I will say,¬†they do have a lot of initiatives that are panning out for them right now. One Touch¬†basically enables you¬†to fill in your bank details, and you work through PayPal,¬†and you can just click one button at the checkout and it's transacted through¬†PayPal, which is hugely beneficial for mobile.¬†I don't know about you, but frequently, when I'm¬† looking at shoes online, as soon as I get to¬†the card payment, and you have to zoom in on those small boxes and put your card numbers in, they lose me. I think it's something like a¬†74% cart-abandonment rate on mobile. Lewis: So when¬†people reach that checkout phase and they¬†see that they need to drop in their credit card number, their security code, their address, shipping address, zip code, all that stuff,¬†they wind up ditching it? Priestley:¬†Absolutely. But, PayPal One Touch,¬†they have 87% conversion rate on mobile. That's incredible. They've had¬†a lot of people starting to use that. They have added a lot of One Touch users. And, I think, of their merchants, about one-third right now are on One Touch. And they just launched this last year. So there's a huge¬†potential here for them to really deliver on their promise. They've said they want to make customers' lives easier, and they're doing that, absolutely. Lewis: Anything else that¬†management provided color on with the business, and¬†strategically where they're looking, that¬†investors should know? Priestley:¬†I think the focus is absolutely on mobile. Dan Schulman has¬†definitely commented on the fact that mobile is the biggest¬†opportunity for them, and there are a lot of industry tailwinds that they're experiencing right now. And¬†I would completely agree. I think¬†Black Friday this year was the biggest online shopping day in history. In¬†quarter three last year -- we're still waiting for quarter four --¬†the Census Bureau said that¬†online retail made up 10% of all retail transactions. So you can see that if they are positioning themselves well to benefit from this, it should be a rising tide that lifts all boats. Lewis: I know they've¬†talked a little bit in the past about¬†continuing to be an asset-light business. Is that something that management recommitted to in¬†the most recent call? Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†absolutely. This is something that analysts have been focusing on. I definitely noticed a couple of questions about this in the earnings call. Square offers capital, it offers loans, as part of its services. It's not a huge part of their business, but it is a risk area of the business. So, in the fourth quarter, they had $123 million loss on loans. As a service similar to the company Square, which deals mostly with small businesses, but obviously this is individuals, PayPal has access to a lot of people's information and their spending habits and how much money they have. So they want to really leverage that information, and offer it out to partners to facilitate the loans using their information, which takes the risk away from PayPal, but they're still generating a percentage of income from it. So, overall, Dan Schulman¬†commented that it's a really competitive environment for this. I think the payment space is¬†just getting more and more competitive, every angle of it. But¬†overall, I think this is definitely a good move¬†for the company. It's the right decision,¬†it's going to eliminate some risk. But¬†it's also potentially going to bring in a degree of¬†revenue too, if they can grow that segment. Lewis: So,¬†it seems like the general takeaway here is: Wait and see with a lot of the company's¬†mobile initiatives. The core business¬†seems to be humming along. There was a little bit of disappointment,¬†but nothing thesis-altering,¬†nothing crazy in the report. Priestley:¬†No,¬†absolutely not. And they didn't touch too much on¬†some of their partners. They've had some really high-profile¬†partnerships with¬†Alibaba, Vodafone¬†in the U.K. and Europe, and many others; Discover, that they recently¬†announced. They didn't touch on that too much, so we can't really give investors a good flavor for how that's going, only that it's in line with their¬†expectations. So,¬†yeah, I agree with what you said. I think¬†mobile is going to be a big area of focus, we'll continue to have a look at those transaction volumes and customer engagement. Lewis:¬†So¬†Sarah,¬†I said that you did the heavy lifting on PayPal. I did most of the homework with Alphabet's earnings.¬†I'm going to flip it over to you and let you host for the second half of the show. Priestley:¬†It's¬†really nice to not be in the hot seat.¬†[laughs]¬† Lewis: Yeah.¬†I'll stop firing questions at you. It's my turn. Priestley:¬†So, yeah, Alphabet¬†reported the same time, yesterday after the bell. What were the results? Lewis: Overall, Alphabet's¬†revenue came in at about $26.1 billion for Q4, up 22% year over year, which beat analysts' estimates of $25.3 billion. Earnings per share came in at $7.56, slightly lower than analysts' projections of $7.63 per share. I think the real story -- and what caused some of the¬†immediate reaction for the stock -- was that adjusted profit missed by much more. That came in at $9.36 a share, versus expectations of $9.64 a share. We saw, after hours, the stock was down about 2.5% to 3%. That's what most of the market seemed to really fixate on. Priestley:¬†And what was the cause of that? Lewis: Tax rate, basically, is the short of it. In Q4, Alphabet had an effective tax rate of 22%. They also highlighted their broad 2016 tax rate, because they're able to report whole fiscal year results as well. The company's effective tax rate for the year was 19%. That's a big bump. And you realize that average is also incorporating other quarters. You can get a sense of how much more they were paying out in taxes this quarter. Really, if you want to get down to the nitty-gritty,¬†MarketWatch¬†writer Jeremy Owen does¬†a really good job breaking down the specifics, but¬†the gist of the issue is,¬†the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued some changes a while back,¬†basically impacting¬†how companies can treat stock-based compensation for their adjusted earnings numbers. And that wound up impacting results for this quarter. Moving forward, the company will¬†no longer be excluding stock-based compensation expenses from their non-GAAP results, which should smooth things out. But they wound up dealing with a little bit of a hiccup this quarter to reconcile. Priestley:¬†Yeah, that's¬†really unusual, the change for GAAP there. Lewis: Yeah. Typically, you think of non-GAAP numbers as being¬†something where the Financial Accounting Standards Board gives people a¬†decent amount of latitude to operate how they want to. But¬†they like to rein things in every now and then,¬†specifically with stock-based compensation because it's something that a lot of firms use to make their non-GAAP numbers look quite a bit better than their GAAP¬†numbers, especially in the tech space. Looking at¬†a couple of the different segments, their Google¬†segment, which is search, ads,¬†Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube,¬†pretty much anything that falls under their internet properties, came in at $25.8 billion. So,¬†looking at a company with $26 billion in quarterly revenue, that's the meat of it right there. That is¬†generally performing pretty well. Their Google Sites segment, which is the¬†majority of that, was up 20% year over year. Network revenue up 7% year over year. Other revenue, which is a smaller portion¬†a little bit less related to the internet properties within that segment -- think¬†Hardware, Google Play, and their cloud segment -- was $3.4 billion, which was up 62% year over year. So,¬†that's a very fast-growing segment within¬†Sundar Pichai's Google area of the business. I think,¬†if you're looking for indicators for them, the two big ones that tell the story for the ad business and what's going on with some of the internet properties: Aggregate paid clicks, which is basically the¬†number of times that people are interacting with ads online, was up 36% year over year. Aggregate cost per click, or CPCs, as they're commonly known, was down 15% year over year. This is¬†not really a surprise. This is a story that's been¬†playing out for a long time. We¬†talked about the shift to mobile when we were¬†talking about PayPal. The same thing is happening with internet search. CPCs have been driven down¬†because the effectiveness of¬†mobile ads isn't necessarily quite the same as it is for desktop. But for the longest time, Google has been able to make it up on volume. There's¬†actually quite a parallel there with¬†what happened with PayPal and the¬†volume making up for the smaller transactions. We're¬†seeing the same effects here with Alphabet. Priestley:¬†Would you suggest that's¬†something that investors should include in their thesis going forward? Lewis: I think it's something that, at¬†this point, we shouldn't be too surprised by. This story has been playing out for a decent amount of time. If it really¬†accelerates, you might have to worry. But they have been very good at¬†making the volume make it work out. Eventually, mobile will need to find a floor somewhere, and enjoy that. But so long as we're still in that¬†transition to mobile,¬†I think we're going to continue to see this for a while, unfortunately. Priestley:¬†OK. What about the Other Bets¬†segment? I know there have been some interesting moves this year. Lewis: Yeah, this is¬†something that people love to ask about, because it's like, "Where is¬†Google wasting all of this money?" As a reminder, this is basically all the stuff they do that isn't tied to their¬†internet properties. Think of it as their moonshot projects. The big financial contributors for this segment are Nest, Fiber, and Verily. They tend to¬†focus on a full-year breakout¬†for the segment¬†because the numbers are so small¬†relative to the overall business. But revenue came in at $809 million for 2016, which was up¬†82% year over year. Operating loss¬†not including stock-based compensation was $2.9 billion, down slightly year over year. But, this¬†segment is still a money pit for Alphabet, and I think it will¬†continue to be. They have reined in costs¬†a little bit under CFO Ruth Porat. I think she has forced all of the Other Bets¬†initiatives to¬†at least be able to show a path to monetization, or a road map to¬†what that might look like. But I think there's a certain test-and-innovate¬†atmosphere that they want to maintain. And¬†investors have been OK with that, because their core internet business just prints money for them. Something that is¬†interesting with them and the Other Bets segment is, they spun out¬†Waymo, which is their autonomous driving¬†segment. For the longest time, that was the Google Self-Driving Car Project. A couple months ago, they said, "This is a stand-alone business unit, and it will be nested within the Alphabet holding structure. It will continue to be in Other Bets." And¬†we didn't get any financial insight into what's going on with that. But they talked about it in the call. Ruth Porat¬†provided some commentary on what they're¬†basically doing with Waymo as a blueprint for what they will continue to be doing with Other Bets. Not a ton to report there,¬†but this is something that Daniel Sparks and I¬†talked about in a podcast when they announced that a few months ago. As we, in the next couple quarters, over¬†the next year, continue to get more information about Waymo,¬†I think we can look at that specific business segment and see the path for¬†what's going to be going on for some of the Other Bets as they¬†continue to mature and eventually see monetization. So, not a ton to report with Other Bets stuff, but¬†at least we have something that we can start to track for what the company's ambitions might be. Priestley:¬†Absolutely. It¬†looks like they're moving forward with that. Was there¬†anything else in the numbers that stood out to you in the earnings call? Lewis:¬†I think¬†some of the things that people need to keep in mind¬†with this report,¬†because the stock was down after hours, I think¬†as of taping this morning, they were down 40 or 50 basis points,¬†so not a crazy reaction like 3% that we saw¬†after hours yesterday, but still down,¬†I think people might be scratching their heads a little bit with some of the tax stuff they saw. Prior to the report,¬†the company was trading at all-time highs. It's¬†traded up for a while. I think it's somewhere in the teens in the last year or so. So, there's that. And¬†also, Alphabet does not provide detailed¬†quarterly guidance. Most¬†companies do offer up that guidance, and analysts create their own¬†models based on those numbers, those line items, and they have their¬†puts and takes to¬†tweak it slightly. But because Alphabet doesn't give¬†those baseline expectations, the¬†likelihood of actual numbers being¬†different than analysts expectations is¬†slightly higher than it would be¬†for other companies. So, the market's reaction¬†is always, I think, generally going to be¬†a little bit sharper than what we might see¬†for a company that does offer standard guidance. Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†because they have nothing ready¬†to peg their estimates to. Lewis: Yeah. They have¬†the general trend of things¬†and what they can glean from commentary. But¬†very often, you'll see¬†analysts' expectations more or less mirror guidance with¬†slight adjustments. Not having that as a crutch¬†can just add some unpredictability to things. I think that's the way you have to think about it. Priestley:¬†Any other little gems? Lewis: Outside of the¬†numbers, something that caught my eye that I think is a great point, and¬†really underscores the importance¬†of reading company conference calls, and¬†not just relying on the numbers that you see reported¬†and the quick earnings takes you'll see online: Mark Mahaney from¬†RBC Capital Markets¬†in the Q&A¬†section of the call asked this¬†really great question, and I think it points to a looming risk for¬†Alphabet, and I just want to highlight that for listeners. He said, "It¬†looks to me like Google devices are being outsold 10 to 1 or¬†something like that in most homes. It's immaterial now,¬†but you could see you in five years¬†there's a new voice search interaction interface¬†and it's not Google in the home. That¬†could be a real challenge for the company." And¬†he was basically positing, "What are you guys doing about all of the virtual-assistant and smart-home devices?" Priestley:¬†Yeah,¬†great question. Lewis: Yeah. And¬†Sundar Pichai,¬†Google CEO,¬†he gave that generally positive answer,¬†talking about the investments the company is making¬†and how they're working toward voice search, and how they're trying to meet consumers¬†in every situation that they might be using voice search,¬†whether it be phones, TV, homes, cars, whatever. But really, at its core, Mahaney's question is¬†getting at this idea of: Amazon's Echo¬†devices are selling like hotcakes. If the installed base for them,¬†or really any other virtual assistant, gets¬†massive, and consumers start using those devices¬†for the types of things and the purposes that¬†people are generally using Google mobile and¬†desktop search for,¬†what does that do for your business? I don't want to be alarmist with any of this. I am an Alphabet shareholder,¬†I really love the company. But I think he makes a good point. Earlier this month, actually, at an ad industry¬†conference, there was an Amazon¬†VP¬†talking about some of the capabilities¬†and some of the opportunities¬†that Amazon might explore. That led¬†some analysts to speculate that¬†the company might be interested in exploring paid search with its Alexa product. This is not something that is a next-quarter, next-year issue. But over the next five to 10 years,¬†we need to keep an eye on how people are using search, and¬†how people are using home assistants or¬†virtual assistants. Because,¬†if we see that slowly eat into¬†what would otherwise be desktop or mobile search,¬†you have to wonder about how that might¬†impact Google's core business, and really¬†what prints money for them and allows them to fund¬†all of these other projects. Priestley:¬†Yeah. And also, which products they're using. If¬†everybody starts adopting the Google Nest, then they're good. Lewis: Yeah. If people are using Nest or Google¬†Assistant, then yeah, not a huge problem,¬†that will keep them within that ecosystem. If they are using products that don't lean on¬†Google search, and you have platforms that are¬†able to monetize that search,¬†Google might get crowded out a little bit. Again, Google did $26 billion in revenue this quarter. The¬†vast majority of that was online ads. It's a huge market. I think people's more in-depth searching, or more research-based stuff, is¬†always going to be on desktop or mobile. You can only glean so much from audio.

Email Password Remember me Forgot¬†password? ¬† ¬† Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports ¬† ¬† Google has deleted over one million websites from search results Listen | Print By James Walker ¬† ¬† Feb 14, 2017 in Internet Google has reached a new milestone in its quest to remove unlawful websites from the Internet. It recently received its one millionth takedown request as the service continues to grow. Amongst the sites reported include NASA and The White House. Google discloses how many search results it removes in its daily Transparency Report. It logs how many requests it has received too, letting users check how much content has been withdrawn. As TorrentFreak noticed, the website counter reached one million for the first time this week. In total, over 2.1 billion pages have been deleted. Google will takedown websites that offer illegal content contravening copyright rules. The majority of its action is concentrated on piracy sites and torrent providers who allow Internet users to consume content without paying for it. When a report is submitted to Google, the company first verifies that the person behind the request is the copyright owner. The takedown notice is scrutinised for accuracy and completeness before being passed on for authentication. If Google finds the site in question has contravened copyright rules, it will remove the URL from search results and notify the administrator. The administrator is able to appeal the decision, starting a lawsuit with the claimant if required. Google has now been asked to take down over one million distinct websites Google Although the process generally works well, it's clear not every report is genuine. Looking closer at Google's Transparency Report throws up several interesting takedown notices that don't target your typical piracy provider. Media organisations such as The BBC and The New York Times, established content providers like Netflix and government bodies including NASA and The White House have been reported to Google. Needless to say, the company didn't take action. The reasoning behind the notices isn't disclosed. Although many of the requests can be attributed to software false-positives and even disgruntled users, it's possible the sites are being targeted by more malicious activity. Google is constantly on the watch for governments that try to censor content, providing Transparency Report alerts when this occurs. It routinely receives requests from states that want political articles and videos to be removed from the Internet. This could account for the relatively high number of takedown requests made against major news publications. While the activity of governments certainly has certainly contributed to the rise in requests, the overwhelming majority are still made against run-of-the-mill piracy sites. The number of takedown notices issued has reduced slightly from a high in September 2016 but is still on a generally increasing trend. With sites frequently reappearing days or even hours after they're shut down, Google's yet to gain full control of the situation. Piracy sites remain huge online traffic magnets showing no sign of decline, leaving Google to sift through thousands of copyright owner complaints each day.

About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Menu About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Search advertisement Homepage ¬ª Miscellaneous ¬ª The full scoop on Google‚Äôs mission to train 1 million Africans The full scoop on Google‚Äôs mission to train 1 million Africans Posted 4 days ago by Edwin Chabuka (@techzim) Read 7 Comments As you may have read from our most recent post, Google is on a mission to train 1 million Africans on fundamental IT skills. Zimbabwe is also included in this road map and after a conversation with Trust Nhokovedzo the coordinator for training in Zimbabwe we were able to get more¬†details on what exactly this is and how it‚Äôs going to take place. Why has this seemingly only started now and yet the program has been running in other countries like Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria etc‚Ä¶ for almost a year? The program actually started early 2016 which is when Google made the announcement of wanting to train 1 million Africans to wise-up in terms of digital skills. However the reason why it had not started yet in Zimbabwe is because there is a road map to it and each country has to wait its turn. At the moment the program it taking place in Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa. In Zimbabwe the program is scheduled to start this month that is February 2017 to June 2017. I noticed in some articles the mention of an organisation called Livity. What is their role in all this? advertisement Google is the coordinator and sponsor of the project and it is partnering up with training companies in each country to train individuals as trainers and Livity is one of them. Centum learning limited is the training partner that Google will be working with to train trainers for Zimbabwe.¬†Target for Zimbabwe is to train 20 000 people I would appreciate any background that would be helpful in having a ¬†clear understanding and potential impact of this program, especially you opinions about it. There is a potential of half a billion Africans that will be using the internet by 2020 which presents a huge opportunity for businesses as well as individuals to leverage the internet to give their business an online presence. Objective is to ensure people know how they can use technology to leverage their business. Understand some economic principles that operate in the digital space and relevance. How to capitalize on the increase in internet usage to expand your business‚Äô footprint regionally and globally. Contents of the training focuses on how the world has gone digital and how it has moved on from traditional flyers to online marketing and digital marketing. It also incorporates practical skills in the line of the fundamentals of building your business online presence. This includes effective web design, how to market the website as well as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and how to run adverts on your website. It also introduces people to mobile friendly websites as a large portion of internet users in Africa access it through mobile devices. Where will the training take place and how am I eligible to register? We are planning to target about 31 tertiary institutions in Zimbabwe primarily Universities, Private colleges, Polytechnics and teachers colleges. First rollout should start February 2017. This program is targeting people between 18 and 35 years of age. Admission is free and after completing the course you receive a certificate of attendance. No qualifications are required for individuals seeking to be trained. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Centum learning limited, Google, Livity, Zimbabwe Previous Post ¬´ YouTube Go, the app designed for data friendly video viewing is now available or Android Next post Econet says its owed over US$25 million in interconnection fees by NetOne & TelOne ¬ª 7 Comments stan says: February 12, 2017 at 8:20 AM why not 18 to 40 on age.

Georgiadis, Mattel‚Äôs new CEO. Photo: Youtube EL SEGUNDO, CA ‚Äì Mattel, the company behind such iconic toys as Barbie, Hot Wheels, and the Fisher-Price brand, has a new chief executive officer, Margaret ‚ÄúMargo‚Äù Georgiadis. The former Google Americas President is the second executive to be appointed Mattel‚Äôs CEO since early 2015. For six years, Georgiadis led Google‚Äôs commercial operations and ad sales in the US, Canada and Latin America. She took over the CEO position at Mattel on February 8 and also joined the board of directors. Georgiadis follows Christopher A. Sinclair, the long-time board member who led the toy maker since early 2015. Besides her executive position at Google, Georgiadis has also served as COO of daily deals e-commerce website Groupon and as chief marketing officer at Discover Financial Services, as reported in Fortune. She is also a board member for McDonald‚Äôs and renewable products maker Amyris. ‚ÄúInspiring children through play and creativity is crucial to early development and no company has done more in that space over many generations than Mattel,‚Äù Georgiadis said in a statement, as quoted in Fortune. ‚ÄúAs a parent, I have seen this first hand and am honored to be joining the Company at this exciting time of renewed focus.‚Äù Mattel is currently in a relatively stable position as Georgiadis takes over as CEO. Sales are improving for the company‚Äôs core brands including Barbie with innovations started during Sinclair‚Äôs tenure received well by the toy-buying. The major makeover for the doll with new body types, hair styles, and shades of skin added for more diversity to the standard slender Barbie was especially appreciated by consumers after decades of complaints about Barbie‚Äôs unrealistic body proportions. Technology was also added in more appropriate ways to Mattel toys through Sinclair‚Äôs work with tech startups after internal efforts achieved only middling results. Sinclair also tried to update the speed of the company‚Äôs decision-making process to keep up with the pace of the times. Formerly a PepsiCo executive, Sinclair arrived at Mattel during a time when sales and the company‚Äôs stock price were declining. Core brands including Barbie seemed lagging behind in terms of innovation, so vital in the competitive toy business. Sinclair succeeded Bryan Stockton, who resigned after a few years of struggling with the iconic toy maker‚Äôs troubles. In a Mattel news release Sinclair said of Georgiadis‚Äô appointment, ‚ÄúOver the last two years, with the help of all of our colleagues around the world, we have dramatically transformed Mattel ‚Äì reenergizing our creative culture, restoring excitement to our iconic brand portfolio and delivering on our vision to make Mattel the recognized leader in play, learning and development worldwide. I could not be more proud of the organization and what it has accomplished, or more excited about the Company‚Äôs future with Margo Georgiadis as our CEO. Margo is a proven and extraordinarily talented executive with a deep understanding of how to build and scale brands on a global basis and expertise in effectively engaging consumers and retail partners in a rapidly evolving digital world. She has successfully led efforts to deliver above market growth and profitability by creating transformational partnerships across content, media and technology providers and through innovation in product development and customer engagement.‚Äù Sinclair added, ‚ÄúAs Executive Chairman, I will work with Margo, Richard Dickson, and the rest of the executive team on the smoothest possible transition.‚Äù Continuing to boost sales of Mattel brands including Barbie, Hot Wheels, and American Girl will be Georgiadis top priority. The challenge may grow increasingly difficult as youngsters play more on mobile devices, tablets, iPads, and cell phones. Other toy makers including Hasbro and Lego also face the challenge of adding technology to their toys while still encouraging traditional ways of playing. Speculation on mergers and acquisitions is also rife for the major toy makers with some suggesting that potential merger talks may be going on between Mattel and Hasbro. Mattel‚Äôs appointment of Georgiadis adds another woman executive to the list of only 27 female executives that run Fortune 500 companies. According to the latest Fortune 500 list, Mattel is ranked #450. Georgiadis becomes the second woman CEO at Mattel. Jill Barad was the first woman to run the toy company for short time in the late 1990‚Äôs until she was removed after the widely unpopular $3.5 billion acquisition of software company Learning Co.

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 8:55 am Tue Feb 14, 2017 Amnesty: hackers spent months building personas used to phish Qatari labor activists From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS In a new report, Amnesty International summarizes the security research they did on the victims of a sophisticated phishing attack aimed at Qatari labor activists, dubbed "Operation Kingphish." report this ad Several activists were approached by a personal calling themselves "Safeena Malik," who claimed to represent a human rights NGO. The Malik persona had a deep, years-long presence on social media, with hundreds of Linkedin contacts. The Malik persona targeted journalists, activists and organizers engaged in the struggle for labor rights in Qatar -- a notorious haven of forced labor and unsafe working conditions -- for months on end, carefully building up trust with them and sending them multiple forms of bait that sought (sometimes successfully) to capture their Google logins. The phishing attack itself took the form of a supposed link to a Google Doc; targets were sent to a lookalike page that seemed to be a login screen for Google, already populated with their real Google userids and avatars. The attackers were known to use a server in Doha, Qatar to stage their attacks. Amnesty stops short of blaming the attacks on the government of Qatar, but there is circumstantial evidence linking the two. The Gmail attack has been successful. Motherboard spoke to one journalist who inadvertently handed over their password, although they were suspicious of the document links and Malik's messages. (The journalist asked not to be identified as they engage in undercover work.) "I got a message on Christmas day, saying Happy Christmas!" the journalist said. In all, Amnesty believes Malik targeted nearly 30 people, judging by information left in an exposed server used in the attacks. A major part of the Malik identity is the substantial social media presence. Her LinkedIn profile appears to have lifted a bio from someone else, and her photos are seemingly a stolen mis-mash from other accounts across the web. On Facebook, Malik has joined several groups related to her targets, including communities that deal with migrant workers and forced labour, Amnesty's report reads. Sometimes, Malik will use her mutual connections to targets as leverage‚Äîmaybe a victim is more likely to chat if Malik is a friend of a friend.

This is where Google Forms can come in to help you. With useful templates, helpful features, and an intuitive interface, you can quickly build and customize the exact form you need Supercharge Your Google Forms and Get More out of Them Supercharge Your Google Forms and Get More out of Them The humble Google Forms has loads of uses. With the availability of add-ons, you can find more ways to tap into its usefulness than ever before. Read More . Here we show you how you can use Google Forms for common¬†business routines. Using the Templates and Features Google Forms has a variety of features for creating business forms. You can get off to a fast start with one of the templates offered and edit it to suit your needs.¬†To access the template options, sign into Google Forms and select Template Gallery from the top. Work Request The Work Request template has the basics you need for a simple work order like name, email address, description, priority, and due date. You can then use the Type section to distinguish the work area. You can keep that multiple-choice question and just update the answers to accommodate your business. For example, a work request for the information technology department may include options for software, hardware, and network services. Feedback Form The Customer Feedback template can be used for employee or training feedback as well as customers with a few simple adjustments. For instance, you can add a drop-down box question for an employee to choose the department that their feedback is aimed towards. Or for training, you can include a paragraph question so that trainees can offer suggestions for the next session. Registration Form The Event Registration template can be used for most any type of event. For business, you might use it for a conference, seminar, or training session. For multi-day events like a conference, you can use the checkbox question for participants to choose which days they will attend. Or for a training session, trainees can select a preferred time slot. The template also includes a required section at the bottom where the participant must acknowledge a fee. You can use this for paid seminars or conferences. Time Off Request The Time Off Request template is a handy form and may have everything you want already with no adjustments necessary. Sections include name, leave date, time of day, and type of leave. A convenient section at the end allows the user to write a paragraph for their reason of leave, if they like. If you would also like to capture the user‚Äôs email address, you can add this question quickly. Just click the plus icon to add a question, name it Email address, and Google Forms will automatically select the short answer question type for you. You can make it a required question by sliding the switch at the bottom. Creating Your Own Form If you would rather start from scratch with your own form, this is easier to do than you might think. Plus, you can save your form as a template and continue to use it with simple edits as needed.¬†First, head to Google Forms¬†to open an untitled form by clicking the Blank template from the Template Gallery. Team Update Form For receiving updates from your employees or team, you can create a form to obtain statuses. Add questions for the basics such as name and email address and then just customize your sections. For this example, we will use a project team update. You can add a drop-down question with options for which project the team member is working on. Based on the answer (project) that they choose, you can have them skip to another form section. This allows you to create sections for tasks specific to that project and the user will be automatically directed there. Create your Project question and answers by clicking the plus. Create the different task sections by clicking the Add Section. Name the sections and add the tasks per project. Return to the Project question, select the More (three-dot) icon and pick Go to section based on answer. Beside each answer, click the arrow and choose which section the user should be directed to when they select that answer. Injury Form Creating an injury form is also quite easy. After you add name and email address, you can add questions for things like date and time of injury, location of the occurrence, and severity of the injury. Using the severity question, you can select the Linear scale question option: Create your Severity question by clicking the plus. Choose Linear scale from the question options. Select the number scale that you would like to use from the drop-down boxes. Enter labels for the first and last numbers on the scale. Transfer Request Form If your company allows for transfers, whether to another city, local facility, or department, you can set up a transfer form in just minutes. Once again, include questions for name and email address and then customize your sections and questions. For this example, we will use the multiple choice grid question: Create your Transfer question by clicking the plus. Choose Multiple choice grid from the question options. Add your answers for the rows and columns. Select the More (three-dot) icon and pick Limit to one response per column to avoid confusion. Setting up the question: How the question will display: Tips and Tricks Google Forms offers a nice variety of features for questions and answers. But, you can take advantage of even more useful options 10 Advanced Tips & Tricks For Google Forms 10 Advanced Tips & Tricks For Google Forms If Google Forms is not yet your go-to form maker, it's time for us to change your mind. You may think you know everything there is to know about Google Forms, but thanks to Google's... Read More like these: Reusing Forms as Templates Open the form, click the More (three-dot) icon from the top navigation, and select Make a copy. You can then give the form its own name, select its folder, and share it with the same people. This is ideal when you want to use your form as a template. To edit the form, just open it from your main Google Forms screen and adjust as needed. Adding Data Validation Short answer, paragraph, and checkbox questions types offer a data validation option. This lets you ensure that you are receiving the answer(s) that you want. For example, using a checkbox question you can require that the user enter at least two answers. Or, for a paragraph question, you can limit the character count of the answer. To use this feature, select the More (three-dot) icon within the question and choose Data validation.

While both of these watches were designed to show off the newest version of the operating system, only the Watch Sport¬†comes packing LTE connectivity, an NFC chip, a heart rate sensor, and more. This comparison will take an in-depth look at these two new smartwatches so that you can decide if you would rather have a feature-packed smartwatch that tends to be on the bulkier side or an elegant and slim device that¬†doesn‚Äôt do much more than the basics‚Ä¶ First, let‚Äôs get the specs out of the way. The LG Watch Style has a 1.2-inch P-OLED 360√ó360 pixel display, a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 512MB of RAM, and a 240mAh battery. The Watch Sport¬†‚Äî being quite a bit bigger than the Style¬†‚Äî has a 1.38-inch P-OLED 480√ó480 pixel display, the same Snapdragon 2100 processor, 768MB of RAM, and a 430mAh battery. While they¬†share similar specs, the added RAM helps run all of the additional sensors and radios found exclusively in the Sport. Performance Please note that we have only had these watches in hand for a few days and this is not our full review of either the Sport or the Style (those are coming soon, so stay tuned!). That being said, though, both of these watches fly. The extra time that Google spent preparing Android Wear 2.0 for the world is quite apparent on these devices as everything runs more or less as smooth as butter. When comparing the Sport to the Style, that extra RAM appears to make things run just a little bit better. While it¬†isn‚Äôt much, you can tell from using both side-by-side that the Sport has the edge on performance. Is it enough to deter you from buying and using the Style? Definitely¬†not. If you only used the Style, you would still think it was one of the fastest smartwatches on the market. Battery life Battery life performance will differ from user-to-user and from day-to-day, and this is especially¬†true when talking about the Watch Sport. In addition to the added RAM and larger display with more pixels, the Sport has a handful of other sensors and radios that the Style doesn‚Äôt. These¬†include LTE connectivity,¬†NFC, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. Obviously, heavy use with a lot of screen on time of either watch will drain the battery, but so will constant use of the LTE or GPS features. Without heavy usage of the added functionality found in the Sport (and with only moderate usage of either watch,¬†mainly for checking notifications and opening several applications), they‚Äôll both easily make it¬†through an¬†average 8-hour workday. In our testing, the Style ended the day with a higher battery percentage and could have easily made it into the next morning, while the Sport was closer to being dead and needed to be charged overnight. GPS / NFC / LTE / Heart Rate Sensor LG Watch Sport Besides its physical size, the biggest difference between the¬†watches is that the Sport can just do so much more. If you wanted to go for a run¬†without your phone, download music, and track your exact location, all at the same time, you could thanks to the Watch Sport‚Äôs built-in LTE and GPS. And if¬†you‚Äôre exercising, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll want to use that heart rate sensor to track your heart rate. You can also pay for things with nothing but your watch and Android Pay. This is the world you could live in with the Sport. Final thoughts The Style basically lives up to its name of being stylish and not much more. The watch is small, extremely lightweight, supports Google‚Äôs MODE watch bands, and just looks beautiful. Its size is so small that you forget¬†you‚Äôre even wearing it at times. If notifications are all you want a smartwatch for, then it¬†isn‚Äôt even a question that the Style is what you should be looking into. It‚Äôs simple, it works, and it¬†won‚Äôt break the bank for $250. LG Watch Style If you want everything and more, then¬†you‚Äôll want the Sport. This one will cost you a little bit more, though, at $350. Plus, if you‚Äôre going to be using the LTE capabilities, you will¬†have to pay your cell phone carrier $10 to $20 a month for a data plan. In exchange, you‚Äôll have a much bulkier watch that feels premium and runs Android Wear better than any other device out there. The biggest drawbacks¬†include that it‚Äôs much bigger in size, and you¬†can‚Äôt change out the watchbands because of the LTE and GPS antennas. So which of these two smartwatches are you interested in picking up? The LG Watch Style is perfect if you love minimalism and just want to get the basic tasks done. But if you‚Äôre more hardcore or like having everything built into the wearable on your wrist, then the Watch Sport might be more up your alley. Unfortunately, the ideal watch for most people that fits right between these doesn‚Äôt exist. But either way, you will be getting a fantastically built device that runs Android Wear 2.0 beautifully and works like a charm. Keep an eye on the site as we will be publishing our full reviews of both the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style in the coming days. Also, let us know in the comments below¬†if you‚Äôre interested in hearing anything more specific about either of these wearables or if you decided to pick either of them up for yourself.

While it‚Äôs not the most exciting feature in the world, it suggests Google is trying to make Google Maps more social. Which, given the complete and utter failure of Google+, shouldn‚Äôt come as a major surprise. The latest update to Google Maps How Does Google Maps Work? How Does Google Maps Work? Google Maps is used by millions of people every day and you might be one of them, but how does it actually work and how does Google maintain its accuracy so well? Read More lets you create lists of places you have either visited or want to visit in the future. You can then share your lists of places with family and friends, or make them public for everyone. You can also follow lists others have created and shared. Save and Share With Google Maps Creating a list of places within Google Maps is simple. Just open the Google Maps app on Android or on iOS, find the place you want to add save for future reference, and then click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù. By default you can choose between three lists ‚Äî ‚ÄúFavorites,‚Äù ‚ÄúStarred Places,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWant to Go‚Äù. However, you also have the option of creating your own lists, and naming them whatever you want. You can keep these lists to yourself, or share them with others. If the latter, just click the ‚ÄúShare‚Äù button to send a link to family or friends. This should prove useful if sharing restaurants you want to try one weekend, or attractions you want to visit on vacation. Setting your list to ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù means anyone and everyone will be able to see it. Yes, that means those scary things called strangers. By the same token you‚Äôll also be able to see public lists created by other Google Maps users. Google‚Äôs New Social Strategy Given the number of different ways in which this feature could be used, this is a clear indication of Google‚Äôs intention to add social features to Google Maps. It‚Äôs a small first step, but it‚Äôs a first step nonetheless. After trying and failing to best Facebook time and time again Google's Plus: The Latest in Long Line of Social Flops Google's Plus: The Latest in Long Line of Social Flops Google's history of launching social network is a series of failures.

Do you regularly use Google Maps? Can you see yourself using the new Save feature? Are you likely to list places you have visited? Or places you want to visit?

From¬†waking up to setting cooking timers, it‚Äôs important for a clock app to be intuitive. An update now rolling out to Google‚Äôs Clock app brings¬†some minor tweaks¬†makes the jump to version 5.0‚Ä¶ Compared to version 4.6.1, users will immediately notice that tabs for the four core functions are now larger and clearly labeled. The size increase of the icons should have been enough to help distinguish between the functions, but text labels never hurt. For those who weren‚Äôt aware that you can¬†swipe between the panes, tabs now evenly stretch the full width of the display for easier navigation. (In this writer‚Äôs opinion, Google¬†should have probably just switched to a bottom bar navigation.) Additionally, the font is now much bolder as especially evident in ‚ÄòTimer.‚Äô In terms of functionality, the¬†‚ÄòDigital‚Äô style for time now has the option to show¬†seconds with a dedicated toggle in settings.¬†Previously, that feature was restricted to the analog mode. Also under the clock functionality, time zones now list how far behind/ahead a displayed city is to your current time zone. Update: Another new feature is the ability to set¬†any audio file as your¬†alarm or timer sound. Unfortunately, downloaded Play Music songs cannot be selected. Scroll down to ‚ÄòTimer sound‚Äô in settings to change. Version 5.0 of Clock is slowly rolling out now via the Play Store.

SUBSCRIBE Google: No comment on possibility of a Feb. 7 algorithm update Did your rankings in Google get better or worse over the past week? Many webmasters and SEOs are noticing some significant changes in Google's search rankings algorithm. Barry Schwartz on February 13, 2017 at 2:18 pm More Last Tuesday, Feb. 7, there seems to have been a Google algorithm change that adjusted how many sites rank ‚Äî both for good and bad. I‚Äôve been tracking the update since Feb. 8, and over time, more and more webmasters and SEOs have been taking notice of the ranking changes at Google. This seems to be unrelated to the unconfirmed link algorithm change from earlier in February. This new update seems to be more related to Panda, based on such things as content and site quality, versus link factors. Google has not confirmed the update and would not comment on what webmasters and SEOs have been noticing over the past week in the search results. So we cannot confirm if this was a content quality shift, link quality change or something else. But what we can say is that webmasters and SEOs are very busy noticing these ranking changes, through looking at ranking reports or their traffic from Google in their analytics, or using tracking tools that track visibility and other means. The automated tracking tools from Mozcast, RankRanger, Accuranker and others also all showed evidence of an algorithm update on Feb. 7. This update seems to have been somewhat significant, which is why we reached out to Google for a comment. If we hear more from Google, we will update you. But for now, this is all based on the conversation and chatter that I track closely within the industry.

Here are two screen shots of how it looks with the people also ask directly after the featured snippets: Here is an example of a featured snippet that currently doesn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúpeople also ask‚Äù feature after it: It is unclear if this change is a new search feature or a bug with the search results.

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. According to an article in The Verge.com, Google Maps has just introduced a new feature, giving rise to the question as to whether it is intending to become a social network. Apparently, it is now possible for users to create lists of favorite locations that can be shared with friends or family. There is also the ability to follow other people‚Äôs lists of favorite places. Users can send their favorite locations to others through social media, messaging apps, or by text or email. The update which has just been released is available for IOS and Android and is supposed to provide users with a better way to organize favorite restaurants, coffee shops and attractions such as museums and galleries in one location. The ability to create lists through Google Maps isn‚Äôt new, as it has been available for quite some time through the Local Guides program, but up until now, this function wasn‚Äôt available to all users. For quite some time, Google has assumed that people wish to use Google Maps for other purposes other than finding the best route from A to B. Just recently it has introduced a whole raft of additional features allowing people to tell whether it is easy to park in a particular neighborhood or to call an Uber through the app. The article raises the question as to whether the ability to share lists of locations through Google Maps is more like something you‚Äôd find on Facebook than through Google, and exactly how much people use Google Maps. Google has already mapped most of the world through Street View and uses real-time traffic updates through Waze. It includes all the most popular attractions and businesses, as well as ratings and comments that could only previously be sourced through others rating sites such as Yelp. Now, the hope is that users will take this information, personalizing it, and sending it to others. About Allison Halliday Allison Halliday is a Realty Biz News contributing writer.

SUBSCRIBE What is a pangolin? Google Valentine‚Äôs Day doodle series & pangolin game come to desktop After launching its first Valentine's Day doodle two days ago on mobile, Google is now sharing the doodle and its accompanying game on desktop. Amy Gesenhues on February 13, 2017 at 9:15 am More Google is using this Valentine‚Äôs Day to show its love for the pangolin, an endangered animal whose natural habitat stretches across Asia and Africa. According to Google, the animal is not only the world‚Äôs only scaly mammal, it is also the world‚Äôs most trafficked mammal. To raise awareness around the threat these animals face from poachers and smugglers, the site has created different versions of its Valentine‚Äôs Day Doodle game. In each, a pangolin makes its way across various terrains like Ghana, India and China ‚Äî collecting cocoa beans, musical notes and, today, ribbons. Google‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day doodle series began over the weekend when the site launched the first of its doodles, but only on mobile. Since Saturday, Google has used its doodle to promote different types of pangolins ‚Äî today‚Äôs featured species is the Chinese pangolin. Each of the doodles include a sharing icon, a heart icon that displayed a variety of pangolin facts and a search icon that serves up results for ‚Äúwhat is a pangolin‚Äù query. Today is the first day the doodle has displayed on Google‚Äôs desktop home page as well as on mobile. To help save the pangolins, the Google Doodle Blog points readers to the World Wildlife Fund: ‚ÄúTo learn more about the pangolin‚Äôs plight and to support WWF‚Äôs efforts to save the pangolin and other endangered species.‚Äù About The Author Amy Gesenhues Amy Gesenhues is Third Door Media's General Assignment Reporter, covering the latest news and updates for Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.

Now it seems that some users can already enjoy the feature and Wish seems to be the first app to employ it. The whole concept behind Instant Apps is to allow users to open and use applications from anywhere, without having to actually install them first. Google has been slowly but surely testing the feature, which has started to be made available to more and more users. According to Ausdroid, Instant Apps doesn‚Äôt work for anyone, but some users can set it up and try it easily. They simply need to go to the Settings menu on Android phones, tap Google Settings, find Instant Apps setting and tap the switch to enable it. Users must read and agree to terms and conditions, before the feature can be enabled.

Google is bringing artificial intelligence to a whole new set of devices, including Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches and the Raspberry Pi board, later this year. These devices don't require a set of powerful CPUs and GPUs to carry out machine-learning tasks. Google researchers are instead trying to lighten the hardware load to carry out basic A.I. tasks, as exhibited by last week's release of the Android Wear 2.0 operating system for wearables. [ Further reading: 3 months with Google Home: Fun, functional, and frustrating ] Google has added basic A.I. features to smartwatches with Android Wear 2.0, and those features can work within the limited memory and CPU constraints of wearables. Android Wear 2.0 has a "smart reply" feature, which provides basic responses to conversations. It works much the way predictive dictionaries do, but it can auto-reply to messages based on the context of the conversation. Google uses a new way to analyze data on the fly without bogging down a smartwatch. In conventional machine-learning models, a lot of data needs to be classified and labeled to provide accurate answers. Instead, Android Wear 2.0 uses a "semi-supervised" learning technique to provide approximate answers. "We're quite surprised and excited about how well it works even on Android wearable devices with very limited computation and memory resources," Sujith Ravi, staff research scientist at Google said in a blog entry. For example, the skimmed down machine-learning model can classify a few words -- based on sentiment and other clues -- and create an answer. The machine-learning model introduces a streaming algorithm to process data, and it provides trained responses that also factor in previous interactions, word relationships and vector analysis. The process is faster because the data is analyzed and compared based on bit arrays, or in the form of 1s and 0s. That helps analyze data on the fly, which tremendously reduces the memory footprint. It doesn't go through the conventional process of referring to rich vocabulary models, which require a lot of hardware. The AI feature is not intended for sophisticated answers or analysis of a large set of complex words. The feature can be used with third-party message apps, the researchers noted. It is loosely based on the same smart-reply technology in Google's messaging Allo app, which is built from the company's Expander set of semi-supervised learning tools. The Android Wear team originally reached out to Google's researchers and expressed an interested in implementing the "smart reply" technology directly in smart devices, Ravi said.¬† A.I. is becoming pervasive in smartphones, PCs and electronics like Amazon's Echo Dot, but it largely relies on machine learning taking place in the cloud. Machine-learning models in the cloud are trained, a process called learning, to recognize images or speech. Conventional machine learning relies on algorithms, superfast hardware, and a huge amount of data for more accurate answers. Google's technology is different than Qualcomm's rough implementation of machine learning in mobile devices, which hooks up algorithms with digital signal processors (DSPs) for image recognition or natural language processing. Qualcomm has tuned DSPs in its upcoming Snapdragon 835 to process speech or images at higher speeds, so A.I. tasks are carried out faster.¬† Google has an ambitious plan to apply machine learning through its entire business. The Google Assistant -- which is also in Android Wear 2.0 -- is a visible A.I. across smartphones, TVs, and other consumer devices. The search company has TensorFlow, an open-source machine-learning framework, and has its own inferencing chip called Tensor Processing Unit.

In years past, Google Chrome was easily the best. This time around it's a three-horse race. By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Networking | February 14, 2017 -- 01:47 GMT (17:47 PST) | Topic: Networking Last year, Google Chrome was the speediest Windows 10 web browser by a mile. This year, it's a different story. Picking out the best Windows 10 web browser isn't easy at all. The worse, however, by a country mile, is Internet Explorer 11. sjvn To put today's browsers to the test I ran them on the latest shipping edition of Windows 10 Home: Version 10240.17236. I ran the benchmarks on my latest Windows 10 test PC. This is a Dell XPS 8910. It's powered by a 3.4GHz Intel Core i7-6700 Quad-Core Processor, backed by a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750Ti graphics card with 2GBs of graphics memory. This tower PC also comes with 16GBs of RAM and a Terabyte, 7,200 RPM hard drive. In short, it's a powerful machine. Diving into the Dark Web: Where does your stolen data go? If your sensitive data is stolen online, where does it go -- and who sees it? One security team found out. Read More This, in turn, is connected to a Gigabit Ethernet switch. From there, it links to the internet with a 100Mbps connection. On this system, besides Windows 10's built-in Edge 38 and Internet Explorer (IE) 11, I tested the latest versions of the most popular desktop web browsers. These are Chrome 56, Firefox 51, and Opera 43. I didn't include Safari in this round-up because Apple no longer releases new major Safari updates for Windows. The 2012 version of Safari, 5.1.7, with some security patches, is still available. For each round of testings, I ran freshly installed vanilla web browsers after rebooting the system. I then ran the following series of benchmarks. In the past, I've used RoboHornet as a test. But, like its developers, I've given up on it. This benchmark hasn't been updated since 2012. JetSteam 1.1: This JavaScript benchmark builds on the foundation of the no-longer-supported SunSpider. It combines several JavaScript benchmarks to report a single score that balances them using geometric mean. JetStream includes benchmarks from the SunSpider 1.0.2 and Octane 2 JavaScript benchmark suites. This test suite also includes benchmarks from the LLVM compiler open-source project, compiled to JavaScript using Emscripten 1.13. It also includes a benchmark based on the Apache Harmony open-source project's HashMap and a port of the Cdx real-time Java benchmark, hand-translated to JavaScript. Larger scores are better on this benchmark. While Chrome dominates on this test in Windows 7, Edge, which is only available on Windows 10, took first place on JetStream with a score of 253.83. A long way back came Chrome with a score of 213.8. This was followed by Opera with 206.16 and Firefox with 188.87. IE 11 failed on the test. IE was unable to complete the bigfib.cpp test, which computes very long Fibonacci numbers. This would prove not to be the last test IE 11 was unable to complete. Kraken 1.1: This benchmark, which is based on the now obsolete SunSpider, also measures JavaScript performance. To this basic JavaScript testing, it added typical use case scenarios. Mozilla, Firefox's parent organization, created Kraken. With this benchmark, the lower the score, the better the result. With Kraken, it was a different story. Here, Opera, which is based on Google's open-source Chromium web browser, and Blink, Google's WebKit web browser engine fork, took first with 757.5 milliseconds (ms). Opera was followed by Firefox, at 915.3ms. Edge was right behind at third place with 927.1ms. Chrome fell well behind the others with a score of 1,134.6ms. IE stunk the joint up with a miserable score of 1,692.8ms. Octane 2.0: Google's JavaScript benchmark also includes scenario testing for today's interactive web applications. Octane is not Chrome-specific. For example, it tests how fast Microsoft's TypeScript compiles itself. In this benchmark, the higher the score, the better. Google may have wrote this benchmark, but Opera won it with a score of 40,356. Chrome couldn't even take second. Second place with 38,806 went to Edge. Chrome was right on its heels with 38,352, and Firefox took the fourth spot with 35,650. IE once more failed to complete the test. This time it couldn't complete Mozilla's zlib test. This is an old benchmark from the Emscripten suite, which times LLVM-to-JavaScript compiling. Even without completing a full run, IE still came in far, far behind the others with a score of 19.926. WebXPRT is my favorite browser benchmark. It's produced by the good people at Principled Technology who specialize in benchmarking. That's none too surprising since its senior staff were the founders of the Ziff Davis Benchmark Operation, the gold-standard of PC benchmarking. WebXPRT 2015 uses scenarios created to mirror every day tasks. It contains six HTML5 and JavaScript-based workloads: Photo Enhancement, Organize Album, Stock Option Pricing, Local Notes, Sales Graphs, and Explore DNA Sequencing. Here, the higher the score, the better the browser. Edge once again took the blue ribbon with a score of 466. Nipping at its heels was Chrome with 444. Opera was right behind in third with 424 points, while Firefox came next with 416. And IE came in last again with 335. HTML5 Test: Finally, I checked to see how well each browser complies with the HTML5 web standard. This "test" isn't a benchmark. It just shows how close each browser comes to being in sync with the HTML5 standard. A perfect score, which no one got, would have been 550. Chrome took home the gold by a nose over Opera, 519 to 516. Edge came in third with a score of 460 and Firefox placed fourth with 416. Way, way back, once more, was IE -- 312. Looking purely at the scores, one thing pops out immediately. IE 11 on Windows 10 is awful. I've found IE annoying as a web browser since day one when IE was born as a spinoff from Spyglass. I, and many others, were also glad IE 6 finally died long after it became more of an annoyance than a web browser. But, with two failures to run basic tests, it appears that Microsoft is putting IE in for early retirement. Microsoft Edge, on the other hand, runs much better than it ever has before for me. Edge took the blue ribbon in both JetStream and WebXPRT. If performance were the only criteria, I'd give Edge the win. It's not. For example, I use extensions a lot. On Chrome, my main browser on all platforms, I use over a dozen extensions every day. They allow me to search through a site using Google, invoke the ZenMate virtual private network (VPN), and save pages to Google Drive. Edge finally supports extensions, but instead of thousands, Edge supports a mere 22. That's not good enough. Opera, which has been slowly dropping in popularity for years, actually shows up quite well in my tests. For the first time in ages, Opera won two of the benchmarks, Kraken and Octane. It may be time to give Opera another look. Firefox has been declining in both popularity and speed for some time now. I see no reason for this changing in this go-around. Chrome, once unquestionably the fastest of the fast, has fallen behind both Edge and Opera. While its HTML5 support is still superb, Google needs to retune it for greater speed. So, which is the best? To me, it comes down to Chrome, Edge, or Opera. Since I want one browser for all the operating systems I run and a lot of extensions, Chrome's my choice. But if pure speed is what you want, Edge or Opera are both good choices.

If you zoom out though, you see AWS is building a complete stack that can help it land enterprise deals and mute Microsoft and Google's advantage with Office 365 and Gmail, respectively. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | February 14, 2017 -- 14:04 GMT (06:04 PST) | Topic: Cloud Amazon Web Services move to enter the Web conferencing business highlights how the company is moving up the cloud services stack and aiming to somewhat nullify the competitive advantages of Microsoft, Google and IBM. Cloud TV How business leaders are embracing cloud services The cloud is disrupting traditional operating models for IT departments and entire organizations. Read More On Tuesday, AWS launched Chime, a unified communication service that'll compete with Cisco's WebEx, Microsoft's Skype for Business and a host of other tools such as Go-To-Meeting. Chime has a free basic edition, a Plus Edition for $2.50 a month and a Pro Edition for $15 a month. Chime joins WorkDocs and WorkMail as long-tail productivity plays.

AWS is Amazon's most profitable business by far. However, infrastructure as a service is a commodity game and AWS has moved up the stack to offer more high value clouds. As AWS has moved up, it has become competition for companies like Oracle (databases), Microsoft (active directory), Google and IBM (artificial intelligence and machine learning). The catch here is that Google and Microsoft have a competitive advantage that AWS to date has lacked--productivity apps and software-as-a-service plays. Consider AWS' playing field: Microsoft talks about Azure's capabilities, but it's highly likely that its commercial cloud revenue is dominated by Office 365. Companies buy Office 365 and likely bridge over to Azure. Active Directory is a gateway drug to Azure. Google took it's sweet time combining its Google Cloud productivity footprint--Gmail, Apps, Drive etc.--but now has aligned it with its infrastructure stack. Like Microsoft, Google can use its productivity footprint to sell infrastructure cloud services. IBM Cloud can be lined up with its software-as-a-service portfolio and notably Watson. Oracle has infrastructure and platform cloud services, but we all know that's just table stakes to sell you its ERP, database and data cloud products. AWS has come from the other direction, but fits in with all those Clay Christensen innovation models. Company enters market with pricing and value products and eventually moves up the value chain to be a luxury brand. Think Toyota/Lexus and Honda/Acura over the decades. From an art-of-war perspective, AWS' Chime--and other productivity apps such as WorkMail--may also be about making Google and Microsoft defend their real cloud cash cows and taking their eyes off of infrastructure as a service. Google's enterprise Gmail made Microsoft improve Office in the cloud and possibly lay off its search fascination a bit. Here's a look at where business productivity sits in the AWS universe. Will front-end app approach for AWS pay off? Possibly, but it'll take time. AWS is really looking for more tools to do bulk enterprise sales. Business productivity can help that cause. Keep in mind VMware once got into front-end productivity apps and retreated. In AWS' case the business productivity play is merely part of a broader product portfolio plan. Chime, WorkDocs and WorkMail don't have to be massive hits.

Secondary Menu Home About Categories bbPress Blogging BuddyPress Events ICYMI News Plugins Polls Themes WordPress Weekly WordPress Contributors Podcast Comment Policy Contact Us Search for: Home News WordPress REST API Vulnerability Exploits Continue WordPress REST API Vulnerability Exploits Continue Sarah Gooding February 13, 2017 24 photo credit: Code & Martini by Ivana Vasilj ‚Äì cc license It has been nearly two weeks since the WordPress security team disclosed an unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability in a REST API endpoint in 4.7 and 4.7.1. The vulnerability was patched silently and disclosure was delayed for a week to give WordPress site owners a head start on updating to 4.7.2. Last week hundreds of thousands of vulnerable sites had already been defaced and the damage reports are still rolling in. Over the weekend the attacks increased and WordPress security firms have seen more attempts blocked by their firewalls. Sucuri, the website security firm that reported the vulnerability to WordPress, was tracking the ‚ÄúHacked by w4l3XzY3‚Äù campaign last week and estimated 66,000 defacements. That particular campaign has now passed 260,000 pages indexed by Google. It is one of nearly two dozen defacement campaigns targeting the vulnerability. ‚ÄúDuring the past 24 hours we have seen an average growth in defaced pages per campaign of 44%,‚Äù Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder said on Friday. ‚ÄúThe total number of defaced pages for all these campaigns, as indexed by Google has grown from 1,496,020 to 1,893,690. That is a 26% increase in total defaced pages in just 24 hours.‚Äù Maunder referenced a Google Trends chart which he said demonstrates the success the defacement campaigns have had over the past week. The spike began on the day WordPress disclosed the vulnerability. However, White Fir Design, another company that offers security services, disputes Wordfence‚Äôs claims that 1.8 million pages were hacked. The ~2 million pages figure is cited in reports from BBC, The Enquirer, Ars Technica, CIO.com, and other publications. White Fir Design contends that the hacked pages that have been indexed by Google are not an accurate representation. Sucuri CTO Daniel Cid also does not fully agree with Wordfence‚Äôs assessment of the situation. After doing some research over the weekend, Sucuri estimates more than 50,000 sites hacked with 20-30 pages per site defaced. This would be roughly a million on the lower end of the estimate and ranges up to 1.5 million. Sucuri is also starting to see more serious attempts on the REST API vulnerability in the form of remote code execution (RCE) attacks on sites using plugins that allow for PHP execution from within posts and pages. One such campaign attempts to inject a PHP include to add content from a compromised site and then inject a backdoor hidden in /wp-content/uploads. ‚ÄúDefacements don‚Äôt offer economic returns, so that will likely die soon,‚Äù Cid said. ‚ÄúWhat will remain are attempts to execute commands (RCE) as it gives the attackers full control of a site ‚Äì and offers multiple ways to monetize ‚Äì and SPAM SEO / affiliate link / ad injections. We are starting to see them being attempted on a few sites, and that will likely be the direction this vulnerability will be misused in the coming days, weeks and possibly months.‚Äù Hackers are targeting any sites that haven‚Äôt updated to 4.7.2 ‚Äì there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any pattern among them. A quick look at the Google results for the most active campaigns shows that compromised sites include blogs, media, government, education, sports, medical, and technology websites. Why the REST API is Enabled by Default The WordPress REST API is enabled by default, as the plan is for more admin and plugin functionality to rely on the REST API in the future. After the recent attacks, several users commented on the vulnerability disclosure to ask why it is enabled by default. ‚ÄúThe security issue is in a feature I do not use on any of my sites (REST API) and yet still, this feature is first enabled by default and second since WordPress 4.7 you even need a plugin ‚Äì which could introduce further security issues ‚Äì to disable the feature?‚Äù one user (@helios2121) commented on the post. ‚ÄúPlease rethink your approach to security. Make features that not everyone needs opt-in. Or at least give a way to opt out without requiring additional plugins.‚Äù Morten Rand-Hendriksen opened a trac ticket to discuss disabling the REST API by default and only enabling it when the site admin requests it, or a theme or plugin is dependent on it. Core Committer Sergey Biryukov‚ÄÇconfirmed that the plan is to introduce more core functionality that relies on REST API. ‚ÄúTurning off the REST API is like turning off admin-ajax.php ‚Äî both will break your site,‚Äù Biryukov said. Rand-Hendriksen asked why the content endpoints cannot be protected by default while allowing the REST API to be on by default for admin purposes. Another user asked why the Users endpoint isn‚Äôt protected by default (i.e. https://news.microsoft.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users or https://www.obama.org/wp-json/wp/v2/users), which ‚Äúmakes it easier than ever to get all the usernames‚Äù on any site using 4.7+. ‚ÄúIf you really want to disable the REST API on your site(s), this is our current recommendation: restrict it to authenticated users,‚Äù Core Committer James Nylen said. ‚ÄúHowever, we want to continue to increase adoption and usage of the REST API, and I expect that even this modification will break more and more WP functionality as time goes on, such as API-driven themes and embeds.‚Äù Nylen recommends the Disable JSON API plugin for those who want to follow that recommendation on sites using WordPress 4.7+. The plugin currently has more than 10,000 active installs. The WordPress security team worked diligently to mitigate the attacks by helping hosts and security firms put protections in place before the issue was made public. However, the full disclosure of the vulnerability was buried on the Make/Core blog, a site that is not widely read among regular WordPress site owners. The link to the disclosure was published as an addendum to the previous post on the WordPress news blog a week later. ‚ÄúWhile I appreciate the responsible disclosure of this issue and the effort to resolve it, I hope you consider making future announcements via a new post on the WordPress News site, rather than just appending an update to a previous post,‚Äù user @johnrork commented on the official disclosure. ‚ÄúI am probably not the only one who could have avoided being compromised had this shown up as a new item in my RSS reader on Wednesday.‚Äù Those who read the Make blogs had a head start on fixing their own sites and/or their clients‚Äô sites. Those who depend on the WordPress news blog for information on security updates probably read the post when it was initially published and never returned to see the update a week later. An issue this severe warranted WordPress‚Äô transparency in a new post on its news blog. This would have also automatically sent out a tweet to more than half a million followers on the official WordPress account and the Facebook account which has more than a million likes. Fortunately, the number of vulnerable sites that also have plugins that could allow attackers to piggyback on this vulnerability is a much smaller number. Defaced sites are embarrassing but easy to fix. In most cases administrators need only update to 4.7.2 and roll back the defaced posts to the most recent revision. Most site owners have no idea how fast exploits begin to pop up after public disclosure, but this situation provided a gentle reminder of the importance of updating WordPress and the benefit of leaving automatic updates on.

On the flip side, if you pay them too much, they might also leave, though that's not typically a problem. It was for Google, however, which implemented an unusual and highly lucrative (for employees) pay system for its self-driving car division that led to top talent calling it quits. In the early days, Google implemented a compensation system that awarded employees with huge monetary incentives based on the project's value. It did not take long for the project to ramp up and accumulate significant value, which in turn made the division's employees wealthy. Several of them chose to cash in their promised payouts and then leave the company. The system started in 2010 not long after Google unveiled its first self-driving cars. Employees were given cash salaries, but some also received bonuses and ownership stake in the business. Google set these awards aside in a special entity. By 2015, Google's self-driving car program had grown fairly large. Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and began paying it out, sometimes giving employees every last nickel that was set aside. With these sizable payouts now in hand, veteran employees were no long motivated by job security. Some of them chose to collect their mega bonuses, or "F-you money" as they referred to it, and then seek opportunities elsewhere. In some cases, they were finally able to create or invest in a startup that interested them with their newfound financial freedom. As ironic as it seems, Google overpaid to the point where its employees no longer felt obliged to stick with the project. As a result, Google lost a lot of top-level talent right as its self-driving car program was gaining steam. The multiplier that was applied to the value of awards was based on periodic evaluations of the division. It's not known what exact metrics or benchmarks were used, but in one case, a project member racked up a multiplier of 16 over the course of four years. These large multipliers resulted in multi-million dollar payouts. Where Google erred wasn't necessarily in offering large compensation packages, but perhaps paying them out too early. The payouts grew substantially after reaching certain milestones, but the end goal of selling fully autonomous vehicles was still years away when the payouts were made. Things are different now. Google's self-driving car division is now a standalone business called Waymo with a pay structure that treats all employees the same. The focus has also changed, with Google now looking to work with existing automakers to implement self-driving technologies and features into cars rather than build out its own fleet.

Why you should start using Google Keep right away Digital nomad survival tips you can use anywhere (Part 2) Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price Google is moving to make Maps more than just about getting to your destination. Maps is getting social. Zach Maier, a product manager with Google Maps, announced in a blog post Monday that users can create lists of their favorite places, places they want to visit and share those lists with friends within the app. "Starting today, you can create lists of places, share your lists with others, and follow the lists your friends and family share with you -- without ever leaving the Google Maps app," Maier said. To make Maps a social tool, users open the app on either the iPhone or Android platform and then tap on, say, a restaurant, museum or club. Tap on the Save icon and it will add the spot to one of several pre-set lists, such as Want to Go or Favorites, according to Maier. Users also can create their own lists. To find their lists, people can go to Your Places on the side menu of Maps and open the Saved tab. Maps' new feature also is designed to show your saved places on the map itself. "Because sharing is caring, we made it easy to share lists like "Best Views in SF" via text, email, social networks and popular messaging apps," noted Maier. "Whenever friends and family come to town, tap the share button to get a link and start flexing your local knowledge muscles. Once you send a link to your out-of-towners, they can tap "Follow" to pull up the list from Your Places whenever they need it." According to Google, the lists can be seen and shared on mobile devices and desktop computers. Users also can download the maps to use when they're offline. The new feature is another step in social media for Google, which has struggled to bust into the social media world. Google+, the company's rival social network competing with Facebook and Twitter, wasn't the hit the company had hoped for. Google seems to be taking a different tack now, taking one of its most popular apps and making it social. "This is a dramatically different way of them approaching social," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. "Instead of starting big and horizontal like Google+, they're starting small. It's a very different tack, but worth a try. Google's horizontal approach hasn't worked so far." Going social with Maps, which so many people use, may be an easier way to get people sharing destinations with friends. And that would mean more eyes and more time on a Google product. "Google has an excellent Maps product," added Moorhead. "People want to know if their friends like or have been at a certain place and trust their friends more than anyone else. Therefore, I think this has a chance." To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

The tech giant‚Äôs local effort to train the next generation of technology innovators through a programme called Code in the Community will kick off next weekend, with up to 48 classes held across four community centres ‚Äì Canberra Zone 7 RC, Henderson CC, Hong Kah North CC and the Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda) headquarters ‚Äì for children aged 8 to 15. Classes will each be an hour long, and will take place across two 10-week-long terms. The first batch of students will complete their programme by Sept¬†3. By the end of the 20-week programme, 8 to 11-year-olds will, among other tasks, be able to recreate a frogger-style arcade game and develop a search game to hunt for hidden treasure through an interactive software programme called Scratch. Twelve to 15-year-olds will learn to code using Python, a widely used high-level programming language, giving them a taste of computer science and the computational thinking, sequential planning and logical reasoning skills required. The classes will be conducted by 21C Girls ‚Äî a registered charity that develops and delivers free coding classes to girls in Singapore ‚Äì and Saturday Kids, a programming school for children here. The curriculum also includes a visit to the Google Singapore office where children and their parents will meet Googlers, and learn about the work engineers there do every day. ‚ÄúWe hope this helps diverse young Singaporeans to develop computational/computer science skills and inspire them ‚Äì and their parents ‚Äì to pursue a future career in technology,‚Äù said a Google Singapore spokesperson. The programme was announced in November last year during the launch of Google‚Äôs new Singapore office at Mapletree Business City in Pasir Panjang. In three years, Google aims to benefit 3,000 children from needy homes through the programme. Only low family income beneficiaries at Chinese Development Assistance Council, Eurasian Association, Sinda or Yayasan Mendaki, or of the MOE financial aid scheme, are eligible to be part of the programme. Interested parties who are not beneficiaries will have to be means tested at the self-help groups if they would like to be part of the programme. When asked about the number of sign-ups so far, the Google spokesperson did not disclose a number but said the ‚Äúresponse has been encouraging‚Äù and the company ‚Äúwill continue to build awareness‚Äù for the programme hoping ‚Äúmore Singaporeans will benefit from the programme over the next few months‚Äù. 21C Girls founder Ayesha Khanna told TODAY that the coding classes could be ‚Äúas important as doing math and reading‚Äù as machines are a part of everyday life as well. Instead of getting intimidated by technology, the coding classes will children understand how machines work, and thus ‚Äúhelp build creative confidence‚Äù to tackle 21st century problems, said Ms Khanna. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You ¬† More Stories For You The Most Singapore READ COMMENTED ‚ÄúGood progress‚Äù made in containing oil spillage after recent collisions ‚ÄúBedding-in‚Äù period of several months to be expected for DTL2: Khaw ‚ÄòYou have made Singapore very proud today‚Äô: PM Lee to Yip Pin Xiu ‚ÄòWrecked dorm‚Äô videos an isolated incident: SCDF ‚ÄòWind corridors‚Äô for future Marina South residents ‚ÄòToo soon‚Äô to call property market recovery despite renewed interest: Redas president ‚ÄòSmarter‚Äô regulation needed to embrace disruption ‚ÄòI heard a loud crack, then the tree came hurtling towards me‚Äô Yale-NUS holds townhall over concerns about ‚Äòtroubling‚Äô developments Woodlands murder: Suspect remanded for 3 more weeks for psychiatric evaluation Woodlands businesses brace for more bad times as road charge kicks in Woman scammed of S$40,200 by fake online romeo Woman killed by tree ‚Äòa rising star‚Äô in Mastercard Woman in intensive care after being hit by falling tree in car park Woman hit by tree in Yuan Ching no longer in ICU, condition stable Inside Today World Kim Jong Un cements power in North Korea‚Äôs Game of Thrones Indonesia trying to verify if citizen involved in Kim death North Koreans, in eye of storm, fete leader‚Äôs birthday Malaysia pledges to return Kim body after autopsy, police makes third arrest Poison‚Äôs long history as murder weapon Business Austria to sue Airbus over suspected Eurofighter fraud: APA news agency SMBC head says will give Toshiba as much support as possible GM's Opel, Peugeot lagging rivals in strong European market: ACEA Snap sets valuation at lower end of expectation: WSJ Newspapers aim to ride 'Trump Bump' to reach readers, advertisers Sports Once Asia's footballing pride, Myanmar's prolonged slide in the sport continues Aussie swimming great Grant Hackett goes missing, described as 'mentally disturbed' Shanghai SIPG sign ex-Madrid defender Carvalho STTA overhauls annual awards, with axed paddler Feng Tianwei missing out Madrid police talk to Maradona after altercation at hotel Entertainment Fresh Off The Boat star in negotiations for lead role in Crazy Rich Asians movie, set in Singapore 10 S‚Äôpore singers, actors and comedians want to Car-aoke with you Moby claims he has intel on Trump administration and Russia Guns ‚ÄòN Roses sorry over Aussie city mix-up Without big YouTube star, Google faces setback in content plans About TODAY Apps RSS Sitemap Syndication Contact Us Advertise with Us Terms & Conditions About MediaCorp Copyright 2017 ¬© Mediacorp Press Ltd.

But this year, analysts, insiders, and commentators appear to think that the next iteration could make up for the disappointment.¬†Fast Company, ranking Apple as the fourth most innovative firm in the world, argues that the company's increased focus on building chips in-house will allow it to create "the most compelling consumer-electronics experiences." Our own Will Knight explains that Siri could be getting a shot in the arm, by learning from its mistakes. And the rumor mill predicts a slew of new iPhone features, including wireless charging, curved screens, and superior battery life. That buzz, combined with stronger-than-expected iPhone sales over the holidays, saw Apple stock reach an all-time high at the close of the markets yesterday. It remains to be seen, of course, whether the bluster amounts to much. Do you need The Download? Sign up here¬†to get it for free in your inbox. Imagining the Future of VR Storytelling at Google Jessica Brillhart is the principal filmmaker for virtual reality at Google. But what, exactly, does that mean? In an interview with our editor in chief, Jason Pontin, she explains that she gets to explore how everything from exotic 16-camera rigs to cheap cardboard headsets could be used to provide new experiences that traditional film cannot. It may sound like one of the more cushy and creative Silicon Valley jobs, but it poses some challenging puzzles. ‚ÄúVR is an embodied medium: creators are taking [a] detached eye and reattaching it to someone‚Äôs face,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúVR reminds us of the nuances of experiences, what connects people with each other, with places, with things in the real world. And that to me is the key to really understanding what kind of storytelling could even exist in a VR space.‚Äù Converting Climate Change Deniers There‚Äôs an ever-growing base of evidence to support the fact that humans cause climate change‚Äîand it's (slowly) nudging public acceptance of the phenomenon to increase. The results of global warming are manifest around the planet. The 700-foot high Oroville Dam currently teeters on the brink of disaster, with a climate-exacerbated double blow of drought and flood causing operators to use its emergency slipways and evacuate nearly 200,000 people. Sea ice levels have hit record lows at both poles. And in Australia, longer heat waves are causing increased bushfire risk. A new equation suggests that humans are causing the climate to change 170 times faster than natural forces. And, in the UK at least, people are willing to believe it: more people than ever there now believe that climate change is real. How long until the new White House administration follows suit? Ten Fascinating Things What lurks in the ocean‚Äôs deepest reaches? According to a new study of the Pacific's Kermadec and Mariana trenches, high levels of chemicals that were banned in the 1970s. Researchers claim that levels of contamination are similar to the most polluted industrial areas of the northwest Pacific. Four weeks ago, 20 percent of Cameroon's population found their Internet blocked‚Äîand it remains the case. Affecting just English-speaking parts of the country, it‚Äôs believed to be politically motivated. It ought stop: the ban will be hurting the country‚Äôs economy. Researchers have used pottery from the ancient Judean people to show that Earth‚Äôs magnetic field briefly spiked to nearly twice its current intensity¬†in the 8th Century BC. If correct, a similar event could wreak havoc with modern technology.¬† Ever since Uber conceded the Chinese market, it‚Äôs shifted its Asian attentions to India. But now it, and large homegrown rival, Ola, have a problem: thousands of drivers in New Delhi¬†have gone on strike for four days, demanding better pay. Watch out, Skype: Amazon is after you. The e-tailer has announced¬†Chime, which will host video conferences and live-share documents on its servers. It may sound ten years late, but Amazon is¬†targeting the businesses sector‚Äîwhich, as many of us know, remains lacking. Over the last year, Google‚Äôs self-driving car project haemorrhaged staff‚Äîincluding its technical lead. New reports suggest that the exodus was the result of a pay structure where early staffers received¬†so much money that they had little incentive to stay. In many parts of the world, humid conditions can lead to loss of crops via rot and fungal toxins. A new kind of ceramic bead sucks moisture out of the air and could make the process of drying crops twice as energy efficient. Tens of thousands of Americans die in hospital every year because of preventable causes. Joe Kiani, head of medical device firm Masimo, hopes to reduce that number by having medical devices communicate on a single, open platform.¬† Nutritionists make foods healthy by sucking salt, sugar, and fat out‚Äîoften at the expense of taste. But what if we could fool our brain into believing that the results taste like the junk we love? We may be able to, by tweaking the texture of food. Triangulene sounds like it could be the potent foe of a superhero. But it‚Äôs actually an¬†exotic molecule that IBM researchers have built by moving single atoms at a time. Quote of the Day "Over time I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence ‚Ä¶ It's mostly about bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself.‚Äù ‚Äî Elon Musk thinks that, in a future filled with robots, humans will need to create a direct link with computers to move information around fast enough if they plan to keep up.

By Dom Nicastro | Feb 14, 2017 CHANNEL: Digital Workplace We continue our What‚Äôs in a Name? series with tech companies Bioz, Datical and Vena Solutions.¬† One claims it can be the Google of the life sciences research arena. Another was named by Gartner¬†as a cool vendor in IT automation. The other is coming off a $30 million funding round last year for its cloud-based corporate performance management solution. Bioz Year founded: 2013 Headquarters: Palo Alto, Calif. Co-founders: Karin Lachmi (president and chief scientific officer) and Daniel Levitt (CEO). Lachmi won a silver Stevie Award last fall for Female Entrepreneur of the Year for in business products category for businesses with less than 10 employees.¬† Karin Lachmi Specializes in: Bioz offers a search engine for life science experimentation. The patent-pending software platform combines the work of scientists with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to help life scientists in academia and biopharma make experimentation decisions. Was this the original company name? No, the original name was PTENlab. Who named the company? Naming the company was the result of a team effort and brainstorm session where the founding employees came into agreement that Bioz best reflected our company values and mission. How and why did the company take on this name? We wanted something short and catchy, that was easy to remember and also related to biology and life sciences, since that is the space our technology serves. Additionally, we wanted the name to easily be turned into a verb. If a user wants to look up an antibody on our search engine for their research, they can go to the website and ‚Äúbioz it,‚Äù much like how people use the term ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù when saying they want to look something up online.¬† Bioz is also a simple enough name that it is easily built upon for future products and offerings. Additionally, we‚Äôve found that companies with a ‚Äúz‚Äù in the name makes it stand out and easier to remember from the rest of the pack, so Bioz seemed like the perfect choice. What names did you consider before choosing your company name, and why were they not chosen? Our original company name was PTENLab, inspired by the PTEN protein. However, for a company name it was too long and hard to pronounce, and didn‚Äôt evoke the same catchiness as Bioz. What tech companies do you admire or envy, and why? As stated, we were inspired by companies like Google that were able to inspire users to turn the name into a verb, which reflects its dominance in the industry and how widespread its influence is. Datical Year founded: 2012 Headquarters: Austin, Texas Number of employees: 50 Specializes in: Datical‚Äôs mission is to simplify the application release process by automating database deployments. It specializes in providing solutions that deliver database automation capabilities for agile, DevOps and continuous delivery investments.¬† CEO: Derek Hutson Derek Hutson Was this the original name? Absolutely. Who named the company? Robert Reeves, CTO.¬† How and why did the company take on this name? We absolutely needed something that referred to data and our approach. So, we found something that started with ‚Äúdat‚Äù and rhymed with ‚Äúradical.‚Äù What names did you consider before choosing your company‚Äôs name, and why were they not chosen? ‚ÄúI was really pulling for ReevesSoft, but the other co-founders didn‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt know why,‚Äù Reeves said.¬† Other options were YourDatabaseIsGoingToDie.com and WhyCantYouSpendMoreTimeWithYourFamily.com. Seriously, early startups tend to be a bit edgier. What tech company names do you admire or envy and why? We don‚Äôt envy at Datical. If we see others doing something we like, we simply duplicate it. ‚ÄúGood artists borrow, great artists steal.‚Äù¬† A company we admire is Amazon, specifically how they built AWS. They started it by using it internally; they had no intentions to sell it. It was just the right thing to do. Driven by Jeff Bezos‚Äô API mandate memo (which Amazon CTO Werner Vogels demanded), Amazon had a huge improvement in time-to-market and stability.¬† Once that was in place, they needed extra capacity to handle spikes, but they realized that other companies would buy that capacity when they didn‚Äôt need it. Brilliant. Amazon avoided being Uber‚Äôd by Uber‚Äôing themselves before Uber. Super meta. Vena Solutions Year founded: 2011 Headquarters: New York and Toronto Number of employees: 200 Specializes in: Vena Solutions, which raised $30 million in funding last year, turns Excel into an enterprise-class business solution with a centralized database, workflow, audit trail and more. Our technology is used for corporate performance management (CPM) applications, including budgeting, financial close management, reporting and automating other spreadsheet-driven processes across and beyond finance.¬† George Papayiannis We were founded on the belief that the technologies people know and love should always play a vital role in the way companies plan and measure the way they do business. We‚Äôve turned loved products like Excel, Office 365 and Google Docs into an enterprise-class business solution with workflow, data warehousing and more. Co-founders: Rishi Grover,¬†Don Mal¬†and George Papayiannis.¬† CEO: Don Mal. Was this the original name? Yes, Vena Solutions was the original and only name for the company. Who named the company? Vena was named by co-founders Papayiannis and Grover.¬† How and why did the company take on this name? We sought a name reflecting the value propositions of our core solutions, without being so direct. To achieve this, we made a list of our solution‚Äôs benefits in a generic sense, and looked for names that we thought represented us well as a company. The keywords we searched included: process improvement, streamline, workflow and high data integrity.¬† We settled on ‚ÄúVena,‚Äù from Greek and Latin, which translates to ‚Äústream‚Äù in English. Our solution helps companies streamline their most critical business processes, so the name was perfect. Vena also means ‚Äúvein,‚Äù which fits perfectly with the way our solution handles data (the lifeblood of business), ensuring its effective flow. What tech company names do you admire or envy and why? Company names that we admire are those that are simple, yet non-direct regarding the market they are in. Names that are easily pronounced and can be marketed well.¬† But also names that are intriguing to make you want to understand the story behind the name. Apple is a great example, an apple as the perfect fruit, in a perfect package and delivering high nutrients. Very inspiring and definitely thinking outside the box. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Microsoft Integrates Power BI in SharePoint Online Forrester Analyst: PaaS a ‚ÄòRevolution‚Äô for Web Content Management AI-Fueled Storytelling Takes Customer Experience to the Next Level How Machine Learning Uncovers Hidden Correlations for Marketers Customer Loyalty Is Based on the Little Things Bioz, Datical, Vena Solutions: What's in a Name?

DOWNLOAD Autonomous Self Driving Car Leaders Reveal Why Drivers Revert To Manual February 14, 2017February 14, 2017 by Kiril Kirilov 28shares Autonomous cars Autonomous cars covered over 640,000 test miles on Californian roads in 2015. Eleven developers released car testing reports. Google‚Äôs Waymo completed 636,000 miles. GM‚Äôs Cruise, Nissan, and Delphi covered over 3000 miles. Others included VW/Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Tesla, Bosch, BMW, Honda, and Ford. All reports show similar reasons why drivers take manual control ‚Äì an event known as ‚Äòdisengagement‚Äô or ‚ÄòDE‚Äô in the trade. The accumulated reports were released by the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles. Streetwise or not? The summarised reports show that complex road situations on urban streets provided the most common reasons for test engineers to grab the wheel. This included traversing roadworks, changing lanes, and overtaking. Google‚Äôs car, which was tested most extensively, most often reverted to manual when about to perform unexpected and unwanted manoeuvres, or as a remedy for apparent software discrepancies. It is laudable that companies like Google prefer to test their autonomous vehicles in complex urban environments, rather than on more straightforward freeways. Some 89 percent of all Google disengagements were in cities. Less laudably, the reasons for disengagement raise concerns about how well autonomous cars‚Äô software and sensors cope with urban conditions. Autonomous car disengagements Miles covered Miles per disengagement in 2015 Common causes Waymo (Google) 635,868 1244.4 Software discrepancy; unwanted vehicle manoeuvre VW/Audi N/A 74.8 N/A Mercedes-Benz 673.4 1.8 Driver discomfort; planned technology tests Delphi 3125.3 41.9 Changing lanes in heavy traffic; traffic light detection Tesla Motors 550 N/A Invalid planner or follower output Bosch 983 1.5 Planned technology tests Nissan 4099 14 System failure; imminent collision Cruise (GM) 9846.5 N/A Remedying unexpected behaviour BMW 638 N/A Unclear lane markings Honda N/A N/A N/A Ford 590 N/A Aborted lane change during high speed overtaking Comparing apples and oranges The Google report reveals that, of 69 reported safe operation events in 2015, 13 were simulated contacts. In plain language this means the vehicle was on its way to collide with another object unless the driver had taken manual control. The other 56 events could also have led to contact with another object, though less imminently. The figures show that autonomous cars still require close supervision by a human driver. To be fair, research needs to provide comparisons with manually driven cars. Any such research would be untenable, however, as it would compare the proverbial apples with oranges. Human thought processes are intrinsically unsuitable for comparison with the algorithms that operate autonomous cars. A researcher can collect, assess, and analyse data on both human driven and autonomous cars, but cannot correctly address factors like emotion, intuition, or human experience accumulated over eons of evolution. An experienced driver can anticipate the behaviour of a car in the adjacent lane fairly quickly. Algorithms are still a long way from being able to do so. This is reflected in Google‚Äôs disengagements figures. Between September 2014 and November 2015 ‚Äòperception discrepancy‚Äô caused 199 disengagements. Next came software discrepancy, with 80 events. Hardware issues aside, there were 55 disengagements because the car began to manoeuvre in unexpected ways, and 23 to accommodate reckless behaviour by other road users. Ready for adoption: not yet The reports in effect reveal that autonomous vehicles cannot yet handle complex road situations and are apt to make unexpected moves that are potentially dangerous for their occupants and other road users. A commonly cited complex situation involves roadworks. These feature multiple and diverse road signs and instructions, which can totally overcome self driving cars‚Äô control algorithms. As any driver knows all too well, roadworks are very common. Yet, it emerges that no programmed autonomous driving solution can cope with them at the moment. The only scenario that would work is fairly utopian. It involves only autonomous cars, each with fully compatible sensors, and each able to communicate and with all the others, instantly. It would be unkind to state that autonomous car research to date has resulted in something akin to air traffic control or railway signalling. Other constraints to autonomous car adoption include allowances for emergency vehicles and the cars‚Äô current inability to anticipate other road users‚Äô moves. An accumulation of more than one such factor could result in a hazardous situation where drivers have to take control. What is more, today‚Äôs state of the art autonomous cars need their derivers to be alert and to second-guess the technology at all times. Parkinson‚Äôs Law states that they would be apt to undertake unexpected manoeuvres exactly when the driver is relaxed or distracted and is thus unable to take the wheel. The incidence of disengagements has fallen significantly over the past year. Google reports 0.8 DAs per thousand miles in 2015 and just 0.2 last year. All the same, the technology is still very much in gestation, and the figures pinpoint the areas all manufacturers ought to take to heart when honing their autonomous cars. By¬†Kiril V.

Amazon likes to say that it focuses on customers, not competitors, which means¬†it‚Äôs¬†rare for the company‚Äôs top executives to¬†talk about¬†their¬†rivals¬†publicly. So a talk by¬†Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy this week at the University of Washington was notable in part for Jassy‚Äôs comments about¬†the competitive landscape in the cloud. Cloud Report Card: Amazon Web Services is a $12B juggernaut, but Microsoft and Google are gaining University of Washington computer science professor Ed Lazowska, who led the discussion, got Jassy going on the topic by asking him¬†for his theories about¬†why Google and Microsoft have taken a¬†different approach than Amazon in the cloud. Jassy went on to address topics including the prospects for¬†Oracle and IBM in the cloud, the battle for cloud enterprise customers, and concerns among customers about vendor lock-in. Continue reading for excerpts from Jassy‚Äôs comments on AWS and the¬†competition, and watch the video above for his full talk at the UW‚Äôs Computer Science & Engineering department. On the two different ‚Äúcategories‚Äù of cloud competitors ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one category of large technology providers, like some of the ones you mentioned, who decided to build an abstraction much further up the stack. I don‚Äôt know exactly why they pursued that. I think some of it might have been just a feeling like the basic building blocks were too basic, that what people really wanted was something much more abstracted.¬†We were very focused in the early days on developers and on startups, and we still remain incredibly focused on them, but we had this perception that they would be the ones who would try the platform first, their alternatives were much worse than enterprises, they tend to start and adopt any new paradigm shift like this was, and that group of people is willing to dig into the details and stitch together the components maybe in a way that enterprises weren‚Äôt as likely to do. So we started there, and we figured that enterprises would choose to have a bunch of people who did that stitching, and then for others who would want abstractions further up, we‚Äôd build the abstractions later when we had that adoption. I think some of the other folks, either because their customer base focus was more enterprise, and/or maybe because they thought the building blocks were too primitive and not interesting enough, started in another spot. ¬†There‚Äôs not going to be one successful player. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs going to be 30.¬†‚Ä¶ ¬†But there are going to be multiple successful players, and who those are is still going to be written. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a second category of large technology companies that just took an ungodly long time to get there. These are companies like Oracle and IBM, some of those folks. I think for them the model that we were pursuing, in the cloud, was so disruptive to their core businesses. The margin structures are radically different. The pricing structures are dramatically different. The delivery model is radically different. The way you take care of customers is radically different. So different that I think you have that dilemma at a lot of large companies: do you really want to try and accelerate the cannibalization of an existing ‚Ä¶ I think that they fought as long and hard as they could. They pooh-poohed it and they said, first no one will use it, then maybe only startups will use it, and they won‚Äôt use it for anything real, then enterprises will never use it, then enterprises will never use it for anything mission-critical. Companies and developers voted with their workloads, and so now they‚Äôre in this spot of trying to spin something up. It‚Äôs six, seven years late.‚Äù Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy, right, speaks with UW computer science professor Ed Lazowska this week in Seattle. (UW via YouTube.) What has surprised AWS as the cloud has evolved ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many things in our business that have been surprises to us. Probably the biggest of which¬†is that it just took so long for the other large technology companies to offer something in this space, but I don‚Äôt think in our wildest dreams we ever thought we‚Äôd have a six- to seven-year head start, especially because we‚Äôre across the lake from another big technology company in that space, and we all know so many people at each other‚Äôs companies. And so, there have been so many surprises, but if you read the document, the stated mental model was that an individual in his or her dorm room or garage would have access to the same cost structure and scalability of infrastructure as the largest companies of the world. To give you an idea back then, we were talking about those largest companies being like, Peoplesoft. We wanted to be part of enabling a thousand flowers to bloom.‚Äù How the competition will shake out ‚ÄúIf you look at the market segments that AWS is addressing, it‚Äôs infrastructure software, hardware, data center services, and then we‚Äôre building software further up the stack, that‚Äôs trillions of dollars globally. There‚Äôs not going to be one successful player. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs going to be 30, because scale really matters here, both with regard to cost structure as well as the breadth of services. But there are going to be multiple successful players, and who those are is still going to be written. But I would expect that several of the older-guard players will have businesses here, as they have large installed enterprise customer bases, and a large salesforce, and things of that sort. There‚Äôs a lot of work those companies have to do to find the type of functionality that you have in AWS today. We have a lot more functionality by a large amount than, whether it‚Äôs Microsoft or really any other provider. For reference, we also have a much larger set of security capabilities and compliance capabilities than you‚Äôll find anywhere else.‚Äù On the competition for enterprise customers Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy at UW this week. (UW via YouTube) ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening is most enterprises are making decisions around, How many companies do I want to use in the cloud? Do I want to move to the cloud? How do I want to do it? How many companies do I want to use? Most are predominantly deciding that they‚Äôre going to use a single provider. Many will have a second provider they use for a relatively small percentage of their workloads, so that they know they can move, should they decide they want to move, but the benefits of being with a single provider ‚Äî around not having to standardize on¬†the lowest common denominator, not having to have your¬†development teams have to be expert on multiple platforms, and then leveraging your buying power across one provider instead of splitting it across two or three ‚Äî are just too great when you actually get into the practicality than to split it across a few. So most are predominantly picking an infrastructure provider, and a lot of what matters to them at the end of the day is the breadth of capability that‚Äôs there, because it not only allows them to build any new application or idea they have, but most of them are looking to migrate their existing applications over the next few years, and having the right tool for the right job allows you to be much more cost-effective and agile, which is what a lot of them are trying to do.‚Äù On the risks of getting¬†‚Äúlocked in‚Äù to one cloud provider ‚ÄúCustomers will always be nervous about lock-in, and I think the experience they had particularly with a company like Oracle, where it‚Äôs a really hard thing to get out of, and they‚Äôre so hostile to their customers, that I think it‚Äôs a concern for every enterprise. Almost always when I talk to enterprises about lock-in, that‚Äôs the example that they cite. They worry that they‚Äôre going to use a platform and suddenly start raising prices ‚Äî even though we‚Äôve lowered prices on 59 different occasions with no competitive pressure to do so in the last eight years ‚Äî they‚Äôre going to always be sensitive about that, and they should be thoughtful about it. But the reality is it‚Äôs so much easier to move from the infrastructure, cloud computing platforms than it is from something like Oracle. The APIs look pretty similar. All the migration services we build allow people to move to us, or away from us, and back on prem, if that‚Äôs what they want to do. And the business model is different, where we‚Äôre not signing these five- to 10-year unlimited licensing agreements and then finding ways to audit people and keep them in the loop. They can leave whenever they want, and we know we have to earn the business every hour, every day, every week of the year.‚Äù More from the UW CSE Colloquia series Sponsor Post Salesforce is ready for you.

Twitter Facebook Google lets users get social with Maps Google enables users to share favorite spots, bucket lists on Maps app Sharon Gaudin (Computerworld (US)) 14 February, 2017 08:48 - - - - print email Comments Google is moving to make Maps more than just about getting to your destination. Maps is getting social. Zach Maier, a product manager with Google Maps, announced in a blog post Monday that users can create lists of their favorite places, places they want to visit and share those lists with friends within the app. "Starting today, you can create lists of places, share your lists with others, and follow the lists your friends and family share with you -- without ever leaving the Google Maps app," Maier said. To make Maps a social tool, users open the app on either the iPhone or Android platform and then tap on, say, a restaurant, museum or club. Tap on the Save icon and it will add the spot to one of several pre-set lists, such as Want to Go or Favorites, according to Maier. Users also can create their own lists. To find their lists, people can go to Your Places on the side menu of Maps and open the Saved tab. Maps' new feature also is designed to show your saved places on the map itself. "Because sharing is caring, we made it easy to share lists like "Best Views in SF" via text, email, social networks and popular messaging apps," noted Maier. "Whenever friends and family come to town, tap the share button to get a link and start flexing your local knowledge muscles. Once you send a link to your out-of-towners, they can tap "Follow" to pull up the list from Your Places whenever they need it." According to Google, the lists can be seen and shared on mobile devices and desktop computers. Users also can download the maps to use when they're offline. The new feature is another step in social media for Google, which has struggled to bust into the social media world. Google+, the company's rival social network competing with Facebook and Twitter, wasn't the hit the company had hoped for. Google seems to be taking a different tack now, taking one of its most popular apps and making it social. "This is a dramatically different way of them approaching social," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. "Instead of starting big and horizontal like Google+, they're starting small. It's a very different tack, but worth a try. Google's horizontal approach hasn't worked so far." Going social with Maps, which so many people use, may be an easier way to get people sharing destinations with friends. And that would mean more eyes and more time on a Google product. "Google has an excellent Maps product," added Moorhead. "People want to know if their friends like or have been at a certain place and trust their friends more than anyone else. Therefore, I think this has a chance." 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Twitter Facebook Why Twitter's new anti-harassment tools will fail Twitter's new policies won't solve the harassment problem, and they'll ruin engagement, too twitter-292988_1280-100690460-orig.jpg Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 11 February, 2017 23:01 - - - - print email Comments Twitter is trying to curb harassment. Again. Twitter VP of Engineering Ed Ho this week announced three changes that Twitter believes will end its reputation as a haven for trolls, haters, spammers, misogynists, racists and idiots. Two years ago, Twitter's then-CEO Dick Costolo was quoted in a leaked memo saying that "We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years." [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Twitter's reputation may be hurting its bottom line. The company this week reported its slowest quarter for revenue growth since the company went public. Twitter consistently loses about $100 million per quarter. Advertising is weak. Revenue is down. User growth is flat. Advertisers don't want to be associated with Twitter because it's a bad neighborhood. Harassment is a perennial problem on the network. Companies apparently don't want their brands sandwiched between nuggets of hate speech. (Twitter executives declined to be interviewed for this story.) Sadly, Twitter's changes won't stop harassment. They'll make the problem worse. And they'll make the quality of everyday conversations on Twitter worse, too. I'll tell you why. But first, let's look at Twitter's three new changes. First, Twitter claims it's "taking steps to identify people who have been permanently suspended and stop them from creating new accounts." Twitter won't say what these methods are. Second, Twitter intends to remove tweets by default from search results if they contain "potentially sensitive content" or if they were posted on accounts that have been blocked or muted. However, users have the option to disable this "smart search" and see unfiltered results. Third, Twitter will automatically "collapse" or hide objectionable replies, which include those deemed "abusive" or "low quality." These will be viewable by clicking on a link that says "Show less relevant replies." All this sounds pretty good, until you take a closer look. Why Twitter's changes won't work Twitter is relying in part on software-controlled moderation. This approach is inferior to user moderation. The most effective user moderation is the ability to delete the replies of other users. If you post something on a social network, you should be able to delete any reply to that post from any user for any reason. You can delete replies on Facebook, Google+, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr and every other social network I can think of. Not Twitter. If someone replies to your tweet with something hateful, hurtful or threatening, you can't delete the reply. Trolls love this about Twitter. This is why Twitter has a harassment problem. User moderation works because people are good at knowing when replies are made in bad faith. Their ability to delete replies frustrates trolls, who learn that harassment is futile. Sure, trolls can post hateful comments elsewhere. But without the power to disrupt conversations against the wishes of the person who started the conversation, harassment is futile. Instead of giving users the power to delete replies, Twitter relies on two alternatives: a user reporting system and automated software-based moderation (with help from Twitter staff). The trouble is software can't identify bad replies as well as people can. I learned this fact on Google+. Google may have the industry's best algorithms and artificial intelligence. But even Google's software fails for content moderation. Google has been algorithmically flagging "low quality" replies on Google+ for years. It hides flagged replies by default, and users can reveal them with an obscure "See all comments" menu item, which most users don't know about. I would guess that around 10 percent of high quality replies are flagged as "low quality." And probably an equal number of "low quality" replies are judged as "high quality" and allowed to appear among the other replies. Filtering software just doesn't work that well. For example, I recently posted on Google+ what I call a "Mystery Pic." I post a picture of some technology thing and invite followers to guess what's in the picture. One person guessed: "A pod or a wheel from office chair" -- exactly the kind of reply I was looking for. Google's software flagged that comment as spam and buried it so nobody could see it. Just below that, someone posted a hyphen and nothing else, an incredibly "low quality" reply. Google's software identified that hyphen as a high-quality reply and allowed it to remain. Software simply isn't advanced enough to judge language. Google's automated identification and hiding of "low quality" comments fail, and the result is that Google+ simply isn't as good as it could be. Bad comments appear. Good comments are buried. The same outcome is likely on Twitter. The difference is that on Google+, I can make the effort to correct bad decisions by the software. On Twitter, I can't. When Twitter's systems fail to identify a bad reply, the bad reply will remain. When Twitter's systems bury a good reply, I can see the good reply by clicking on a link. But it will remain buried for other users, thereby degrading the quality of conversation on Twitter. Trolls will figure out how to game the system to avoid being buried. Any kind of system designed to keep motivated people out -- whether they're anti-hacker, anti-spam or, in Twitter's case, anti-harasser -- is essentially an arms race. As Twitter tries to develop better anti-harassment systems, the harassers will learn how to get around them. Compounding Twitter's unwillingness to allow industry-standard user moderation, Twitter resists pseudonymity -- where Twitter knows who you are but the public does not. Twitter users are fully anonymous. That means any so-called "user" might be a bot, a troll paid by the Russian government or a person with 100 accounts. There's usually no way to know. (Researchers last month discovered a network of 350,000 fake user accounts controlled by automated bots that had existed undetected for years.) The anonymity of Twitter users makes me doubt that the company can succeed in their attempt to "identify people who have been permanently suspended and stop them from creating new accounts." How can you "identify people" without, you know, identifying people? And how will Twitter avoid blocking new and legitimate accounts by accident? It gets worse: One of Twitter's new anti-harassment systems itself can be used for harassment. Twitter promises to remove tweets from search results posted by accounts that have been blocked or muted. This is the best thing that ever happened to haters. Now abusers can simply block or mute their victim in an organized effort, or by a single user with dozens of accounts, and thereby remove their victim from search results. Victims may be unaware that abusers have blocked them from search results. Many victims of harassment will be automatically silenced in Twitter search the second this change goes into effect (it's being rolled out over the coming weeks). For example, let's say a woman has been speaking out on Twitter about sexism in video games. And let's say she has attracted haters and has been arguing about it on Twitter for the past two years. No doubt she has been blocked by dozens or hundreds of Twitter users. Now, when the new rules go into effect, her tweets in the past, present and future will be removed from search results. If the haters haven't silenced her yet, Twitter will finish the job. Only three methods can effectively curb out-of-control harassment on social sites: user moderation of comments, user ranking of comments and the disallowance of anonymity. Twitter rejects all three methods, and so chronically suffers from a reputation for harassment. Imagine if Twitter accepted all three. It could be the greatest site on the Internet. Instead, Twitter has now implemented software-controlled moderation and other systems that will reduce the quality of Twitter conversations and silence constructive users. They will be gamed by active trolls and generally result in a lower quality social site. Twitter is in trouble. The company isn't growing, profiting or succeeding. Twitter should be the world's town square, a level playing field that unites everyone in conversation and sharing. Never before has there been a social site so relevant, and at the same time so unsuccessful. Twitter is ruined by its reputation as a hotbed of harassment, trolling and vitriol. And it's so unnecessary. Twitter's refusal to implement user moderation, which would solve the problem overnight at close to zero cost to the company, is business malpractice in the extreme and an abdication of the trust that millions of users have placed in the company. Twitter wants to be great. But the company's leaders simply won't allow that to happen. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Twitter Facebook Forget the network perimeter, say security vendors Google‚Äôs 'BeyondCorp' network security model is starting to influence security offerings Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 15 February, 2017 01:27 - - - - print email Comments What if all your company‚Äôs computers and applications were connected directly to the Internet? That was the assumption behind BeyondCorp, a new model for network security that Google proposed back in 2014, and it‚Äôs one that‚Äôs starting to get some attention from networking and security vendors. Enterprises have moved beyond the traditional workspace in recent years, allowing employees to work remotely by using their personal devices and accessing apps in private or public clouds. To bring roaming workers back into the fold, under the security blanket of their local networks, companies rely on VPNs and endpoint software to enforce network access controls. Google's¬†BeyondCorp¬†approach to enterprise security takes the focus away from the network perimeter and puts it on devices and users. It doesn't assign higher or lower levels of trust to devices based on whether they're inside the internal network or not. Some security vendors have already started to embrace this no-trust-by-default security model. Duo Security, a two-factor authentication provider launched its own BeyondCorp-inspired offering last week, and enterprise software startup¬†ScaleFT has had dynamic access management service based on the same principles for a while. Even networking and security appliance manufacturers like Cisco Systems have begun moving what were traditionally perimeter security gateways into the cloud to better serve roaming employees. Duo Security's new Duo Beyond service consists of a software package that serves as an authentication gateway for all of a company's web-based applications, whether they're hosted inside the local network or in the cloud. It can be deployed in the company network's demilitarized zone (DMZ) and provides a single sign-on service that enforces device and user-based access policies. Duo Beyond assumes a zero-trust environment for all devices by default, regardless of whether they're connecting from within the enterprise network or from the outside. That said, it does provide administrators with the ability to differentiate between corporate devices and personal devices by deploying Duo certificates to those that are managed by the company. This device identification process has several benefits. It allows for the easy discovery of new devices that are used to access corporate applications, which helps companies create and maintain accurate inventories that include employees' personal devices. It also allows restricting access to certain applications or accounts to company-managed devices where a certain degree of security can be guaranteed. The service can also check the security state of a connecting device by looking at whether it's running the latest OS and browser version, whether the browser plug-ins are up to date and, in the case of mobile devices, whether encryption and passcode enforcement are turned on. This allows administrators to create fine-grained access rules based on device "health" and ensure that only reasonably secure devices can access company applications, even if those devices are owned and managed by the employees themselves. Duo Security doesn't expect customers to completely give up on VPNs if they deploy Duo Beyond, but based on the company's experience so far, customers can cut down VPN licensing costs by up to 80 percent. That's because most roaming employees only use VPN connections to access a few popular intranet web applications like Confluence, Jira or Sharepoint. The Duo Beyond service is priced at $9 per user per month and includes everything in the company's older Duo Access service, plus the new certificate-based device identification and the mechanism for controlling which internal apps are accessible by remote users. Moving towards a BeyondCorp security model, where the location of devices does not matter, can help companies avoid having to raise virtual walls inside their networks. Network segmentation, which relies on setting up firewalls and VLANs to restrict access to certain applications and services, is not easy to implement and can quickly become an administrative burden. In fact, as evidenced by many publicly documented security breaches, attackers often succeed in moving laterally inside a network once they break in. Most hackers start with targeting low-level employees through phishing or other methods and then, once inside a network, jump from system to system, exploiting vulnerabilities and stealing access credentials along the way until they reach the organization's crown jewels. Google's own network was breached in late 2009 as part of a cyberespionage campaign of Chinese origin known as Operation Aurora. The hackers, who started by targeting the company's employees, sought access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists. Other security vendors are embracing BeyondCorp too, and, while there are differences in the implementation, the general goal is the same: moving security beyond a strictly defined network perimeter. Duo Beyond works only for web-based applications and its device insight technology is agentless. The information about a laptop's OS, browser and plug-ins is obtained through the browser itself. This approach limits what kind of information can be gathered, but Duo believes that it strikes the right balance between security and usability, since convincing users to install company-mandated software on their personal devices can be problematic. By comparison, another company called ScaleFT provides a BeyondCorp-inspired solution called Dynamic Access Management that works for SSH (Secure Shell) and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), remote access protocols for Linux and Windows servers. ScaleFT's service does requires the installation of client software that synchronizes short-lived access certificates and handles device enrolment and local account creation. Pushed by the need to address the issue of roaming employees, BYOD and software-as-a-service, some networking vendors have even started to move security appliances outside the network perimeter and into the cloud. On Monday, Cisco Systems announced what it calls the first Secure Internet Gateway (SIG), which is based on the cloud-based OpenDNS Umbrella service that the company acquired in 2015. "A SIG provides safe access to the internet anywhere users go, even when they are off the VPN," Cisco said in a blog post. "Before you connect to any destination, a SIG acts as your secure onramp to the internet and provides the first line of defense and inspection. Regardless of where users are located or what they‚Äôre trying to connect to, traffic goes through the SIG first." If this new way of thinking of enterprise security catches on it might even help speed up the adoption of IPv6, which is held back partly by fears that it could punch holes through network perimeters and because many companies still have old firewalls and equipment that don't have proper support for it. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

When writing Progressive Web Applications, does it make sense to add a JavaScript framework or library? JS frameworks have their pros and cons. by Jonathan Danylko ¬∑ Feb. 14, 17 ¬∑ Mobile Zone Like (0) Comment (0) Save Tweet {{ articles[0].views | formatCount}} Views Edit Delete {{ articles[0].isLocked ?

Join For Free As I mentioned in a previous post, Progressive Web Applications (PWA) are a new way to build responsive mobile websites allowing users to use their browser instead of native apps. When you go this route, you get limited functionality as opposed to the full native experience. However, browsers are adding more native features through JavaScript APIs. They're slowly catching up. Slowly. Until then, we continue to work with the current list of features in JavaScript to enhance the user's experience. But couldn't we just use a library or framework to structure our PWA instead of writing plain JavaScript? Javascript Libraries and Frameworks Do we need a JavaScript framework or library to build a Progressive Web Application? Taken from Google's Progressive Web App page, here are some of the characteristics of a Progressive Web App: Progressive. Works for every user regardless of their browser. Responsive. The app works on any form factor whether it's desktop, mobile, or tablet. Connectivity-independent. Allows the user to use the web app even if it's offline. Native look and feel. Acts and feels like a native application, but is strictly web-based. Fresh. Always up-to-date with a service worker update process. Safe. Always served up to the client through HTTPS. Discoverable. Even though it's an "application," it can be indexed into a search engine. Re-engageable. Allows re-engagement through features like push notifications. Zero-deploy hassle. Allows users to add the web app to their home screen without having issues with app stores. Link-friendly. Allows you to reshare using a URL. After looking over this list two or three times, I didn't see speed anywhere on this list to be considered a factor. I guess it could be covered under the responsive characteristic, but from every Progressive Web App I've seen, a framework or library wasn't used when building a PWA. Does this seem unusual? No Angular, Backbone, Meteor, or React. Heck, not even jQuery. Why not? I've got a theory. One word: Size. Most JavaScript libraries are too large to load and it keeps the user waiting while everything initializes. If you look at the Weather PWA from Google (which is also a project I converted into a Project Template), you'll notice there isn't any framework attached to it. It's just JavaScript. Minimal. Hand-written. JavaScript. One Shell to Rule Them All Another challenge with a PWA is writing the smallest amount of JavaScript possible. Again, if you notice the weather PWA, it only has one screen. Most full-featured native applications have at least two or more screens to be considered helpful and worthy of a download and a place on your smartphone's "desktop." One of the recommendations from Google is to use a shell-based approach where the shell controls what components are loaded when, where, and how. This is where service workers come into play. Your JavaScript triggers certain events to load data and proceed to hide and show certain areas of the application. The service workers provide more control and flexibility when managing your API calls from JavaScript. The hard part is moving from screen to screen. One question always asked is how do you maintain state in your PWA? This is why the shell-based approach is best when writing a PWA and managing state from screen to screen. Why and Why Not? Based on these arguments, here are some valid points as to why you should and should not use a library or framework. Advantages of Using a Framework Existing shell.¬†Some frameworks already provide you with an application shell giving you a more structured application right out of the box. Modular.¬†A majority of frameworks provide modular loading when needed. Small JavaScript routines.¬†While frameworks provide more structured development, small, compact JavaScript routines win in the end making it faster to load the application and cutting down on the user's wait time. State.¬†The shell mentality gives users a way to maintain state across the pages. Disadvantages of Using a Framework Load time.¬†When adding a JavaScript library, this increases the amount of time it takes before the screen appears for the user. Since Google considers the load time as one of its critical factors for ranking websites, I'm having a hard time justifying using a framework or library to build a PWA, but it would make things tremendously easier. As I scrolled through the Getting Started with Progressive Web Apps on Google's site, I did notice a number of developers already created Progressive Web Applications with and without frameworks. Does this mean I'll use a framework? Maybe. Of course, I'll run some tests to confirm if my app is small and fast enough to load for users. If I do use a framework, I will probably use Aurelia with Visual Studio and see if I can perform bundling and shrinking using the Task Runner. Conclusion Today, I gave some valid points whether developers should use a framework or library to build Progressive Web Applications. This post was primarily meant to be more of a discussion than general statements since I only see one disadvantage to using a JavaScript framework with a PWA, but boy, I wouldn't want to take that chance of ignoring that one disadvantage. It could mean the difference between position 2 and position 23 on Google's search results. (Hint: You want to be on page 1 instead of page 3.) If you do decide to use a framework or library, post a comment below to let the community know that you're building a PWA using a framework. We all want to hear about it. On my end, I will keep everybody up-to-date as to what I experience with writing a PWA with Aurelia. Like This Article?

Beers + WSPR = Fun To this day, I‚Äôm a firm believer in the benefits¬†of simple, informative, and spontaneous conversations with my colleagues ‚Äî at least with the ones who can stand me long enough to chat with me. Chewing the fat with other like-minded folks over a beer or two is a bloody good¬†thing. It‚Äôs how¬†ideas are born, knowledge is shared, and relationships are formed. It‚Äôs an important aspect of any business that is sadly all too often overlooked. No, that‚Äôs not us at the gathering. At a recent gathering of Shiners (yes, there were beers involved), I got chatting with fellow Shiner¬†Aaron Brown. We were nonchalantly discussing the client projects that we were currently working on (and bad-mouthing our manager Luke like¬†we always do), when the topic turned to our side projects. Aaron began to tell me about his¬†keen interest in the Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR) network and how he was looking for a good and fast way to analyze all the public data that they had available for download on the website.¬† He had some cool ideas for analyzing the data, but so far had only been able to analyze a small part of the data using a local MySQL instance. I was quick to tell him that we‚Äôd been really impressed by¬†Google BigQuery¬†on our projects at Telstra, and how I thought it might be just the ticket. It would easily be able to handle the amount of data he was looking at ‚Äî and with $300 free credits on Google Cloud Platform, Aaron would easily be able to analyze the WSPR data to his heart‚Äôs content (Google charge $5 per TB queried in BigQuery). We agreed that¬†when we both had some spare time, we‚Äôd give it a shot¬†and try to load it into BigQuery so he could begin analyzing it. The data Aaron¬†wanted to look at was about eight years' worth ‚Äî 500M rows and roughly¬†60GB. That's not a huge amount by any stretch of the imagination, but it's enough to warrant a BigQuery solution, in my opinion. It sounded like a good plan, and more importantly, it sounded like great fun. One hangover ‚Äî eh, I mean¬†day¬†‚Äî¬†later, I was¬†fumbling around on my machine trying to cause some trouble¬†during my lunch break, when I thought about doing the WSPR load for Aaron. It should take only an hour, I thought. I was wrong. It took less than 45 minutes. Entr√©e: Spin Up a Google Compute Engine Instance Duration: About¬†30 seconds. Actually, I didn‚Äôt even need to spin up a GCE instance (VM). The Google Cloud console has a really cool feature called¬†Cloud Shell. It gives you command-line access to your own personal GCE under the hood, directly in the¬†browser. It even comes with the¬†gcloud¬†tools and components out-of-the-box. Awesome. Mains: Eight Lines of Bash Duration: ~30 minutes. The¬†WSPR download page¬†clearly lists all the files available for download. The data goes back to¬†2008-03 historically. So, a simple bash script with a¬†loop, and¬†wget¬†was all I needed to fetch¬†the files. Once the files were downloaded, then a simple call to¬†gsutil¬†to upload them¬†to a bucket (wsprnet) in Google Cloud Storage ‚Äî and that was that. #!/usr/bin/env bash 
START=2008-03 
while [ "$START" != 2017-02 ]; do
 echo $START 
 wget -P /etc/wsprnet/ http://wsprnet.org/archive/wsprspots-${START}.csv.gz 
 START=$(date -j -v +1m -f "%Y-%m" ${START} +%Y-%m) 
done
gsutil -m cp /etc/wsprnet/* gs://wsprnet/ Dessert: load data from GCS into BigQuery Duration: ~10 minutes. Once the bash script had finished, I had all the data sitting nice and pretty in GCS. I had downloaded the compressed (GZ) versions of the files so it would be quicker. I knew from some previous work that I‚Äôd done with¬†BigQuery that it supports loading GZIP files in from GCS. Too easy. All I needed to do next was to load the data and files into a table in BigQuery. So, I flicked over to the web UI for BigQuery and configured the following simple load job: That took just 10 minutes to load 500M rows and about 60GB of data. Nice. The final result of that load job was all the WSPR data now waiting to be analyzed by Aaron! Digestive Duration: one minute. Tools like BigQuery are commoditizing big data. It‚Äôs so easy and quick to get up and running nowadays, no matter the size of the data you want to analyze. Who wants to be mucking around with Hadoop or Hive clusters or on-prem database instances when you can use tools like these? Seriously. Stay tuned for part two of this post, when Aaron will tell us all about how his analysis went using BigQuery. Oh, and by the way, we‚Äôve made the table in BigQuery public, so anyone can access/analyse it. You can find it¬†here.

Join For Free Discover how to protect your applications from known and unknown vulnerabilities. DevOps has been around for some time, long enough to have some commonly accepted terms ‚Äî for example, CAMS, which stands for Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing. The inclusion of security in DevOps is, as a culture shift, still in its infancy. While some people talk about DevSecOps, I‚Äôm not sure we need a whole new acronym, or a story for how to get Dev, Ops and Security all working together. I think the answer is, we just start to do it, and we fumble, adjust, and improve. Luckily, people are starting to talk about it. I see Francois (@F_Raynaud) of DevSecCon, the AppSec USA conference, and many others, too, starting to talk about DevOps and Security together. I‚Äôm partial to this talk from DevOpsDays PDX (transcription can be found at the bottom of this post). It was given by Adrien Thebo and Chris Barker of Puppet, and Ben Hughes of Etsy. You might also enjoy a similar talk given at AppSec USA. This one was given by Adrien, Chris and Bill Weiss, who also works at Puppet. I've worked with all four of the people speaking in these talks, and I feel lucky to know and work with them. What I Learned From and Appreciated in These Talks First of all, I really loved the emphasis on how important it is to talk to each other, be open, and feeling empathy for the other person‚Äôs (and other team's) job challenges. It‚Äôs hard to build and maintain infrastructure and software, and you're not the only one finding it difficult. Few people are trying to make your job harder, and it's important to remember this, especially when things go wrong. I also paid attention to Ben raising the issue of how difficult it really is to shift the culture. Even though we all talk about the importance of getting together and communicating, note that Ben actually says this presentation is the most he'd talked with developers and operators since he started working in security. I‚Äôm of course partial to the idea of doing an internal three-day mini con. A three-day mini con? What the what? Actually, it‚Äôs a cross-functional group comprised of stakeholders from within the organization, and together, they go through multiple sessions of brainstorming. These sessions are lead by the product owner, who provides the roadmap as planned, manages feedback, and keeps conversations on track. The brainstorming provides two critical things for future collaboration: 1) a shared knowledge of future plans, goals, and possible friction points, and 2) a sense of communitas among the participants that enables better asynchronous communication via tickets or email. In short, it forces everyone to talk with each other, and hash out any gotchas early and often, thus breaking down silo walls. Finally, I really appreciate how both these talks emphasize that moving faster means we need tighter communication loops between Dev, Ops, and Security. (Also, pancakes. Pancakes always help.) These tighter communication loops work to everyone‚Äôs benefit. Because really, who wants that 3 AM page? There are a variety of ways to improve communication between the different groups. Sending developers and operations people to security conferences, or vice versa, is a great idea. You could host lunch-and-learns or other gatherings to make sure Dev, Ops, and Security all hear why a feature is important for the company and its users ‚Äî and get a chance to ask questions, too. Encourage finding ways to the compromise and the yes, rather than getting to the point where Security wants to unplug everything, throw it in a ditch, and pour concrete over it. That‚Äôs a symptom of a problem, not a solution. Whatever means you decide on to encourage communication, empathy, and sharing, the important thing is to break down the silos, so we aren‚Äôt tossing Jira tickets or angry emails at each other. Remember this: We are all humans. Change is hard, it‚Äôs scary and it can‚Äôt happen overnight. Regardless, it is well past time for us to start making these culture changes. Once Dev, Sec, and Ops are all communicating regularly and amicably, we can all succeed together. If we don't make these culture changes, we will all fail together. Beth Cornils is a senior product manager at Puppet. Transcription Devopsdays Portland 2016: Adrien Thebo, Ben Hughes, Chris Barker - Everything Is Terrible Alice Goldfuss: Today's speakers, for this first panel, were the unfortunate consequence of failed cloning. One of them came out British, which was especially disappointing. Male voice: Ooh, shots fired. Alice Goldfuss: It's okay. They're not part of Europe anymore. As they were being sent to the furnace to be disposed of as medical waste, they managed to escape by making a significant Rube Goldberg machine out of Cat 5 cables and ever since then they've been wandering from city to city performing mediocre rock shows and bank heists. And while we do have the cops standing outside, we'd first like to welcome to the stage, they are, Chris Barker, Adrien Thebo, and Ben Hughes. Chris Barker: So this is our talk, titled "Everything is Terrible: Three Perspectives on Building, Configuring, and Securing Software (An Inspirational and Aspirational Talk)." First, some introductions. I'm Chris Barker, otherwise known as @mrzarquan. I tend to give people a lot of suggestions. Sometimes they follow them. I've been doing operations for a while, then about four years ago I decided to go to Puppet. Adrien Thebo: I'm Adrien Thebo. I started in Puppet like five or something years ago. At some point I decided that I wanted to cause people mild retina damage when they look at me, so there's that. Currently a developer and very angry about security. Ben Hughes: What have I done? I'm Ben Hughes. I used to work at Puppet and I'm not convinced I don't still. I'm now at Etsy, which is relatively obvious, and I work in security so I consume a lot of gin. Chris Barker: We wanted to talk about how the world was before DevOps came about for all three of our roles, being in operations, development, and security. On the operations side, I'm sitting there kind of waiting for somebody to hand me a tarball maybe, or just a bunch of files to deploy on a server while I'm in the middle of doing all my other work, of trying to actually spin all the plates, keep things from working, or not working in some cases. Adrien Thebo:¬†So I'd be in the role of the developer, given any number of requirements, some of which may be physically impossible, varying deadlines, scope change. I want to ship the software as quickly as I can. Get my builds out, and hopefully it will pass QA and then throw it over the wall. Maybe it'll be in Google Drive. That's a good deployment mechanism, right? Ben Hughes: In a Google document. A tarball in a Google document. Adrien Thebo: Challenge accepted. Chris Barker:¬†After I'd get that I'd get it up and running hopefully along with trying to get all the other things working as well, then maybe a couple weeks later I'd tell Ben, or he would find out. Ben Hughes: Then I'd ‚Äî what's the polite way of phrasing this? ‚Äî panic slightly? Lose my decorum and go, "Why is this on the public internet? Why are there all these ports open? What idiot wrote this code? I'm just going to turn this off because I like saying no to people, and I'm quite mean." Chris Barker:¬†So, after this it goes back to maybe a three-month cycle from the time that Adrien actually built the software to somebody actually says we can put customers in front of it. What this really leads to is one continuous tire fire. But now, Adrien and I have gone to DevOpsDays. We maybe use some configuration management tools. We're in this really awesome agile DevOps world, right? Adrien Thebo:¬†Yeah, we're sitting around the campfire singing "Kumbaya." We are having very quick iterations. I'm deploying four times a day. I'm shipping all sorts of random new code all the time. I'm delighted because I can put something into production right away. It's great. Chris Barker: From my standpoint, I'm able to build servers really quickly. I've probably moved a lot of my workflow over to AWS for dev and test. I'm able to deploy these things called security groups, which are kind of like firewall rules. I don't really know how they work, but they kind of have set up the way that I want. They're firewall rules written in JSON. That's all that they are. Chris Barker: That makes so much more sense now. We're still very happy but for some reason there's still some kind of friction going on. Ben Hughes: What I see is, my orange-haired friend is able to pick any library he finds on GitHub or SourceForge and just throw that in the code today, or even like over lunch. Whereas before I had three months to try and find all the bugs, now I have three minutes. There's even more random libraries going up. There's even more random servers going up. No one can configure files in JSON. Of course the natural language of files is XML, because that wouldn't go wrong. We've moved from a world where I had three months to panic and ‚Äî Am I allowed to swear? Is that allowed? Organizer, can I swear? Alice Goldfuss: I thought I was the insult. Do not do gendered slurs. Ben Hughes: All right. I lose my shit ‚Äî thank you, Organizer ‚Äî because there's now way more stuff on fire than before. Whereas there was only slow-burning things, there's now the slow-burning things from before, and the tiny, miniature, artisanal tire fires in AWS. Chris Barker:¬†So what really becomes the problem here is that there's actually this whole different misalignment, right? Even on the DevOps side, we're still trying to get to this point of people collaborating together and working on things. But what does that really mean when an organization maybe hasn't embraced this change throughout the whole structure? Adrien Thebo:¬†From a development perspective, my responsibility is to take product specifications and ship them. I'm trying to figure out ways where I can ship new code. Ship things rapidly. Take the things that I was given and make them reality. I want to be able to build new functionality without necessarily having to reinvent the wheel. If I have to do image processing, it would be convenient for me to use ImageMagick, or something like that. Because I don't want to ‚Äî Ben Hughes: Please do. Adrien Thebo:¬†And this is how I'd do the bank heists. Building new software and minimizing the reinvention of wheels and trying to work quickly, effectively, and this creates a whole lot of fire. Ben Hughes: I'm also not convinced no developer want to reinvent the wheel, because every developer thinks they can invent a better wheel. Adrien Thebo:¬†I don't think, I know. Ben Hughes: I love you developers, really. Chris Barker: As someone who is working in operations ‚Äî [Adrien and Ben hug] Ben Hughes: That's the magic of DevOps right there. Chris Barker:¬†That's for the end of the talk. Adrien Thebo: More hugs are better. Chris Barker:¬†So from the operations standpoint, my priorities are really trying to keep the plates that I have spinning, the backlog of work minimized. I'm sitting there working on trying to triage all of the existing projects. Some of the work that a development team may have done has gone off to another project. Now I'm the one who is actually in charge of the care and feeding of a project. Probably a bunch of Red Hat servers sitting around as well. Some of those are enterprise Linux Red Hat, other ones are just Red Hat, and maybe NT4. Ben Hughes: Still newer than CentOS. Chris Barker:¬†Yes. And so really from my standpoint, I like for things to stop burning. I'll take stability over any new features that can come into the environment. And I'm really trying to keep my 3 a.m. pages down. Honestly, in areas, I'm making decisions that are based on how to minimize getting woken up at four in the morning. I'm also doing things that are causing Ben's problems. I turn off firewalls because, dammit, I need to just make this thing work and nobody told me what ports the service is actually communicating on. So I'm just going to open up everything until things start working and the app starts running again so I can close the ticket. I'd like to be able to work on my backlog but it's getting longer and longer and longer. Most of the time that means I just can kind of stand around and watch stuff. But it's in a perimeter, right? Myself and my colleagues, if I'm lucky, are able to sit there and kind of keep things cordoned off. Ben Hughes: Security has, of course, a different set of wants, which are the most important, because if there's one thing security has, it's egos galore. You can advance because I don't have the clicker. We want things not to change so that we can try and get a decent grasp of what's out there and find as many bugs as possible. Things really not changing ever, because that just brings in unknowns and bad things you want. Except when there's patches which must happen this instant, and you must drop everything you're doing because there's nothing more important than me and my work. Which is why, I don't know what Ops are doing all the time, but they should be patching my stuff. It's ridiculous. You are ridiculous. Go rob a bank. Chris Barker:¬†That's great. I'm the one who didn't get to dye his hair. Adrien Thebo: That's after. Ben Hughes: I thought you were blonde? Chris Barker: No. So how do we kind of start resolving these things? Some of it is really just getting us to work together. The fact that there's three of us up here right now talking about the problems that we have, in part with each other but also with our jobs and our priorities, helps us try to get in alignment so we actually know what's going on. Also so we can understand and empathize with each other on here. The next thing that you can start doing around this is integrating some training, some things across the teams around this. But really, you also have to do things such as address some of the structural issues that you might have at an organization. So ensuring there's interaction points so that devs can actually talk to security people, and that operations and security people talk to each other more than just over angry emails and ticket wars. Ben Hughes: What can't JIRA fix? Chris Barker: Nothing. Actually wait, no. JIRA did give me an email alias really quickly yesterday. That was a human, but it went through JIRA. Ben Hughes: I'm pleased. And I still maintain that for a lot of my career, this conversation is more than I've had with dev teams and operations teams while being in security. That would have been useful 15 years ago. Well done us for sitting on this for 15 years. Traditionally operations people like sitting in their cave. Developers like, I don't know, sitting in their Jacuzzi writing mad code. Security people, let's not talk about them, but the generally don't play well with others. I think that needs to change in the way that certainly DevOps has tried to bring operations closer to devs. I don't know if it's brought devs closer to ops. Adrien Thebo:¬†In a lot of cases you have the security team coming in after the fact, after the code is live, after things are already burning, but these are issues of, "Hey, maybe I need to do some image processing. I need a library." Instead of waiting for the, "Oh, this library is horribly vulnerable, and we've never seen so many rootkits on one server," we talk to security up front and say, "Hey, we would like to do X, Y, or Z. What's your advice on this? What libraries are safe? What things should we know up front?" Because this guy has a wealth of knowledge. The security teams that have so much information. Ah, maybe we're just screwed. No, they do have a wealth of knowledge and experience and this is something that, if you tap into earlier, you can do things right from the beginning just by talking to people. It's easy to forget, but it turns out that the simple things ‚Äî Ben Hughes: Turn... into magic. Chris Barker:¬†So we keep talking about structure, and some of this is also going to the cultural points too. Such as, always assume that people aren't trying to screw you over, unless they're Ben. But really, truly actually trying to build a space, kind of security as a safe space. People can come to you and say, "Hey I clicked on this email, there's a problem with that." Or, "Hey, I want to build this thing out." Or, "Help me figure out how to write better JSON firewall rules so that it doesn't actually suck." Ben Hughes: I blame Amazon for everything. Chris Barker:¬†Part of this is also why we have this idea of doing rotations, right? If you can work together and collaborate together, then people actually have a better understanding of how things are going. Adrien Thebo: For developers, once again, consulting security for best practices, but just going out, getting training. Attending DEFCON for instance, or going to an all-ops training or anything like that. There's a lot of things that you may not think about, like timing attacks. Which, it's like, "Oh, I'll just do a for loop. Oh, I can optimize this, make this faster." That's bad. So learning what you actually need to address instead of trying to bolt on security afterwards. I think we're talking about tooling later. Ben Hughes: Also go to BSides Portland, because they're our media sponsor, and they're lovely people. Chris Barker:¬†So some more specifics around this that we actually would really want to call out is the idea of coordinated planning. At Puppet, one of the things that we've started doing is whenever we build a new product or feature ‚Äî actually Beth here is the one who introduced the idea of holding ‚Äî so we can single her out, she's the person who's laughing loudly usually when we're making fun of each other ‚Äî is the idea of a mini convention. We actually have a three-day internal con that has subject matter experts across the field, including folks in operations, people who are handling some of the security aspects, and the development team, so that everyone actually has a baseline at the start of the project of what, one, who the people involved are. But also as the project goes on, there's more interaction with that. So all of a sudden if I'm getting a ticket from Adrien about something, I actually remember back two or three months ago, the actual conversation we had. It's this empathy. We had time to sit down and work with it so I know what the hell he needs these library services for in the first place. Or I know what database is in place. Security knows ahead of time that yes, we're going to be doing testing in AWS, but we're going to be using maybe this pre-built or verified firewall process ahead of time. Or just tell them that it's actually going to be running in AWS in this availability zone, so that's not somebody leaking their GitHub keys. Adrien Thebo:¬†It's hard to understate the importance of empathy. It's very easy for me to think, here's my responsibilities, I don't have to go any farther. The server is not my problem. Security, I don't care. It is this lack of empathy that, it's like there's a ticket at 3 a.m. Things are on fire and it's like, finger pointing begins and there's blame being thrown around and the issue isn't being addressed. We're just creating hostile relationships and it becomes harder to work together. But with this mini-con idea, you sit down in the room and you have this shared goal. You are trying to achieve this thing. You can see that everyone there is in good faith. You actually are working on the same project together. I know we're all paranoid of like, oh we can't have touchy-feely talks. But the basic human interactions do really matter. The difference between the, oh God, we had another vulnerability, and the, oh, we, as a team, may have made a mistake. Let's fix this together. This can mean the difference between hating your coworkers and having hugs onstage and such. Chris Barker: I don't know if you want to add anything about hate. Ben Hughes: I have a record collection about hate. Yeah, security has traditionally been a very unfriendly, unwelcoming place. I hope that's slowly changing. Certainly as the industry matures. But it's very much been a, we say no, we block things, we turn things off. Which, even ignoring how much you hug someone, is not always the best way to do business. And security does lose sight of, these things are put in place to enable business, not ‚Äî Most companies' job isn't to be the most secure company, it's to actually try and make money. Because yay capitalism. Just turning everything off and covering all your servers in concrete and burying them would be secure, but you would also be quite unemployed quite rapidly, unless you also had a sideline in making concrete. And who doesn't have one of those. Chris Barker:¬†I guess I need one. Also on this, we've mentioned rotations a lot. There's a presenter, you might have heard of her, her name is Alice Goldfuss. She does an awesome talk called, "Rock Stars, Builders, and Janitors." If you can, catch it. Is it online? Is the video up? Alice Goldfuss: Yeah, it's on YouTube. Chris Barker: Sweet. Really watch that as one of the ways to look at ‚Äî If you need a quick intro to how you can possibly start doing rotations, for people to start interacting with each other. Going really from the standpoint of, what are the things people don't want to do first so that you can actually understand why the work that no one wants to do is the work that everyone should first figure out how to do. So you build empathy and realize, "Wow, I don't want to make more mistakes for other people to have to clean up." Ben Hughes: Someone else will do that via libraries or kernel exploits. You'll have to clean those up anyway, so try and add fewer of those. Chris Barker:¬†Yeah. The other thing on here is what comes up a lot too when we start talking about security, is people start talking about things like doing bug bounties, doing pen testing. If you're at the point where you're still trying to figure out how to have the conversation with a security person, you probably don't want to spend all the money on a bug bounty yet because you're going to fix that first. If I can actually work with Ben, we'll get rid of all of the low hanging fruit so we don't have to pay out a full salary to a bug bounty team, when we realize just working with Ben can find all those ahead of time. Ben Hughes: When Etsy first launched their bug bounty program back in, I don't know, four years ago, the first two weeks were just spent triaging bugs and getting mostly the security team working with developers to get them all fixed. That was everyone on the security team just doing bug bounty stuff. We'd already had a security team for a number of years and had already had some audits at that point anyway. There are bugs out there so don't rush into bug bounties. Chris Barker:¬†As everyone talks about how DevOpsDays isn't about tooling, but then we have the slide where we talk about how let's talk about some of the tooling that you might want to look at. Adrien Thebo: One of the things that I've been working with a few other people is embedding security testing right as part of the CI pipeline. So if you make a mistake, if you write code that doesn't do proper SSL verification, or doesn't respect CRLs, your tests pass, your code doesn't get merged. This is really nice. It means that ‚Äî Isn't that slide hypnotizing? It's been really rough when we've been preparing for this. Ben Hughes: Just really hungry now. Adrien Thebo:¬†Pancakes. Ben Hughes: They're gluten-free. Adrien Thebo:¬†Nothing is ever too soon for you Ben. So yeah, doing this very aggressive like, if your code is not secure, if it has issues, it does not get merged into the build. It means that you can work with at least a little bit more confidence. An example of this is no go to fail, where it does some really rigorous SSL verification. Or tools, I'm not sure if Gauntlet's been mentioned much. Gauntlet is a kind of Cucumber syntax sort of driven, penetration testing tool. It will hook into Nmap and maybe Metasploit and such like that. So you can say, okay, we have a live build on this server, let's bring it down, or let's do everything we can. You can hook this up to monitoring, where you have security tests that call Nagios alerts. When you ship code to your staging server, you get an alert saying, "Hey, if this code would go live then you would have new and exciting services running on your server." Having that continuous checking is quite powerful. Chris Barker:¬†Also on that area is obviously infrastructure-as-code tools. I'm a little biased. Puppet is pretty good at this. But there's other ones here too. Chef is also here. At least it's a configuration management tool and not someone's shell script, which is what I used to have to spend most of my time fixing. The reason for this is, how I see it is, my infrastructure-as-code, my actual code, my repo that I'm using to build servers, is something that I can work with the security team on. One, so security can validate my server configurations and I can repeatedly deploy them, but also becomes a contract I can provide to my development team. So they can say, "Look, this is what you're going to get." I can pin specific libraries in place so that OpenSSL is pinned at a specific version. We know that this is it. Or in some cases we can just ensure latest so that it always has the latest version on it, and then reboot everything. The idea is I can have an easy, programmatic way to instantiate my systems, which makes Ben's life a lot easier because he can inspect that code, possibly raise issues on it, rarely send a pull request, but at least know there's a baseline in which I'm building my systems now. Ben Hughes: What we've actually done for some of our stuff is when we've found ‚Äî when there's been vulnerability announcements and CentOS eventually make a patch ‚Äî or, sorry, recompile a patch from Red Hat ‚Äî is putting that information in Chef into a fact. No not a fact, I've got that wrong, haven't I? What does Chef use? Ohai thing? I don't know. My infrastructure brain is gone. And then we have Nagios. I did remember that. Alerting on that so that if any hosts are suddenly vulnerable to this, then someone will get notified. Probably not paged, but emailed. Then as soon as new servers are integrated, or spun up, or whatever you do with servers, it will get these Nagios checks probably. Then we can always have, is everything patched to at least this level, and that's all done for us automatically. Chris Barker:¬†That's a similar thing we do on the operations side in other tools. Also with the monitoring aspect,s you can do some very creative things with your config management. Some of the things you can have set up are being able to deploy ‚Äî That really is still going. I should have had that pause. If you're using tools like Sensu you can actually broadcast events to the Sensu system before or after your config management tool is running. Just being able to alert to Sensu that, hey I'm going to run Puppet right now, so if a service restarts in this window when Puppet is running, you probably don't need to raise an error. But also, if Puppet has just finished running and a service stopped, that is a good way of indicating somebody just ate that service and you probably need to alert whoever just triggered the Puppet run, and if you can tie that back to a code change or other system. Lastly, in terms of tools, this is much of equipping yourself and your team on this. At Puppet we do a DevOps survey. The folks out there can give you a copy of it. It includes a section talking about security and how security, as part of your DevOps process, is a useful way ‚Äî it's research on this. If you need to go back to the organization and get buy in to help with the structural changes, these cultural changes, there are numbers and graphs and data to help prove the point instead of just saying, "Hey, I just say these three weirdos standing on a stage for 30 minutes talking about this stuff." There's actually some science to back this up. Specifically, organizations that have these sorts of policies literally spend half the time they otherwise would on security events and remediation, is the biggest finding we found out of it from the survey this last year. Ben Hughes: If the media of the last year hasn't convinced you that maybe a security is a good thing, then I hope the survey will, because it's been a pretty rough year for security. Adrien Thebo:¬†There's the aspect too that having a very secure server does not inherently make you money. Having a vulnerable server will cause you to lose money, maybe, at some point. Being able to say, here are the numbers, here's your risk factor, here's all the time you're losing, and this is how you can once again save money and be more efficient. You're putting a monetary cost onto something that was otherwise an unquantifiable good thing. We always knew it was a good thing, we just may not have been able to justify it. Saying, "Hey, you want to save a whole lot of money here, or do you want to save face in front of the entire world and be more efficient? Hey, maybe should do these smart things." Ben Hughes: Proving security is starting to save you money due to the horrible world of cyber-insurance, where if you have more security you will pay less on your cyber-insurance premiums. What a horrible word that is. But it's sadly now a very real thing. Chris Barker:¬†Otherwise known as a gin budget. Ben Hughes: It's generally where a ridiculous number of insurance companies say you should allocate this much money to spend on Mandiant when you're broken into. And then you argue with them about why that's a ridiculous number. And then you hire more security people. Chris Barker:¬†Just to wrap this up ‚Äî Ben's going to talk about more of the cultural changes later, at his next talk. We managed to wrangle him in for this one as well. So you get twice as much twitchy Ben today. Ben Hughes: My chronic insomnia is really bad at the moment, so I've not really slept. Adrien Thebo:¬†I've got a really good view of his bloodshot eyes from here. But it is worth emphasizing, we've already done this with Dev and Ops. We've broken down that silo. But we're not done yet. We're very far from being done. Once again, start these conversations. Be engaged with these people. Remember that we are all on this common goal together. You can achieve a lot just by having those mini cons, bringing people into the fold sooner, making this a priority. It saves you money and you meet new people and all that great stuff. Male questioner:¬†It's probably included in the conversation you had earlier about dev and security needing to be closer together, but one of the things that development tends to be unaware of is blast radius. If something goes wrong with this component, what does it mean all the way down the line? This goes into major vendors. I just finished teaching a class with a major vendor that left open a container port, and suddenly I got a nastygram from a large cloud provider saying, "Why are you DDOS-ing my people?" Is there a formal system right now for evaluating the effects of bugs in particular areas that you can communicate back, and say this is why security needs to be part of this reference architecture? Ben Hughes: I'm sure a vendor will try and sell you something to do that. I think it's, as systems get more complicated, it gets harder because it used to be you compromise one system, you have that system and its network link and as much disk as it has. Now, you compromise a machine, then you find the AWS creds. Now you have as much AWS as you can use until the accounting department starts crying. Not that that would ever happen. So I think it's a really hard thing to quantify. I think sadly some of the best people who will quantify are people trying to sell you insurance, because they have a very strong monetary interest in working out what that exposure is. I think that still very immature because it's so new and it's not really that explored. Yeah, good luck. Chris Barker:¬†Some of this might be able to be derived from maybe staging and QA areas. To actually get an idea of what's the scope of this? If you're building and developing a service that's going to only have five systems, but you're going to throw it behind an auto-scale group that's going to go up to 250, it's really starting to keep those things in mind. That's something I found. It can sometimes be a perspective that I've always had from working in the operations standpoint because my view has always been, I'm going to be responsible for N number of systems. That becomes more complicated as things go on. Versus just having that development environment that you're focused in on. Just try to get this work on three and then we'll scale it later. I think getting an idea of what is actually building the applications and what's in there. Having at least communication going on so that doing a formal assessment may be difficult, but it definitely is something that would be easier to surface once you're having these conversations. Ben Hughes: If you have the money and it's on a particular thing, then just contract someone to do a red team engagement on it and they will tell you how big the blast radius is and then everything else they've broken into, and all of your PII that you didn't know was in another system, and go from there. That doesn't scale, but if the specifics ‚Äî It's terrifying and exciting. Male questioner:¬†Good morning. I was just curious, in a DevOps world, or model, if any of the responsibilities of security change. The security team is still accountable for overall security, but do any of the responsibilities move to some of the Ops or Developers? Adrien Thebo:¬†They don't change because they always should have been, everyone is responsible for security. I would say that security is, they are there to help. They are there to advise. They are there to say, "Hey that's a really dumb thing you're doing. Let's not put that into production." And at the end of the day, security is there to say, "Hey, we have found these holes. Let's resolve these problems." Developers have to be security conscious, 100 percent. We were all just at DEFCON, and oh man, the vulnerabilities we saw were fascinating because of programming flaws. You can't put a timing vulnerability behind a firewall. You can't hide a lot of things. Developers have to be security conscious. Operations, that's where the rubber hits the road. Unless security starts standing up servers, which might be cool, these guys are responsible for where everything is run. This is effectively the first line of defense. The responsibility was always there, so the answer you want is yes, but we always should have been saying, "security is everybody's responsibility." Did I get it all? Ben Hughes: I mean you got most things ever said. Adrien Thebo:¬†I talk quickly. Ben Hughes: The things that change for operations and devs in this wonderful DevOps thing also change, in some ways, for security in that you're now not a wall to be thrown over, you actually have to have conversations rather than just mandate things. Which leads to, I don't want to say leads to compromise because there are too many double meanings on that. But that leads to a shared understanding. There we go. Thank you, thesaurus. Rather than just, it's this, you must do this. You have to communicate more, which security people are not good at, as I'm proving by rambling over the same point. Male questioner:¬†I'd love to hear your thoughts about, say you have a web app that used that used HTTP Proxy, and there was a big fire drill when everybody had to go turn that off and sanitize. What if that breaks your application in the process? I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Adrien Thebo: I think I heard someone in the front row say, "That sucks." If you're saying this specifically with respect to a security fire drill ‚Äî What was a vulnerable thing that happened, like some bad software being shipped? Ben Hughes: That's cool. You learned something. You found a new thing that you can make better. Depending on your website, taking it down may or may not be a big deal. You don't work at Delta, do you? I ask for no reason. I just need some cheap flights and some bitcoin. I don't know. Gamedays and security are definitely a thing. It's a thing we've been pushing in our organization. What happens if we break this in this way? But as an attacker, not as an ops person doing whatever gamedaying Ops people do. Sipping whiskey. Chris Barker:¬†Tripping over the network cable. Ben Hughes: Yeah. I don't know. At Etsy we like learning, so we turn it into a learning exercise and then hug for an hour. It sounds like a painful thing but a thing you now know more about. Chris Barker:¬†In the area of having a reactive to that is usually a triage team or something would come together. That would kind of compromise the representatives of all three areas of interest to work on that to find the resolution going forward. In some cases that's something that may happen as a symptom of not having that communication happening. It's really hard to be like, "Hey, we found this problem, now let's immediately implement all of the DevOps and security integration to fix it." You can kind of do that where folks talk about, let's do a firefighting drill on that, but then you realize that you're really good at fighting fires and you wait until they happen. In some ways you can use it to pilot internally. Let's not dissolve the team once we've actually fixed that. Let's have them keep going forward and keep iterating on that as they keep working.

So I asked Google for a comment and got a no comment from them on the update. I am not surprised but I wanted to report back to you all that Google is not confirming or denying that there was an update last week. They are simply not commenting. John Mueller from Google isn't really commenting either but he did reply to two tweets about it this morning. He basically said Google is always changing. Here are those tweets: @TodaysSEO @googlewmc is that a good thing or a bad thing? I guess it always depends on which site you look at :). We always make changes.‚Äî John ‚òÜ.o(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)o.‚òÜ (@JohnMu) February 14, 2017 @kdsharmas we make so many changes that there's bound to be 1+ on that day too.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google Search Console Updates Crawl Status/Errors Report For Apps Google Search Console Updates Crawl Status/Errors Report For Apps Feb 14, 2017 ‚Ä¢ 7:59 am | (3) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It ¬† Prev Story Next Story Google has made a data update to the Google Search Console report specifically for mobile apps. The crawl status and crawl errors report was updated on January 23, 2017 to reflect a more accurate "number of app pages with URIs" Google is able to find within your mobile apps via Firebase Google App Indexing. The data anomalies page says: Search Console has improved the accuracy of reporting the number of app pages with URIs. This is not a change in the number of actual pages indexed, but rather an accounting change that will show a more accurate number of indexed app pages. This has zero to do with ranking changes or anything around Google's search results and all about how the report may have changed. Since we have deployed mobile apps for this site, I can share our graphs with you: My concern is that nothing has changed within the app but now I have a bunch of errors. Before this update, I had about 5,600 URLs indexed and now after I have over 7,000 indexed but about 550 errors as well, as opposed to zero error. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Well, it seems that update was fairly significant and more and more webmasters and SEOs are taking notice. The ongoing WebmasterWorld thread is heavy into it and there are new threads popping up at the Black Hat World forums as well. Many have shared screen shots of their traffic or visibility drops with Google organic search as well. Here are two from Glenn Gabe: Well isn't that interesting? :) Big surge for that site based on the 2/7 update. With many others in that niche seeing big movement too. pic.twitter.com/VE3UsAZRGs‚Äî Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) February 11, 2017 @basgr Here's another screenshot. Big surge... in a niche I know very well. :) pic.twitter.com/bqW0PZveuG‚Äî Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) February 11, 2017 He told me has many others to share and will be working up a detailed blog post of his own on his blog in the upcoming days. Here are some more recent remarks in the forums: I've been monitoring my main keywords since Monday. I see a completely non-standard float. Right now my main keyword went down to the eighth page, a few hours later it returned to normal. Seen massive changes in serps again over the past few days. Something has definitely rolled out. We've had a noticeable increase in Google traffic in the last few days. It started on Monday, and the increases for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday over the previous week have ranged from about 10 to 13 percent. 30K a month has gone to 15K a month. Thats how hard I have been hit with this update. Spent last 2 years improving the entire site and spent well over $30,000 on site. Have no popups no adverts just some amazon links... fresh content added 3 times a week every week for past 4 years. Feb the 7th I got hammered, Why ? i dont know ..maybe my site does not have enough adverts ? not enough popups ? ...The problem with this model of business is you can spend a lot of time on something and it ends up all turning to nothing. Its a horrible place to be..lucky i have a second job.. I feel for others without that luxury... Just imagine doing your house up for a year or two, spending loads of money on it.. then finding out your house is now worth 30% less than when you started.. This is how bad things are with this business model DEPRESSING A lot of terms that I track for my site and a few tests seems to be dancing a lot, specially sites on 2nd and 1st page. Anyone else? I can keep going on. In fact, there are almost 200 comments in my original story about these changes. Have you seen changes? Some are loving them and some are hating them - which is typical of any Google update. Google has not confirmed or denied any update but I will ask them again.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google Fast Track Indexing Vs. Normal Indexing Google Fast Track Indexing Vs. Normal Indexing Feb 13, 2017 ‚Ä¢ 7:59 am | (10) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It ¬† Prev Story Next Story Google's John Mueller in a video hangout last Friday at the 1:04 mark into the video addressed the common question of why does a page or URL show up in Google's index for a couple days or so and then drop out, especially new URLs that were not indexed yet by Google. John Mueller explains that there are essentially two ways to get indexed, one is the normal indexing method where when pages get indexed they are more likely to stay in the index for longer periods of time. The second he called "fast track" indexing where Google quickly puts it into the index, maybe because you used the submit to index feature in the fetch as Google in Google Search Console. Those pages may not stay in the index for long periods of time, not at least until the normal indexing method picks up the page. Fast track indexing can lead to pages getting indexed faster but may not result in the page staying in the index. Normal indexing will likely result in the page being found in the Google index for longer periods of time. This is a common behavior seen for years and years, where new sites and pages would be indexed quickly and then drop out and come back into the index at a later date. Here is the video embed at the start time: Here is the transcript: Question: We have some pages that we use the fetch as Google tool, to just make sure they were okay, to make sure they were indexed because some were not in the index yet. They are in our sitemap. And out of, last week, we did about 17 of them, 9 of them have been indexed and stayed in the index and about 8 of them are in the index or were in the index and about a week later, they have fallen out of the index. Is that normal? Can that happen? Is there an explanation for that? Answer: That can definitely happen. So the submit to index tool is essentially a way to fast track the speed for indexing but it doesn‚Äôt mean that they will remain like that. So what can happen on the one hand is that they switch into like the primary indexing mode where we index it normally, that can happen kind of immediately afterwards or overlapping where you wouldn‚Äôt see anything drop. Sometimes what happens is the more normal indexing in the later steps where a URL will be indexed first with kind of fast track indexing and drop out for a couple days and then be indexed normally. So that is something that can definitely happen. It usually is not a sign that there is anything wrong with those pages. It really is that we haven‚Äôt gotten to them with the normal indexing and therefor maybe it will take a little bit longer to kind of move over to that second part. Forum discussion at YouTube Live.

How do the recent updates to Google Data Studio benefit marketers? Analytics SEO 13 Feb 17 | Clark Boyd Facebook0 Linkedin115 Google+13 Twitter 128 In a slew of recent posts on their Analytics blog, Google has announced the removal of the 5 report limit in Data Studio in the US, integration with Search Console, and most recently, enhanced support for AdWords MCC accounts. So what is Data Studio, why has Google focused so much attention on improving it, and what benefits does it provide for marketers? Data Studio: A brief recap Data Studio was launched in beta as part of Google‚Äôs Analytics 360 suite in May 2016. The aim of the platform was (and remains) clear: to provide Analytics users with an intuitive, shareable dashboard solution that allows them to make sense of their data. Its functionality reflects this purpose. Users can drag and drop a range of graphs and charts onto a blank canvas, then populate them using the dimensions, metrics and goals from their GA account. As such, anyone familiar with Google Analytics should be able to create polished, professional dashboards to help inform their business decisions. Data Studio delivers on that promise, but the restrictive 5 dashboard limit and a lack of platform integrations curbed its widespread uptake last year beyond the expensive 360 Suite. However, these recent announcements go some way to creating a solution with universal appeal. Data Studio integrations Following the announcement of Search Console integration and enhanced MCC support, the list of connectors (connections to a specific type or source of data) now looks as follows: Marketers who have adopted the full suite of Google products will find a wide variety of new opportunities for data analysis and reporting here. The addition of Search Console support brings SEO into the fold too, adding the capability to show keyword-level performance through impression, clicks and CTR data. Furthermore, the MCC updates provide two new benefits: Users can now select up to 75 sub-accounts to include within their dashboard, rather than having to connect the whole account Currency fields are removed if they differ across sub-accounts, removing some of the difficulties seen when Google aggregates multiple currencies into one report. The addition of Search Console support to Google Data Studio¬†adds the capability to show keyword-level performance through impression, clicks and CTR data Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin115 Google+13 Twitter 128 Related articles The psychology of search intent: Converting moments that matter How can you successfully set up an efficient business blog on a very tight budget? Five most interesting search news stories of the week What's been going on with Google's mobile indexing? But what about non-Google products? Do they integrate with Data Studio? Yes, albeit in a slightly¬†roundabout fashion. Eagle-eyed readers may have noticed Google Sheets among the list of available connectors. So if data from Facebook, for example, is scheduled to export automatically to Sheets, this information will then be included within your Data Studio dashboard quite seamlessly. Although not as direct an integration as other enterprise-level reporting suites can provide, this is still a hugely beneficial capability. Moreover, the customizable, intuitive nature of Data Studio should make up for this inefficiency among a large user base. Does this mean the democratization of data analysis? At a basic level, it might do ‚Äì and this is a platform designed to engage novices, after all.¬† But if the improvements keep coming at the recent pace, we could be looking at a very powerful contender for more advanced data analysts too. These highly customizable reports also allow users to circumvent many of the inefficiencies that arise from searching in GA to collect data, synthesize it and then produce compelling visualizations. This is clearly good news for marketers and business owners alike, removing some of the barriers to entry for useful, everyday data analysis.

Computers by Stephen Shankland February 14, 2017 5:00 AM PST @stshank Enlarge Image Apple's Touch Bar-equipped 15-inch MacBook Pro debuted in 2016. Stephen Shankland/CNET It took six weeks of tech support calls, power usage monitoring and Genius Bar diagnostics, but I'm finally convinced my new MacBook Pro isn't an expensive mistake. And what I've learned along the way can help you, too -- regardless of what laptop you're using. I bought a 15-inch Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro sight unseen late last year, confident that performance improvements, Apple's superior trackpads and better portability would justify the upgrade from its 2012-era predecessor. But my pleasure at the speed-up evaporated when I noticed within the first week how fast the machine drained its battery. My heart sank when the revamped Mac design lasted only 3 hours, 7 minutes on battery in my first formal test just doing routine work -- chores in Google's Chrome browser, chiefly, but also a few minutes on power-hungry photo editing. This was not supposed to be what happened when one of the biggest reasons I upgraded was to replace the feeble, worn-out battery in the old machine. I feared my Apple was a lemon. It wasn't just me, though, as evidenced by forum fretting and some cases of customer returns. But with help from Apple techies and a lot of testing, I reached a different conclusion: The MacBook's terrific new screen, which maxes out at a significantly brighter level, was gobbling watts despite a more energy-efficient design. There are other factors, but dialing down the brightness helped me once again work all day on a single charge. For full details, check CNET's tips on how to get your MacBook Pro battery to last all day. Overall, I'm satisfied. Still, the experience made it clear that even top tech companies like Apple, Google and Adobe Systems still have lots of work to do delivering products that minimize power consumption. And it's disappointing how often power-saving techniques mean micromanaging your machine or doing without useful features. A decade after the iPhone launch, it's time to assume your customers will be unplugged from the power socket more often than not. Hopes dashed Apple boasts of battery life "up to 10 hours" on two tests -- "wireless web" and "iTunes movie playback." When my Mac fell far short, I started investigating. Apple's Activity Monitor utility initially showed disappointing battery-life scores. Screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET I was not encouraged by posts like the explanation from developer Jeff Geerling on why he returned his MacBook Pro or the dozens of pages of commentary on Apple's support site. I spoke to others, too. Duarte Cunha Rosa, a lawyer in Portugal, was distressed when his new 13-inch MacBook Pro wouldn't last more than 5 hours, and Apple tech support couldn't help. "When asked if I wanted to return it, I did," he said, pulling his 6-year-old Mac back into service. "I'm seriously blanking on what my next move is." I ran daily tests for weeks to try to understand what was happening. They weren't the most rigorous, since my daily work habits fluctuate, but most days I use the same thing: one or two dozen browser tabs for Google Docs, Gmail, Google Calendar, Twitter, Facebook, blog posts and other information sources; Slack for work chitchat; and Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop for short bursts of photo editing. Apple's Safari browser fared a little better than Chrome, which did better than Brave, which did better than Firefox, but none did well. I edit lots of photos outside work, which is why I bought such an expensive machine in the first place, but Lightroom lasted only three hours on the battery. Things were bad enough that I started carrying a Microsoft Surface Book when I knew I'd be working out of the office. It's slower at photo editing than the Mac, but it lasted all day on battery. The MacOS 10.12.3 update that fixed Consumer Reports' complaint didn't help. But Apple did. My initial interactions with Apple, including hours on the phone with tech support and two trips to stores to get my hardware evaluated, yielded only comic relief: One Apple-authorized repair store asked if I had a USB-C dongle so it could run a test, and Apple's own Genius Bar had to hook two dongles together to connect my Mac to their network cable. Eventually, though, we got to the heart of the problem. Hopes restored Screen brightness turned out to be the biggest factor in getting my battery back -- much more than I'd expected. The new 2016 MacBook Pro screen is 67 percent brighter than its predecessor's, and I'd been running it bright. Sure enough, dialing it down made a world of difference. I get 10 hours most days at a brightness setting of 8 to 10 out of 16. When using Safari and an uncomfortably dim setting of 5 or 6, I got 12 hours. The 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar lets you dim the laptop's screen to save power. James Martin/CNET Screen dimming isn't a new idea. But it may make more of a difference here. Although the new MacBook Pro's screen is 30 percent more efficient, it can run brighter, and the new model has a smaller 76 watt-hour battery, compared with 99.5 watt-hours on the 2015 model and 95 watt-hours for my 2012 predecessor. I learned more from Apple -- like avoiding USB devices when possible. For me, the guilty parties were my Ethernet dongle, memory card reader and external hard drives -- even though the drives had their own power supplies. The problem is that any of these devices wake up the parts of the computer's communication system that otherwise snooze in a low-power state. Stick with Wi-Fi when you can. Also on the list is the keyboard backlight -- dim it or shut it off -- and dongles with built-in chips, for example to convert video signals to HDMI. They might not consume much, but it all adds up. After all, the glowing Apple logo on earlier Mac laptop lids didn't consume much power either, but efficiency is one one reason Apple scrapped it. Also, when possible, avoid software that uses the separate but more power-hungry high-performance graphics chip that's now standard in 15-inch MacBook Pros. Adobe's Lightroom, Photoshop and Acrobat each demand this high-performance GPU (I monitored with the handy gfxCardStatus utility) even when they're idling in the background, and non-Safari browsers are more likely to fire it up. Some sites, like Google Maps, keep it on and leave it on, while others only flip it on for a few seconds. So close browser tabs and software you're not using. Apple doesn't let Safari use the high-performance GPU, a battery-saving restriction. That can cause problems with graphics-intense sites -- a rougher time moving around in Google Maps' 3D view, for example, or slower frame rates on the ShaderToy site. But it's easy to see why Apple made the decision it did. Chrome is working to deliver the best of both worlds, with updates to be gentler on the GPU, for example by using the lower-power GPU more often and switching tabs to it when they're in the background. Reducing power usage is a "top priority for Chrome in 2017," said Chrome product manager Rachel Popkin. "We have a bunch of people working on it." And Adobe expects improvements that will optimize how its software uses graphics chips to improve battery life on Macs, the company said. That's great news. For me, the improvements can't come soon enough. Because I may be happier than a month ago, but I'm still not leaving my laptop charger at home. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter.

It automatically styles any website using the material design guidelines with pre-built CSS and JS. React.js: 14 Tools & Resources for Web Developers React.js: 14 Tools & Resources for Web Developers The popularity of React.js has been rapidly growing since Facebook first released the library back in 2013. It's‚Ä¶Read more This is a popular framework for simple dev projects. React MDL combines Google‚Äôs framework with the React library to make a well-rounded frontend resource. Google‚Äôs material design is clearly the future of UI/UX in the world of Google. And with Material Design Lite it‚Äôs easier than ever to implement these features onto any website with a proprietary open source library. React is also by far the most popular frontend JS framework used for frontend view components. With React MDL you can merge these React components with the MDL library to get a view much like you‚Äôll find in Google‚Äôs online documentation. Here‚Äôs a sample article template so you can get a feel of how this looks. This page doesn‚Äôt have many React components but it demonstrates the aesthetic of material design. You‚Äôll find a lot more action on this demo built using React components. You can actually find more info about Material Design Lite on the GitHub repo if you‚Äôre curious to learn more. From there you can download the raw CSS and JS to implement into your page which automatically supports all modern browsers and graceful degradation. Unfortunately since React MDL is still fairly new it doesn‚Äôt have full support for all components. But you can see a full list here including small demos for each one. This also includes bits of source code that you can copy/paste into your own projects as needed. I would not recommend learning React MDL until you already feel comfortable with both libraries. The Material Design Lite suite is pretty simple to start but React is much more complex. To learn more about MDL check out the FAQ page on their official site. It offers tips on where to use MDL, which features it offers, and how it can fit into a typical webdev workflow. But truthfully even if you don‚Äôt understand React very well you can still get by with all the samples on the components page. For example the textfield page has working textfields using material design but with React code snippets. Feel free to play around and see what you can build. Both libraries are completely free and open source for all projects whether personal or commercial. You can find out more from the React MDL GitHub page if you want to study the source and dive in.

The company has now rolled out a new update for Assistant on Google Pixel, which introduces a new feature called "Home Control", allowing it to control smart home devices like Philips Hue, Honeywell, Belkin‚Äôs WeMo, Nest, and Samsung SmartThings. "Home Control" on Google Assistant With the introduction of this feature, you do not need to invest $129 for Google Home. Home Control brings the ability to control all the devices from one place, eradicating the need to manage separate dedicated apps for each device. Furthermore, users can also give Assistant voice commands in order to control their smart home devices. You can manually access Home Control by simply going into the settings of Google Assistant and tapping "Home Control". This will display a list of synchronized devices - more devices can also be added using the "+" symbol at the bottom. Currently, only Pixel and Pixel XL owners can utilize this feature. With Google's plans to roll out Assistant to more devices in the future, the LG G6 may be next in line to sport it along with Android TV, if rumors are to be believed.

Tom Regan, @grapedosmil 02.14.17 in Internet Comments 2102 Shares Share Tweet Share Save After years spent attempting to clean the internet's murky waters, Google's latest transparency report reveals it has now received takedown requests for over a million different sites. With its individual URL removal request count now reaching the billions, these new figures suggest that pirates now have more options than ever when it comes to stealing digital cargo. The number of takedown requests are up significantly from last year, thanks in part to copyright-holder's increasingly widespread use of algorithms that automatically inform Google of copyright-infringing content. While the numbers are staggering, it's hardly surprising that the world's most popular search engine gets inundated with requests to remove illegal content from its search results. What is unexpected, however, is that the report shows sites like The White House and The U.S Department of Justice have had repeated requests to remove their content. The U.S Government isn't alone though, with legitimate sites like NASA, Netflix, the BBC and The New York Times also regularly making the naughty list. Some of these baffling requests can of course, be chalked down to copyright software errors, but interestingly, Google's transparency reports also expose governments that are trying to censor certain content. With political articles and videos regularly coming under fire from governments around the world, transparency reports allow citizens to easily keep tabs on their government. Other reports, however, are less nefarious. A site that's no stranger to being unjustly harassed by copyright holders is the movie database site, IMDB. Where most legitimate sites get accidental reports in the dozens, In recent years the popular movie page has had requests to remove over 1000 of its URLs. Unsurprisingly, Google refused to remove the site's URLs from search results. Still, the vast majority of these copyright infringements can undoubtedly be linked with a rise in piracy. With US internet service providers recently abandoning their piracy warning system before the UK has even implemented the policy, it seems as though making piracy sites harder to find is currently many rights' holders best option.

But six-year-old "startup" Uber -- valued at an estimated $68 billion -- doesn't rely on fun, quirky perks to attract employees. In fact, despite its reputation for for long hours and a limited work-life balance, Uber has enticed some of the most brilliant minds in tech to leave cushy jobs at Google, Facebook and Twitter. The breakneck pace can be grueling, employees admit, but they say Uber offers unique opportunities: "rocket ship" growth, the chance to solve real-world problems and a culture that frees them to experiment with radical solutions in a burgeoning field. "I like to use the analogy of diamonds, which are compressed with heat and pressure for thousands of years," Uber CTO Thuan Pham told CNNTech. "Those who can actually survive and thrive from it come out as diamonds." Uber's San Francisco headquarters is dotted with one-year anniversary balloons tied to worker desks -- a sign that the company is adding an enormous amount of new employees. Uber now employs 10,000 full-time (non-driver) workers and operates in more than 500 cities in 70 countries. "If you're going to leave, people do so within the first year because the pace isn't what they expected or what they're used to," said Neal Narayani, Uber's head of people analytics. Among those who left within the first 12 months is Melanie Curtain, who worked at Uber's Washington, D.C., office as a community manager in 2013. She compared the company's culture to ducks swimming on a pond: seemingly calm from above and working tirelessly under water. "It wasn't unusual to sign online and see people working after midnight and on weekends," she said. "The culture isn't imposed; it just exists. I knew what I was getting into, but it wasn't for me." Narayani agrees: "You have to be a bit of an adrenaline junkie to work here." He himself skydives in his free time. What's more, people with successful backgrounds -- valedictorians and those who have always done well in their careers -- often fail, "possibly for the first times in their lives," Narayani said. Still, Uber can't keep up with job applications, according to Narayani. It has a 4.2 rating on job review site Glassdoor, compared to the average company rating of 3.3. (However, drivers give Uber a 2.9 rating.) Tech companies in general maintain a high approval rate on the site: Facebook earns a 4.5 and Google a 4.4. The rocket ship When CEO Travis Kalanick launched Uber in March 2009, the company faced a steep learning curve. Challenges ranged from dealing with local city regulations and hiring reliable drivers to developing a loyal rider base and scaling at an astronomical rate. Critics have also called Uber's ethics into question. Staffers allegedly posed as Lyft customers to cancel rides and poach drivers, and an executive revealed plans to dig up personal dirt on reporters critical of Uber. More recently, a lawsuit claimed employees misused the platform to track high-profile politicians and celebrities. But Uber's popularity on the ground continues to grow. Although it has emerged from its DIY roots, insiders say the culture and pace have remained relatively intact since the beginning. For example, not long after Andi Pimentel -- chief of staff to chief business officer Emil Michael -- joined Uber in 2012, she was approached by Kalanick, who knew she was from Mexico City. He wanted her to help him launch there. Along with four colleagues, she booked a one-way ticket to Mexico City. In a sort of grassroots effort, the group explained to individual riders how Uber worked, recruited drivers and translated the app into Spanish. Mexico City soon became the company's first Latin American market. "We are much more sophisticated now, but it's things like this that attract people to Uber," Pimental said. "My grandmother, who can't drive, now uses it every Sunday to go to the grocery store in Mexico City. What you work on will have a direct impact on people's lives." When Pham, the Uber CTO, joined from cloud management firm VMware in 2013, he had one mission: Re-engineer the app's code so it could handle extreme growth. Because the app was originally developed by engineers with only a few years of experience, the foundation wasn't suitable for scaling quickly. "What Uber has on top of pace, speed and the cutting-edge aspect of what we do is the compressed timeline -- it forces us to learn quickly and perform at a very high level," Pham said. "A normal [year] here doesn't compare to years somewhere else." As the company has grown, Kalanick keeps his hands in almost every department. He's described as "an approachable leader," but Pham said he also gives autonomy to those he trusts. "[Travis] drives things really hard and has impossibly high expectations," Pham said. "But if he sees the team and an individual make progress -- and there is a history of that -- he pulls back. That is the only way a company can grow this fast." Work-life balance At Uber's start, the company's mostly millennial workforce wasn't married and didn't have children, allowing for more time in the office. That changed as the company expanded -- and grew up. Pham -- who endures a five-hour commute each day traveling to and from San Jose -- tries to make it home by 9 p.m. to see his 10-year-old daughter before bedtime. "I sometimes get back online after," said Pham, who explained his family can't move because his wife's medical practice is based in San Jose. "It takes a village to make it work. I take my daughter to school in the morning and my wife does the afternoon activities." Janelle Sallenave, Uber's head of North America support operations, said her most difficult moment at the company happened this past fall, not long after the relaunch of the rider app. After she flagged the app's slow customer service to Kalanick, the company determined the process needed to be 50 times faster. "T.K. being T.K. said, 'I totally get these issues. Let's get it solved next week,'" she said. "It was like redesigning it from scratch. It was exhausting and exhilarating at the same time. In one week, we had to do something that would have taken four to five months to do somewhere else." Seven days later, Sallenave's team was getting customer inquiries to the right expert within a few minutes, regardless of which office they worked in. "Uber is like dog years ... it's a rocket ship," she said. "When we see something that could move the platform forward, we take the opportunity to do it." Sallenave will soon celebrate her first work anniversary after leaving a consulting job at Charles Schwab. Colleagues were shocked when they learned she was taking a job at Uber. Before taking the job, she discussed with her husband what the role might mean for her home life. Now, she misses dinner with her family a few times a month, but she maintains balance by focusing on work when at work, and home when at home. "When I'm here, I am not stopping to chit chat with a girlfriend," she said. "I wonder how much Cyber Monday was happening at Uber. Probably very little." She also discovered a different Uber on the inside. "Uber is actually warm, friendly and wonderful," she said. "It's not an intense man cave -- that's what people [from the outside] were telling me. These people are smart and they make me want to be smarter." Still, the most common "con" listed on Uber's Glassdoor page is the lack of work-life balance. A former San Francisco-based Uber employee, who spoke to CNNTech on the condition of anonymity, said many engineers complained about being burned out -- and it was hard to be "off the clock" when messages rolled in late. "Uber is going through considerable growing pains as it attempts to transition from a largely decentralized company that knows how to sprint into new markets to one that's more mature, centralized and needs to support its people better," he said. "[Travis'] libertarian ethos runs deep in the culture: Your success is largely contingent on your ability to elbow other people in the face on your way to success." Finding the right fit Uber is especially interested in hiring former entrepreneurs; it currently employs about 200. Before joining the company, Ed Baker -- VP of growth -- founded two dating sites, one of which was acquired by Facebook in 2011 for an undisclosed amount. Baker later spent two years at Facebook focused on growing competitive markets such as Japan and Russia. "I wasn't planning to leave Facebook, but I was attracted to Uber because it's a place for entrepreneurs to be entrepreneurs," said Baker, who met Kalanick at one of the CEO's famous "idea jam sessions" at his home. "Uber today probably feels how Facebook felt years ago," he said. "It's small and chaotic because we are growing so quickly and there is so much going on. You have to be comfortable with that uncertainty." To pick candidates with the right background and personality, Uber built an internal algorithm for the recruiting team that it couples with an extensive vetting process. "I like raw answers. I walk away from people who are too polished," said Komal Mangtani, director of engineering. While employees at other companies may work hard because a manager encourages them to do so, Mangtani said the mentality and approach is different at Uber. "These are real-world problems that need to be solved, whether it's looking into a safety incident or making sure drivers get paid on time so they can pay rent," said Mangtani. But Curtain, the early employee who left just shy of a year, said Uber's desire to "win" in all areas included attracting and keeping talent. "Years ago, someone close to the top discussed Uber's health care policy in a meeting," Curtain said. "He said, 'We would never want to lose talent to another company because they had better healthcare.'" "My impression wasn't so much that it was about keeping employees healthy but about getting and maintaining the best people. Yes, they want to make sure its staff is taken care of, but they want to also win at everything." Taking it personally Despite Uber's success, it's never too far from controversy. Maya Choksi, senior product manager on the driver app, has seen Uber face mountains of issues since she joined in 2012. "The hardest moments [for me] involve negative media attention," she said. "[It] doesn't feel at all reflective of what is happening at the office or what people are trying to do. The intentions can get misconstrued." Recent bad press includes an outcry over Uber's response to Trump's immigration ban. The company turned off surge pricing during a protest at JFK airport in New York City, a move the company said was meant to help protesters get a ride home. But many users assumed it was to capitalize on a taxi stoppage, and #DeleteUber trended widely on social media as people deleted the app from their phones. Choksi said Uber's teams take these incidents personally. Choksi cited one early example: Uber planned to charge riders a fee when drivers were kept waiting, in an effort to ensure drivers were fairly compensated. But users weren't happy, and negative headlines followed. "Those negative moments don't feel good," she said. "I get calls from my family saying, 'Is Uber really like this?' And you feel like you have to defend yourself." But Choksi, like other Uber employees who shared their stories with CNNTech, said both internal and public failures aren't looked down upon at the company. "Because we are solving problems without having other examples to look at, we are encouraged to fail fast and learn and keep tackling," Choksi said.

Over the past couple of years, the company has been consistently updating its app store, adding new features and enhancing existing ones. It lowered the minimum app pricing in 17 countries back in 2015, made some big UI changes, and also introduced a technique which could make the size of app updates smaller by up to 90%. Now, it appears that Google is testing some new improvements in the Play Store, which aren't widespread as of yet. Android Authority reports that the Google Play Store is listing both the sale and original prices of discounted apps. Additionally, it is displaying how long a particular sale will last as well. It's also interesting to note that these "features" were already available in the movies, books, and music sections on the Play Store. However, for some reason, they didn't make it over to the apps and games category. That said, it is worth noting that the alterations don't appear to be quite widespread yet. Only a few discounted apps and games - most of them being DC-themed - are currently showcasing the changes. The changes also appear to carry over to the web listings on Chrome, as can be seen from the photo above. Furthermore, it also seems that Google is lifting the ban which forbade developers to temporarily offer their apps for free, before returning them to their original prices. However, like the aforementioned change, this appears to be limited to only a few apps too. In contrast, it is interesting to see that the Windows Store has boasted these features for quite some time. Play Store customers will likely welcome the changes as a means to improve the overall user experience as well.

In August of 2016, Google announced that they would be rolling out an update on January 10, 2017, that could impact URLs employing intrusive mobile popups or interstitials. For example, if a URL¬†presented an interstitial that covered a substantial part of the content, then that URL could be demoted in the mobile search results. The web as a whole cheered, as many users were extremely frustrated by aggressive mobile popups. So, as January approached, many SEOs, webmasters and business owners wondered what the actual impact would be. Would there be mass casualties, minor bumps in the algorithmic road or something in between? Based on Google‚Äôs announcement, you would think that sites employing intrusive popups or interstitials would have gotten smoked by the algorithm. That would make sense, but when you‚Äôre dealing in an algorithmic world, the devil is in the details. Preparing for the mobile popup algorithm As the rollout neared, I had many questions. Would the update actually work?¬†How extreme would it be? Would there be loopholes? How would it impact branded versus non-branded queries? Would large-scale sites be impacted as much as smaller sites? And¬†so on and so forth. That‚Äôs why I prepared for the update by collecting as many sites using mobile popups or interstitials as possible. My goal was to benchmark those sites and then gauge the impact as the mobile popup algorithm rolled out.¬†I‚Äôm now tracking close to 70 domains on my mobile popup list¬†‚Äî and those sites are across verticals, including news publishers, entertainment, sports, e-commerce retailers, bloggers, music and more. Starting on January 10, I began checking my list twice per day to see which sites were still breaking the rules and which ones weren‚Äôt. And for the ones breaking the new Google mobile popup law, how much negative impact would they see? Would they see¬†any impact at all? My travels along the popup algorithm trail My research took me across many sites, both large and small, across many categories and locations. It was fascinating to see which sites raised the white flag and stopped using popups or interstitials and which ones stood their ground and kept them. It was also eye-opening¬†to analyze the various ways websites employed popups and interstitials in this new world (if they kept them). It was enlightening, to say the least. And of course, I was able to see many different types of ads and interstitials, including benign newsletter signups, aggressive ads that take over your screen, autoplay video in popups, broken ads in popups, and even malware and malicious downloads from ads in popups. There were times I felt like I needed battle armor while visiting some sites. Credit:¬†Giphy Below, I‚Äôll cover the impact, the non-impact, the natural side effects of a preannounced Google algorithm update, examples of popups and interstitials, and other interesting notes. So join me on a ride through mobile popup land. January 10, 2017: The rollout begins When the rollout began, I was excited to check my list and determine if there was any impact. As you can guess, there wasn‚Äôt much to report on the first day. The algorithm had to fully roll out, so I began checking my list twice per day to gauge the impact. And as I was checking the mobile SERPs, I ended up finding even more sites using mobile popups and interstitials. So my list was naturally growing as time went on. On January 12, I noticed what I believed were the first signs of impact, and I wrote a post to document my findings. My plan was to keep adding findings to that post as I came across more and more impact. Well, that didn‚Äôt turn out very well. After some initial movement, there seemed to be very little impact (if any at all). I kept updating my post with disclaimers about the lack of impact I was seeing. I was floored. I thought for sure the domains I was tracking would see some movement, but I was wrong. I checked twice per day, only to see many of the URLs from those domains ranking exactly where they did prior to the rollout. As of today, I‚Äôm still not seeing widespread impact. Again, many of the URLs across the domains I‚Äôm tracking are ranking exactly where they did prior to the rollout of the mobile popup algorithm. Therefore, I‚Äôm officially calling the mobile popup algorithm a dud. Sure, that can change if Google strengthens the algorithm or refines it, but for now, it‚Äôs not doing very much. Examples of popups and interstitials still in use You might be wondering what I‚Äôm seeing when checking sites. Well, I‚Äôve seen it all since January 10: newsletter signups, popups on scroll, delayed popups, multi-ad interstitials, autoplay video, broken popups, malware, malicious downloads, multiple popups on one page, and so on. Without revealing the sites, here is a potpourri of popups and interstitials I have come across during my travels. These are all¬†from URLs that currently rank highly for competitive keywords¬†‚Äî and ranked there before the algorithm update rolled out. Also, the desktop and mobile rankings are equivalent. In other words, I‚Äôm not seeing a drop in the mobile SERPs when compared to desktop, which would happen if the mobile popup algorithm were impacting rankings. I‚Äôll see you on the other side. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôll cover the true impact of the mobile popup algorithm ‚Äî and it might not be what you‚Äôre thinking. And many more‚Ä¶ The true impact of the mobile popup algorithm Well, the true impact has nothing to do with mobile rankings being impacted, a slide in mobile traffic or anything related to SEO. Instead, it has everything to do with the reaction of publishers to the news that the algorithm was going to roll out. For example, many publishers removed mobile popups and interstitials as January 10, 2017, approached. They simply didn‚Äôt want to get hit or test the algorithmic waters. I saw this a lot as I was collecting sites that were employing mobile popups. This also included sites removing the popups after January 10. Not every company knew about the algorithm update, so some were late to the game. My guess is that the algorithm got on their radar based on news of the rollout, so those publishers had a knee-jerk reaction and simply removed their popups without gauging the actual impact. They basically trusted that the mobile popup algorithm was working without evidence of it actually working. And I get that. If you‚Äôre not neck-deep in SEO, you might not be familiar with the gray area of algorithms, and you might not know that some algorithm updates simply don‚Äôt work as expected. For those people, they just knew it was rolling out, that it could potentially negatively impact their rankings and traffic, and they pulled the popups and interstitials from their sites. But like I said earlier, the devil is in the details. Again, I‚Äôm not seeing any widespread impact from the mobile popup algorithm as I write this post. High risk, high reward: Will Google turn up the dial? And here‚Äôs the rub. The publishers I mentioned earlier that stood their ground and refused to remove their mobile popups and interstitials have braved the mighty tsunami that never arrived. They stood on the beach facing a powerful surge of water that would surely suck the mobile life out of their sites‚Ä¶ and nothing happened. But that‚Äôs for now. Google can absolutely turn up the dial and strengthen the mobile popup algorithm at any time. And if they do, then those sites using mobile popups or interstitials could get smoked. But that‚Äôs a big could. Now, I‚Äôm not saying mobile popups are a good thing. I actually can‚Äôt stand most of them, and users overall hate them. That should be enough to rid them from the web, but they do work conversion-wise (unfortunately). So, we have a situation where an algorithm that should impact URLs employing mobile popups is not living up to expectations, and a marketing tactic that drives conversion was removed from many sites. I don‚Äôt know where we go from here, but I fear more sites will test the algorithmic waters and add those popups back. And it‚Äôs hard to blame them. So, based on what I explained in this post, I‚Äôll provide some closing points below. Key points Although there hasn‚Äôt been widespread impact yet, Google can turn up the dial at any time. I know many people are still hoping that happens; and if it does, sites using mobile popups or interstitials can get hit. Remember, high risk, high reward. Publishers are still figuring out ways to push the envelope with mobile popups in order to determine which formats and techniques will get hit and which ones won‚Äôt. But based on my research, there‚Äôs very little negative impact overall so far. I recommend watching my initial post for more updates. Never simply take Google‚Äôs word for it. Track and test updates for yourself. I‚Äôm glad I decided to gather close to 70 sites using mobile popups and interstitials. That enabled me to test how strong the algorithm was and if it was doing what it was supposed to do. Mobile popups and interstitials are horrible user experience-wise, but they perform well conversion-wise. Based on the lack of impact from the mobile popup algorithm, I fear we will see more sites testing the waters and adding them back. It pains me to say that‚Ä¶ but the lack of impact is clear. Summary: The waiting continues When January 10 arrived, I was eager to gauge the impact of the mobile popup algorithm. But what I wasn‚Äôt prepared for was to see very little happen. And that‚Äôs exactly what occurred while checking many sites still using mobile popups and interstitials. Moving forward, keep an eye on my Twitter feed and my original findings post. I will keep checking my list, and checking it twice, in order to see if the mobile popup algorithm is being naughty or nice.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Allo vs. iMessage: Which one does it best? Apps & Games Featuresby A.J. Hartless2 days ago 132 690 47 Messaging apps are like fine wine ‚Äì they get better with age. Or, at least in the case of the two we‚Äôre looking at here ‚Äì Google Allo and iMessage ‚Äì that seems to be the case. Similes aside, with the launch of Google Allo late last year, and with the most recent updates to iMessage in iOS 10, it‚Äôs hard not to draw clear commonalities and stark differences between the two and wonder which one is actually the superior app. Yes, I know, this is Android Authority, and you don‚Äôt come here to read about Apple, but if Google has any hope of gaining market share in the world of interactive, rich messaging, they might have a thing or two to learn from Apple‚Äôs long-standing app. So, let‚Äôs take a quick look: Google Allo vs. iMessage. User Interface Let‚Äôs start by taking a look at the overall design, ease-of-use and fluidity of the apps. No matter what capabilities your app offers, I‚Äôm not inclined to use it unless it‚Äôs easy on the eyes, easy to figure out, and simply a joy to use. Fortunately, Google Allo and Apple‚Äôs iMessage both check off those boxes, but let‚Äôs take a look at some more of the specifics. Allo If you‚Äôve used any of Google‚Äôs other apps like Hangouts or Inbox, you won‚Äôt find any surprises in Allo. You‚Äôve got the standard hamburger menu where you‚Äôll find your application and profile settings, and a floating action button to start a new conversation. Inside of conversations, you‚Äôll find a very Nougat-esque design language, with the pill-shaped text bar that is a bit less harsh than the hard corners you‚Äôll find in something like Google‚Äôs SMS app, Messenger. For a little added flair, you can change up the theme of your conversations for more fun background designs and message bubble colors. It‚Äôs a small feature, but goes a long way towards making the app more fun to use. iMessage Given that iMessage has been around for so long at this point, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll know what to expect when opening the app. Speaking of fluidity, there is no arguing that Apple goes above and beyond to create a uniform experience inside of their ‚Äústock‚Äù apps, and iMessage is no different. The brilliance of the iMessage application comes from its level of polish everywhere you look. Every animation, every menu, every button ‚Äì you can tell that no detail was left unexplored to ensure that you get the best experience possible. The iMessage application embodies what users have come to expect of Apple, a reliable, well-thought, buttoned-up experience.

At their core, both Google Allo and iMessage are simply messaging apps, but it‚Äôs their features, and lack thereof in some cases, that set them apart. Obviously, iMessage is an Apple exclusive, and Allo was designed with Android in mind, but let‚Äôs look beyond that. Allo When Allo was announced early in 2016, its primary draw was, of course, Google Assistant. Assistant, the evolved state of Google Now, is intertwined within the app, able to be accessed from within conversations to pull relevant information such as weather, locations, movie showtimes, etc. At first, it kind of seems gimmicky to be texting with a virtual assistant, but after a while of using the app, it‚Äôs actually pretty convenient to have Google ready when you need it during any conversation. Google Assistant also exists as its own ‚Äòcontact‚Äô in Allo, with which you can have standalone conversations. Here, you can basically query information like you would from the Google app, but your results will be returned in a more conversational manner. Assistant shines in this context by alerting you of reminders, sending you information like weather forecasts on a daily basis, and more. The conversational manner of Assistant also allows you to ask subsequent questions in context to get more information. For example, you can ask Google ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs tomorrow‚Äôs forecast?‚Äù and you will receive a nice visual representation of what you asked for. Then, you can immediately follow up with ‚ÄúWhat about this weekend?‚Äù Google will recognize that your second question is related to the first, and will return the additional information. Furthermore, Allo‚Äôs suggested responses that appear automatically above the keyboard make getting more information from Assistant incredibly easy to do with little input. iMessage Let‚Äôs start with the basics ‚Äì iMessage supports SMS. Sounds like a no-brainer, but given that Allo does not, it‚Äôs definitely worth noting. So yes, you can text anyone from iMessage, you just won‚Äôt be able to use some of its key features. Apple‚Äôs iMessage is a solid messaging app, no question about it. However, it doesn‚Äôt really have one ‚Äòmain draw‚Äô like that of Google Allo. But, the fact is, it doesn‚Äôt need one. Unlike Android devices, iPhone‚Äôs comes with an excellent¬†messaging application out of the box. One that‚Äôs packed full of features, and usually is enough to keep users from seeking an alternative. Many of iMessage‚Äôs flagship features focus on making conversations with your peers more intimate (in the innocent sense of the word) and personal. For instance, if you want to send a message to your wife saying, ‚ÄúI love you!‚Äù, you can add an animated heart balloon that will begin its animation when she views the message. Other examples of this include confetti that takes over the screen, party balloons that float up from the bottom of the screen, fireworks exploding in the background, a shooting star, and more. These message enhancements are taken a step further with actions such as Slam; powerful and large text bubbles, Whisper; smaller and gentle text bubbles, Invisible Ink; keeps text and photos hidden until tapped, and more. One of the coolest features of iMessage is the ability to replace words in your message with emojis. So if you type ‚ÄúWant to grab pizza tonight?‚Äù, the word ‚Äòpizza‚Äô will be highlighted as yellow text, and upon touching the word, will be replaced with a pizza emoji. On top of that, the App Store specific to iMessage has a ton of applications that enhance the experience of the app by giving you access to more stickers, the ability to make payments and more. It‚Äôs hard to name a clear winner in this category since the applications share the same basic messaging functionality, as well as some others, such as the ability to send photos and videos, audio clips, stickers (with additional packs available for download) and real-time location sharing. However, when it comes to sheer volume of the things you can do with the app, iMessage edges out Google Allo. It‚Äôs very clear how much time and attention Apple has put into its messaging application, and if taken full advantage of, iMessage is a really enjoyable communication application to use. Related Articles ¬† Facebook may be coming to a TV set-top box near you2 weeks ago ¬† Snapseed version 2.15 adds new curves tool and more2 weeks ago Backup and Privacy Privacy isn‚Äôt something we think about all the time when it comes to texting back and forth with friends, but the truth is, any information that falls in the wrong hands can spell bad news. So, what do iMessage and Allo offer in the way of privacy? And, what are your backup options if you ever to need to restore your messages at a later time? Allo Do you remember all that fuss about Google Allo indefinitely storing your messages to improve the app? Even Edward Snowden joined the conversation. Well yeah, that‚Äôs a thing. Messages you send with Google are protected from online predators by being scrambled from the time you send them to the time they reach Google‚Äôs servers, and again from the servers to the recipient, but Google does keep normal messages sent from Allo for their special use. Doing so allows Google‚Äôs messaging app to create those handy quick reply suggestions, as well as power Google Assistant. However, if you are concerned with your privacy, you can use Allo‚Äôs Incognito Chat to ensure your messages are encrypted end-to-end, so only you and the recipient can read the message. Incognito Chat also has a pretty cool self-destruct feature (called ‚Äúexpiration‚Äù in the app) that gives you the ability to have your messages disappear from your device, as well as the recipient‚Äôs, in a set amount of time. The amount of time can range anywhere from 5 seconds to 1 week. Backing up messages in Allo is something that definitely needs some work to say the least. Many users (including myself) have complained that when switching to a new device, you lose all of of your previous messages, even after linking the same Google account and phone number. Given that Google is storing your conversations for other reasons, you‚Äôd think they would at least let you sync your message between different devices, but unfortunately that‚Äôs not an option. iMessage iMessage doesn‚Äôt have any real privacy settings, but that‚Äôs because Apple swears by its built-in privacy. Conversations in iMessage are encrypted end-to-end, and Apple says they will never store or scan messages for their own use ‚Äì preventing them, or anyone else, from ever invading your privacy. As you‚Äôve likely heard about during recent events, Apple doesn‚Äôt create any ‚Äúbackdoors‚Äù with their products because that ‚Äúundermines the protections‚Äù they‚Äôve put in. The only two real privacy options you have with iMessage is the ability to choose how long your messages are stored; forever, a year or 30 days, and, how you would like your message previews to be displayed on the device. When it comes to backing up your messages, there‚Äôs not much to worry about. There is a ton to complain about when talking about iCloud, but you can count on your iMessage conversations being backed up and accessible in multiple ways. If you get a new iPhone, iPad or Mac, you‚Äôll immediately find your previous conversations right where you left them. As part of their privacy promise, however, you can opt to not have your messages stored at all if having them later is something you aren‚Äôt concerned with. Major Complaints No app is without its flaws. Allo Oh, where to start. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like Allo. I really like it, but it has a long way to go before it will be what most people want it to be. To start, there is no SMS support. This is likely the biggest complaint among all users, because without true SMS support, Allo can‚Äôt replace your other messaging applications. Sure, you can send SMS messages to people who aren‚Äôt Allo users, but there‚Äôs a catch. Instead of your message coming from you, the person you‚Äôre texting will get a message from a random 5-digit number. They‚Äôll only know it‚Äôs you by seeing your name, followed by a colon, at the beginning of each message. On top of that, any Assistant-enabled functions you use in that conversation will come through as a vomit of links and special characters. I can promise this will come across as annoying to the recipient. Allo also has no desktop client. So for those of us who sit in front of a computer for the majority of the day, this is a huge disappointment. Sure, you could use Hangouts, but what‚Äôs the point in using two different messaging apps when you could just use one? With iMessage, your messages are synced across your other devices, including macOS. So that might satisfy your need for a desktop¬†client. In my opinion, Allo is sort of facing an identity crisis, and Google is struggling to figure out where it fits in. Their long-running chat application, Hangouts, has a huge user-base given that it is built in to GMail, and the Android application has 1 BILLION+ installs (granted it comes pre-installed on many devices.) Hangouts can be used as a default SMS application, but you also have Google Messenger which is a dedicated SMS app with 50,000,000+ installs. So, Google already has a dedicated chat app, and a dedicated SMS app, so that begs the question ‚Äì why introduce something brand new instead of improving on what you already have?¬†For me, I was expecting a full-fledged text messaging app that could replace what I currently use. But, what I got was a glorified chat app with some really cool baked-in goodies (i.e. Google Assistant). iMessage I‚Äôm honestly having a hard time finding things to complain about for iMessage. For the most part, it‚Äôs a pretty polished app. But, like I said, no app is perfect. As an Android user and long-time fan, one of the reasons I don‚Äôt use an iPhone is because of the lack of customization. iMessage mimics that experience for me. There is no option to customize your conversations between different contacts with various colors, and you can‚Äôt change the background of your conversations, other than using screen effects mentioned earlier. My other complaint with iMessage is the slight learning curve when trying to grow accustomed to the many features available. For instance, to access the text enhancement features ‚Äì Slam, Whisper, Invisible Ink, etc ‚Äì you have to force touch the send button. But to access the stickers, GIFs, and other apps, you look in the iMessage App Store menu. To send heartbeats, kiss effects, etc. ‚Äì that‚Äôs another menu. And finally, if you want to send a handwritten message, you have to flip the phone horizontally to reveal the sketchpad. Bottom line ‚Äì there are just too many features in too many places. Until you‚Äôve had considerable amount of time to play around, you might find yourself hunting for a certain feature. Lastly, I mentioned how iMessage syncs across all of your Apple devices, but what if you don‚Äôt have a Mac? In this case, you‚Äôll have no means of using iMessage from your computer. This is especially frustrating considering that almost all other iCloud applications are available to access and use at iCloud.com, including Notes, Reminders, Photos, Calendar, and more. So why, Apple? Why haven‚Äôt you made¬†iMessage accessible with an online interface? Conclusion ¬† So, how do we wrap this all up? Well, I‚Äôm not going to call a clear winner here because I like both apps for different reasons. Sure, if we‚Äôre talking sheer volume of features, and level of polish, iMessage takes the cake, but the truth is, I have just as much fun using Allo as I do iMessage. And for me, that‚Äôs really what it‚Äôs about. For Google Allo, I think the problem lies in how it was launched, how it was positioned at launch, and what users thought they were going to get, but didn‚Äôt. For Allo to pick up any steam, and gain more market share among the other messaging apps, Google needs to make this clear to consumers. Google Assistant is an excellent selling feature, but without being able to text other people not using the app, why would users adopt this vs. Google Messenger? And, with no desktop interface, why would anyone adopt Allo instead of Hangouts? As for iMessage, it clearly has its place in Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. You have it on your phone, you have it on your iPad, you have it on your Mac. Your messages sync across devices, are backed up for when you get a new device, and there are ton of cool features to make sure you‚Äôre always having fun. But, iMessage is missing that one BIG THING to really sell it. Maybe if Apple could improve Siri (on a couple of different levels) and integrate it into iMessage, similar to that of Google Assistant in Allo, there would be more of draw to the application. Fortunately for Apple, they have a leg up with the app being installed on every device. No need for them to worry about consumers having to beg their friends to jump on the bandwagon. They‚Äôre already there. What are your thoughts on this subject? Will Google Allo ever be the iMessage of the Android world? Are the features in Google Allo enough to keep you interested and to make you try to convince your friends to join you? Let us know in the comments below!

According to Bloomberg early staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersized payouts based on the project‚Äôs value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members didn‚Äôt need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities. In December Google created a standalone business called Waymo, and the system was replaced with a more uniform pay structure that treats all employees the same. However it looks like that the previous system did a lot of damage to the entire project. In 2010, soon after Google unveiled its first self-driving vehicle, the search engine hit on a wizard wheeze to tie employees‚Äô fortunes to the project‚Äôs performance rather than Google‚Äôs advertising money machine. In addition to cash salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity. After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. The multiplier was based on periodic valuations of the division, the people said. However, the bonuses started to get out of control as the project matured. Some found themselves collecting multi-million dollar payments. One member of the team had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed over four years, one of the people said. The payouts increased after key milestones were reached, even though the ultimate goal of the project was years from being finished. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts last year that operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion, ‚Äúprimarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago.‚Äù But people were not sticking around. Staff departures from the car division actually increased in 2016. Some were frustrated with the pace of progress and had doubts about new leader John Krafcik, while others wanted to start their own autonomous vehicle companies. The fact Google had given them pots of money made things worse because team members had less financial incentive to stay instead they had cash to go off and form their own dream start-up. ¬† Search for: Recent Articles South Korea prosecutors expand charges against Samsung boss South Korea's special prosecutor's office has expanded charges against Samsung boss Jay Lee to inclu[...] Digital ‚ÄúGeneva Convention‚Äù is Smith‚Äôs dream Software king of the world Microsoft has called for a digital Geneva Convention which would see tech[...] India breaks record for most satellites launched at once India has successfully launched 104 satellites at once using its Isro's Polar Satellite Launch Vehic[...] Big Content Blames Canada Big content pressure groups the MPAA and RIAA have waded into Canada, claiming that it is a "safe ha[...] Harvard boffins invent decade lasting battery Harvard boffins have emerged from their smoke-filled rooms having invented a liquid battery which ca[...] ¬© 2017 TechEye.

Magic. Courtesy digitalspy Research confirms positive school climates improve grades Positive school climates contribute to academic achievement and can improve outcomes for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, according to a new study published today in Review of Educational Research, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Educational Research Association. In a comprehensive analysis of research published since 2000, U.S. and Israeli researchers found substantial evidence that schools with positive climates can narrow achievement gaps among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds and between students with stronger and weaker academic abilities. Broadly speaking, positive school climates are marked by a supportive, caring approach from teachers; a sense of safety from violence and bullying; student connectedness in school; and parental involvement. ‚ÄúOur findings suggest that by promoting a positive climate, schools can allow greater equality in educational opportunities, decrease socioeconomic inequalities, and enable more social mobility,‚Äù said study co-author Ron Avi Astor, a professor of social work and education at the University of Southern California.

That was the assumption behind BeyondCorp, a new model for network security that Google proposed back in 2014, and it‚Äôs one that‚Äôs starting to get some attention from networking and security vendors. Enterprises have moved beyond the traditional workspace in recent years, allowing employees to work remotely by using their personal devices and accessing apps in private or public clouds. To bring roaming workers back into the fold, under the security blanket of their local networks, companies rely on VPNs and endpoint software to enforce network access controls. Google's¬†BeyondCorp¬†approach to enterprise security takes the focus away from the network perimeter and puts it on devices and users. It doesn't assign higher or lower levels of trust to devices based on whether they're inside the internal network or not. Some security vendors have already started to embrace this no-trust-by-default security model. Duo Security, a two-factor authentication provider launched its own BeyondCorp-inspired offering last week, and enterprise software startup¬†ScaleFT has had dynamic access management service based on the same principles for a while. Even networking and security appliance manufacturers like Cisco Systems have begun moving what were traditionally perimeter security gateways into the cloud to better serve roaming employees. Duo Security's new Duo Beyond service consists of a software package that serves as an authentication gateway for all of a company's web-based applications, whether they're hosted inside the local network or in the cloud. It can be deployed in the company network's demilitarized zone (DMZ) and provides a single sign-on service that enforces device and user-based access policies. Duo Beyond assumes a zero-trust environment for all devices by default, regardless of whether they're connecting from within the enterprise network or from the outside. That said, it does provide administrators with the ability to differentiate between corporate devices and personal devices by deploying Duo certificates to those that are managed by the company. This device identification process has several benefits. It allows for the easy discovery of new devices that are used to access corporate applications, which helps companies create and maintain accurate inventories that include employees' personal devices. It also allows restricting access to certain applications or accounts to company-managed devices where a certain degree of security can be guaranteed. The service can also check the security state of a connecting device by looking at whether it's running the latest OS and browser version, whether the browser plug-ins are up to date and, in the case of mobile devices, whether encryption and passcode enforcement are turned on. This allows administrators to create fine-grained access rules based on device "health" and ensure that only reasonably secure devices can access company applications, even if those devices are owned and managed by the employees themselves. Duo Security doesn't expect customers to completely give up on VPNs if they deploy Duo Beyond, but based on the company's experience so far, customers can cut down VPN licensing costs by up to 80 percent. That's because most roaming employees only use VPN connections to access a few popular intranet web applications like Confluence, Jira or Sharepoint. The Duo Beyond service is priced at $9 per user per month and includes everything in the company's older Duo Access service, plus the new certificate-based device identification and the mechanism for controlling which internal apps are accessible by remote users. Moving towards a BeyondCorp security model, where the location of devices does not matter, can help companies avoid having to raise virtual walls inside their networks. Network segmentation, which relies on setting up firewalls and VLANs to restrict access to certain applications and services, is not easy to implement and can quickly become an administrative burden. In fact, as evidenced by many publicly documented security breaches, attackers often succeed in moving laterally inside a network once they break in. Most hackers start with targeting low-level employees through phishing or other methods and then, once inside a network, jump from system to system, exploiting vulnerabilities and stealing access credentials along the way until they reach the organization's crown jewels. Google's own network was breached in late 2009 as part of a cyberespionage campaign of Chinese origin known as Operation Aurora. The hackers, who started by targeting the company's employees, sought access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists. Other security vendors are embracing BeyondCorp too, and, while there are differences in the implementation, the general goal is the same: moving security beyond a strictly defined network perimeter. Duo Beyond works only for web-based applications and its device insight technology is agentless. The information about a laptop's OS, browser and plug-ins is obtained through the browser itself. This approach limits what kind of information can be gathered, but Duo believes that it strikes the right balance between security and usability, since convincing users to install company-mandated software on their personal devices can be problematic. By comparison, another company called ScaleFT provides a BeyondCorp-inspired solution called Dynamic Access Management that works for SSH (Secure Shell) and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), remote access protocols for Linux and Windows servers. ScaleFT's service does requires the installation of client software that synchronizes short-lived access certificates and handles device enrolment and local account creation. Pushed by the need to address the issue of roaming employees, BYOD and software-as-a-service, some networking vendors have even started to move security appliances outside the network perimeter and into the cloud. On Monday, Cisco Systems announced what it calls the first Secure Internet Gateway (SIG), which is based on the cloud-based OpenDNS Umbrella service that the company acquired in 2015. "A SIG provides safe access to the internet anywhere users go, even when they are off the VPN," Cisco said in a blog post. "Before you connect to any destination, a SIG acts as your secure onramp to the internet and provides the first line of defense and inspection. Regardless of where users are located or what they‚Äôre trying to connect to, traffic goes through the SIG first." If this new way of thinking of enterprise security catches on it might even help speed up the adoption of IPv6, which is held back partly by fears that it could punch holes through network perimeters and because many companies still have old firewalls and equipment that don't have proper support for it. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

We got a peek at where doodles come from. Tech Culture by Richard Nieva February 12, 2017 9:00 PM PST @richardjnieva How Google made a Doodle game For Valentine's Day, Google made a game where you play a rolling pangolin looking for love. This is how a team of artists, engineers and designers made one of Google's most complex Doodles to date. by Lexy Savvides 3:40 Close Drag Think of Valentine's Day, and the first thing that comes to mind probably isn't wildlife conservation. But that's one of the themes of Google's Valentine's Day doodle, which premiered on the search giant's homepage early Monday. It's one of the most in-depth Google Doodles the company has ever created and includes an interactive video game. It took about a year to develop and involved a six-person team of animators and engineers. The doodle stars two lovestruck pangolins, scaly mammals native to Asia and Africa that look like a cross between armadillos and anteaters. Google notes in the game that pangolins are the most poached and trafficked mammals in the world. The game also includes a link to a World Wildlife Fund page, which invites people to donate to protecting them. Google's Valentine's Day Doodle took almost a year to develop. Richard Nieva/CNET "If they're endangered, they really have to meet," Helene Leroux, the head artist for the doodle, said during an interview at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. "So it was a perfect theme for Valentine's Day." Step foot in the Google Doodle office and you might think you're at Pixar. A large blow-up version of Baymax, the health care robot from Disney's "Big Hero 6," greets you in the hallway. Desks are lined with Star Wars and Batman toys. There are tiny drawers full of sticker versions of past doodles. And most of the desks have Cintiqs, giant tablets artists use for digital drawings. The artwork that stands in for Google's logo has also become a big deal for the company. It's pretty obvious why: For lots of people, Google's search engine is the internet. It's the first place they go online, and that makes the homepage some of the choicest real estate on the web. The first doodle, in 1998, was a glorified "out of office" message -- a Burning Man stick figure that indicated co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were away at the annual festival. Now the Doodle team has 30 people, including animators, engineers and designers. Helene Leroux, head artist for the doodle, said the team chose its main characters from several different species that roll up into balls. John Kim/CNET But unlike animated movies and other creative projects, Google Doodles are fleeting. They go live on the homepage for a day, then are gone. (Actually, all the doodles are archived, but most people don't know that.) Doodles have also become a de facto avenue for the company to react to news. When Prince died last April, Doodlers scrambled to create a Purple Rain design in an hour to honor the singer, the fastest a doodle has ever been made. And on January 30, two days after President Donald Trump signed a controversial executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the Google Doodle celebrated the 98th birthday of Fred Korematsu, an activist who spoke out against the internment of Japanese Americans. Some saw it as a political statement. Google declined to comment on the Korematsu doodle -- or any potential political motivations -- beyond the blog post that originally accompanied the artwork. 48 Our favorite Google Doodles through the years The ecological bent in this year's Valentine's Day doodle was at first unintentional. It began as a design decision for the video game: find an animal that rolls. Runners-up included pill bugs and salamanders. The team originally settled on armadillos for the two main characters. But they wanted the game to feel more global, and worried armadillos might just invoke images of Texas and the Southwest. So the pangolin it was. The game is a side-scroller, like Super Mario brothers or Sonic the Hedgehog (in fact the game has striking similarities to Sonic, though the game's lead engineer said he's never played the Sega classic). In the game, available on iPhones, Android phones and desktop computers, you're a pangolin trying to woo your mate. You need to travel to four different countries, including Ghana and the Philippines, and collect various things to help you with your budding romance. In one level, for example, you collect flowers for a bouquet. In another, you gather music notes to write a song. They're like coins in Super Mario and rings in Sonic. So after almost a year of work, how does it feel for a doodle to finally premiere, and then vanish from the homepage a day later? "It's all this excitement, and then, nothing," said Jordan Thompson, head engineer for the doodle's video game, standing at his desk in the studio. A few feet away from him is a poster of a doodle inspired by artist Salvador Dali's painting "The Persistence of Memory," with two melting clocks standing in for the O's in Google. "It's both exciting and terrifying because you have to get it right," he added. "The first time." It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?

Google Squashed a Chrome Extension that Flooded Ad Networks With Disinformation For two years the AdNauseam extension helped desktop Chrome users obscure their ad profile‚Äîuntil Google disabled it last week. What happens when one of the giants of the modern internet decides that your product affects its business model? The debate came to the fore again last week when Google removed AdNauseam, an anti-tracking browser extension, from the Chrome Web Store. AdNauseam is built on the principles that Helen Nissenbaum, professor of Media, Culture and Communication and Computer Science at NYU and a co-creator of the extension, detailed in her book Obfuscation: in addition to hiding ads from the user, it also clicks every ad link in the background, creating a fog of fake data which confuses attempts to build a profile of the user's habits. Released in 2014, the extension was fully operational until the end of 2016, but according to AdNauseam has been unavailable for download from the Chrome Web Store since the start of 2017, with previously installed copies automatically deactivated in the Chrome browser. AdNauseam (picture here in Firefox) sends ad networks junk data by randomly "clicking" ads. Image: Screenshot/AdNauseam With Chrome accounting for 54 percent share of the desktop browser market as of late 2016, Google controls the channel through which the majority of global desktop internet users access the web, which is why its stance on users' right to opt out of tracking has such large implications. In a Skype call, Nissenbaum said: "What many people don't understand is that companies like Google and Apple‚Äîwho are really gatekeepers to an enormous amount of cultural and political activity‚Äîmay be reasonably benevolent at the moment... but because of how our system of regulation is set up, they still have complete freedom about who they decide to let on or kick off their respective platforms." In the desktop market, it should be noted that internet users do have a greater ability to move outside of the Google/Apple stack‚Äîbrowsers like Firefox or Brave also ad blocking and anti-tracking functionality‚Äîalthough where smartphones are concerned, it's harder to download software outside of the official app stores. As far as ad blockers go, tension with Google isn't new: in early 2013 the company removed several ad blocking apps from the Play Store for Android (Adblock Plus returned two years later in the form of a dedicated web browser). But where Chrome for the desktop is concerned, hugely popular extensions like AdBlock, Adblock Plus, and uBlock Origin (which AdNauseam is based upon) remain readily available, raising questions over why AdNauseam's tactics have left it specifically targeted for removal‚Äîa point which Google has been less than clear about. An email from the Web Store, forwarded by Nissenbaum to Motherboard, gives a stock response: Your item did not comply with the following section of our policy: An extension should have a single purpose that is clear to users. Do not create an extension that requires users to accept bundles of unrelated functionality, such as an email notifier and a news headline aggregator. Google did not reply to Motherboard's request for comment on the removal of AdNauseam. The real issue, many would argue, is a conflict of interest: Google wants to be responsive to the requests of its users by giving them the functionality they want‚Äîhere, a web browser with the ability to install a variety of extensions‚Äî, up until the point that these functions begin to impact its profit margin. And since developers don't have any specific right to have these products hosted on Google's platform, once the decision to block an app or extension is made it can be difficult to appeal. "Today it's your art/privacy tool, tomorrow it's your photo collection, or maybe your password manager," said AdNauseam's designer Mushon Zer-Aviv in an email. "Google should be frank about its policy, that browsing the web through Chrome is browsing the web under Google's corporate interest censorship." With Google yet to offer a response, the exact reason for AdNauseam's removal can't be confirmed. At present though, Chrome users can still run the AdNauseam extension by manually installing a zip file in developer mode, or switch to another browser instead. It remains to be seen whether Google will reverse the decision and reinstate it to the Web Store, but in the meantime, as the developers point out, it still works great in Firefox.

The Korea Times suggests the case focuses around a couple of agreements between Samsung and Google which introduced basic rules and service levels for devices running Android. Supposedly, the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement in 2011 saw both parties agree that a bunch of Google services would be pre-loaded on to devices running Andoid ‚Äì such as Chrome for the default browser, YouTube, Google Play and Gmail. Back in the day these bits of software would have been considered bloatware if they weren‚Äôt actually pretty good. Now, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) of Korea reckons Google is being a bit naughty again, even though this case and one other have been settled in recent years. The other case in question relates to an agreement known as the Anti-Fragmentation Agreement (AFA), in which both Google and Samsung agreed that the latter is prohibited from creating a proprietary operating system of its own by using code belonging to the former. An FTC official has said it is reopening investigations into AFA, suggesting that it is impeding Samsung‚Äôs development of its own OS. Now, it‚Äôs not for us to say that there might be a little bit of compatriot protection going on from the Korean FTC; but it wouldn‚Äôt at all be surprising if it is looking for ways in which to give Samsung more of a hand against the Californian juggernaut. Samsung has made no secret of its desire to push forward with Tizen, its proprietary OS, and has done so on its TVs and wearable range. But given that a significant percentage of Android‚Äôs install base comes from Samsung devices, it makes total sense that Google wants to protect that. On the face of things, it looks like Samsung and Google both willingly entered negotiations and commonly agreed upon a framework which prevents the consumer electronics giant from eating up Google market share with some form of Android rip off. Tizen is merely a manifestation of Samsung‚Äôs desperation to differentiate its smartphones from the rest of the Android crowd in a more significant way than mere brute marketing spend. The Note7 battery disaster was a consequence of this desperation and now it seems to have found an ally in its domestic trade regulators. The desired outcome for Samsung, presumably, would be a greater capacity to customise the user experience of its Android devices and supercede Google services with its own. You‚Äôd think it would be relatively open/shut, especially as the case has already been closed once before in Google‚Äôs favour. But in the crazy, crazy world of international technology regulation, who knows what could possibly happen next? When will autonomous vehicles hit the road? 2018 2019 2020 2021 Not before 2022 ¬†Loading ...

That transition seems to have happened without much drama, with Patrick Spence taking over a company he‚Äôd already been with for some time. But there is plenty of drama in the wireless speaker space where Sonos lives. The very idea of a ‚Äúwireless speaker‚Äù has changed from just being a thing you use to play music and become a voice-controlled tube with artificial intelligence inside of it. To be fair, it‚Äôs not that the Amazon Echo, Google Home, and whatever Apple and Microsoft are cooking up are all direct competition for Sonos. Sonos is still firmly at the high end of the speaker market, appealing in large part to audiophiles who like their hi-fi speakers. But all of those other speakers could be giving people less reason to buy a Play:1 or some other Sonos device. When Spence took over, he sent out a memo to his employees that faced that new reality in a relatively clear-eyed way about the challenges Sonos faces from those assistant-style speakers. He noted that Sonos needs to have a ‚Äúbias to action,‚Äù which is executive speak for ‚Äúreleasing products more quickly.‚Äù A couple weeks ago, when Spence was making the press rounds in San Francisco, we sat down with him for a candid discussion about Sonos‚Äô future. He hinted pretty strongly that his company would finally think about making an ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù speaker and explained why he thought Sonos would be able to become the Switzerland of wireless speakers ‚Äî a place where Siri and Alexa and Google can all coexist. (Or perhaps a better metaphor would be Rick‚Äôs Cafe in Casablanca.) We‚Äôre still a little dubious that all of Sonos‚Äô partners will let that happen, but Spence believes Sonos‚Äô track record in working with competing music services is as an indicator that he can pull it off. Of course, between now and then Sonos needs to get better microphones in (or attached to) its products. And as for people buying Echoes instead of Sonos speakers? Spence‚Äôs hope is that they‚Äôll step up to Sonos eventually. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. It seems like Sonos lives at the high end of home audio, and then Alexa came in and is just doing home assistance stuff and people are just buying that speaker because the sound is good enough. And now that's what they're filling their home with because they're cheaper. Do you feel like Sonos wants to stay at the high end of home audio, or do you feel like you need to move into the low end? I think the good thing about what Amazon and Google have done is get more people interested in [home audio]. I think that a Play:1 is $199. I really believe that if we do this right, that there'll be a lot of people that we target that'll want to step up to something like a Play:1, for instance, as part of it. Definitely things like sound quality continue to be really important to what we do. I think that reliability and quality of the Sonos experience ... People know it's rock solid. That's what we want to stick to. Make sure we have that really quality experience. Then [you think about supporting multiple] services, which I think are really important for people. As you think about the home, it's just different. You know my kids use Spotify, I use Apple Music, I use Google Play Music, my wife uses Pandora. You need something that can support all of those. I think that's where not everybody's going to use Alexa. Not everybody's going to use Google Assistant. I may use one, my wife may use another. That's where we're in a unique position in the industry as opposed to this notion of like high end or low end or anything like that. What was your first impression of Alexa? I was immediately saying, "This is important as a technology.‚Äù In terms of creating something we've always talked about, which is ‚Äútime to music.‚Äù How quickly can you get that music playing? As I watched my own kids start to use that and say, "I'm not going to go get the iPad or an iPod to be able to do it." I saw it and I said, "We really need to get on this bandwagon. How are we going to be able to make it faster to get to your music and get it playing?" Now it's not great for discovery. It's not great for going deeper and building a playlist, [which are] a bunch of things that you need. So it's a complementary thing to having an app or another experience. Was your first thought, ‚ÄúWe're going to try to build this type of feature set ourselves,‚Äù then? Or did you start talking to Amazon right away? We started engaging with Amazon right away because ‚Äî I mean ‚Äî you know our history. We didn't try to create a music service. We know there's people out there that do a really good job of that. You see it with Spotify, you see it with Apple, you see it with follow players. We knew people would be putting billions into these assistants. It's much better, in my opinion, if we are partnering with some of the players out there. I think it's been really interesting to watch. ‚ÄúWe started engaging with Amazon right away.‚Äù You know Amazon, right from the get-go, has been really open about engaging on it. We found a really good partnership there. I'd say with Google, it was interesting at the beginning to see like how much was it going to be a push of home versus the Google Assistant. I think even they, as they've started to get into this, really said, "Okay, let's open this up and try to get our Assistant on as many devices as possible." So if you knew right away you wanted Alexa on Sonos, can you tell us why it hasn‚Äôt come out yet? What‚Äôs taking so long? We're doing it a little differently in terms of the way we approach it. Of course, we could have done it [on a different scale] and been off and running that way. But you know we think broader about the experience and what's possible. We're actually doing some work with them which is unique around the music experience that we're creating. We believe that it's worth investing that time and energy to create something a little bit more unique. Others will be able to use whatever we're working with Amazon on, and they'll be able to build on that. I think it's really important we get that experience right, and that we are thinking about how we support a world where there are multiple voice services, too. We didn't want to end up in a situation where we're only supporting one. You know, for instance, at CES, a lot of those devices are dedicated to one voice service. It would be like a speaker that could only do Spotify. How useful is that really in the home context? We want to make sure that customers have an opportunity to use any of the voice services that are out there. Do you really think it's likely that Sonos will be able to be agnostic in the coming battle of who's going to be the main assistant in homes? We're already seeing Google and Amazon starting to fight. Maybe Apple will come in someday. All of these companies are deeply incentivized to try and get their partners to sign deals that are exclusive. Do you really think that a player as big in home audio as Sonos is going to be able to work with all those services at once? I think we have a great track record on this. I totally understand the question, but I think we have a great track record on this through music services. Apple Music being on Sonos, I think, was a surprise to a lot of people, [and then we added] Spotify, Google Play Music. I think we sit in a unique position where we have an amazing set of customers and we've been able to actually kind of put that first. Look, if you're Amazon, you know you need to be on as many devices as possible to get the orders, right? As you think about what the prime motivation is. For Google, if you're not on every device so that you can be for the search opportunity, that's a huge miss. If you think about the people that have Sonos today, that's why it was interesting to Apple Music, that's why I believe it's interesting to every voice service that's out there. Do you think that every Sonos speaker in the future needs to have good far-field microphones so it can itself act as an assistant? Absolutely. When will Sonos devices come with far-field microphones? Stay tuned. ‚ÄúIf I want to ask Google a question and my wife wants to ask Alexa a question, we should be able to do that.‚Äù Will I set up my Sonos and part of the setup process is, "Which assistant would you like to use," and then the microphones will listen for just that assistant? I actually see it a little bit differently because we should be able to, in the same way you can set up multiple voice services today, [you] should be able to do that [with assistants]. Again, I wouldn't want to lock a home into one particular one. If I want to ask Google a question and my wife wants to ask Alexa a question, we should be able to do that. That's what we want to pull off. Are you going to work with Amazon to make that experience better with the Dot connected to Sonos? That is really what we shared back in September, [which was that] the first phase of the experience will be an ability to control your Sonos from your Dot or Echo. That's kind of job one as we go through this and obviously you can tell where we go to job two. We would love to do the same thing with Google Home. Fundamentally, there‚Äôs a tension for Sonos that‚Äôs not entirely unlike what you faced when you were at BlackBerry: disruption from a place you didn‚Äôt expect. You‚Äôre busy making high-end speakers, but maybe people care less about quality and are willing to just buy a ton of cheap Echos or Google Homes. How do you strategically make sure that you don't get hit from left field? Absolutely. I am paranoid about disruption and particularly so because of my time at BlackBerry. That's why as quickly as I could I got an Echo. I go through these things. I try to use them as much as possible. As we think about that future, a couple things are happening. One is that music streaming services are exploding and we continue to innovate and do things like allow you to play from the app like we've done with Spotify. And you'll see a lot more of that. We're going to continue to evolve our own app. ‚ÄúI'm not sure that they're going to throw a $50 Dot in every room.‚Äù In the home, there are multiple rooms and multiple kind of use cases ‚Äî around, for instance, the television or other screens. There's the outdoor room, there's the bedroom, the bathroom. There are different uses that are there that I think get underestimated. So as people think about the design of their home, and they think about what they want to put in their home, I'm not sure that they're going to throw a $50 Dot in every room ‚Äî particularly if they love music ‚Äî and that's who we're going after. I don't think it's as simple as smartphones, [where] the people would buy into a particular ecosystem and then lock in and everything around that. I think the home and the number of people in a home make it a complex kind of situation, which I think we can take advantage of. We have a proven track record of supporting multiple services from competing vendors. Certainly I'm sure there are people that have purchased a Google Home or an Echo instead of a Play:1, but I don't look at that [and think] they're dead to Sonos. There's an opportunity to get into their living room and get into other rooms in their home with some of the interoperability work we're doing. What's an ideal sort of end game for you at Sonos? Does Sonos want to be its own giant, public technology company? Does Sonos see itself partnering in more serious ways in the future? What happens if another company offers to buy Sonos? The good news is we're profitable, so we have some leeway with this, which I think puts us in a unique position. We'll see how it evolves over time. Right now, certainly, we're pretty clear in terms of what our mission is. To fill every home with music. We can see that we are able to do that. We've built something unique. We're also not here in the Bay Area. We're in Santa Barbara and Boston and spread throughout the world. We do things a little differently. You may have seen we've done these private rounds as we go through which gives employees an opportunity for liquidity. We're fully diluted. We are an employee-owned company, as well. We do things a little differently and I think we have options. We're not in any rush to do anything, but our ultimate objective is to fill as many homes with music as possible. I see us being an independent company doing that. Do you think if you were to grow in a significant way you would have to branch out into other products? Non-speaker products for the home? No, I don't see that yet. I think there's a lot of opportunity ahead. Obviously, I'll be looking at what other things are out there, what do we need to do. But no, I don't foresee that being necessary for us to become a multi-billion dollar company. What about different kinds of speakers? Sonos has resisted the temptation to put out just a Bluetooth speaker. Are you going to continue to resist that temptation? ‚ÄúThere's the outdoor room we haven't addressed.‚Äù I think the Bluetooth speakers are the ones that have been hardest hit by the introduction of things like the Echo and the Home. Certainly we're looking at like the different use cases for our products. I feel like we have so much room to run still in the home. There's the outdoor room we haven't addressed. There's a whole bunch of interesting ideas we have around TV sound, there's a whole bunch of great ideas for the home. I think we've got a lot of room to run there. We'll continue to look at it and evaluate it but yeah. I think we've got a lot more to do in the home. Has anyone offered to buy Sonos? No. Do you think you need to be involved more in the Smart Home ecosystem? Do you want to talk to my Smart light bulb? Do you want to talk to my Smart thermostat? Or do you feel like Sonos is better thought of as one of the satellites in an Internet of Things home and not the hub? I think anytime people get focused on that hub, it seems to become kind of overwhelming, and then they get into these weird battles of different standards. Let's spend the rest of our time arguing about Z-Wave vs. Zigbee. I think that would be great. Yeah! So for us, I think part of it is we get some benefits with working with the likes of Amazon and Google ‚Äî where they're actually tying in and allowing that. We'll leave it to some of the companies that are working on those types of interoperability and we should be able to ride the wave of those, I hope. That's not an area I feel we can differentiate or should focus on. You know, I'm sorry. I'm still hung up on this idea that you're going to be able to play nice with Google and Amazon and Apple... I get it. What's your strategy for pulling that off? Do you have leverage because of your install base of customers? I think if you rewind a bit, if you sat there 10 years ago and said, ‚ÄúYou're going to get every competing music service on a platform,‚Äù You would've thought ‚ÄúThat's crazy, there's no way.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe stay very focused on what we're good at and then we'll partner for the rest of it.‚Äù I think today we're in a much better position [today] in terms of the homes that we're in. With Apple and the Apple Music side, certainly it [helped] that we're in all musician's homes and they said, "Listen, I'd love to try Apple Music but it'll need to be on Sonos." I think if you are trying to sell something, [or] you're the biggest retail engine that's out there, or if you're the biggest search engine that's out there, you're motivated to get into the kind of homes that Sonos is in. I also think we approach it in a pretty open way. We also, unlike a lot of companies, we're not going to go try to compete then and extend into search or extend into retail or do some of the things that other companies will do. We stay very focused on what we're good at and then we'll partner for the rest of it. I think that does put us in a unique position and we've got a track record of doing it.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Internet Google to ban torrent sites Internet Google to ban torrent sites By Bindu Nair - Feb 14, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Google is reportedly stepping up its tactics when it comes to scrubbing out the appearance of torrent websites from its search results. It might be joined by a number of other search engines such as Yahoo or Bing. The entertainment industry has blamed Google and its ilk in the past of not being active enough in the fight against piracy. The search giant apparently got a billion takedown requests last year. Still, it‚Äôs easy enough to find torrent sites like The Pirate Bay or Kickass Torrents right now on the first page itself. Word is that countries like the UK are thinking of introducing legislation to put a stop to this. Rather than being forced to comply with a law, Google and entertainment industry representatives are choosing to go with a voluntary agreement instead. After being part of roundtable discussions with the UK‚Äôs Intellectual Property Office, all the parties involved are supposedly going to enforce this code starting from 1 June 2017. Also See: Google app gets offline search feature The meetings appear to be held in secret since they aren‚Äôt being spoken about in public. TorrentFreak quotes UK politician Baroness Buscombe as stating that key contents of the code have been finalized and an agreement will probably take place very soon. She also went on to praise the search engines involved, stating that they have been making changes to their algorithms and working with the entertainment industry to explore options. It‚Äôs not immediately clear what effect the code will have after it‚Äôs been enforced since concrete details about it aren‚Äôt being disclosed as of now. In any case, clearing search results of torrent sites may or may not have a significant impact on piracy since people usually find a way around such hiccups. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if the rumored code spreads beyond UK shores to other countries such as the US or India, with the latter currently trying its own methods to clamp down on illegal downloads.

Unlike previously-hyped hardware such as Google Glass, Echo made a surprisingly quick entry to the market and has seen strong sales. The chart below from Business Insider shows estimated worldwide unit sales of 2.4m in 2015 and more than double that in 2016. What makes Alexa so interesting to me is not just the confluence of science fiction and reality, but the uncertainty about just how far this technology will be admitted into our lives. Most coverage of Alexa and most anecdotal user feedback (from my friends who have splashed out) suggests that the Echo is used for relatively limited functionality - chiefly, productivity and entertainment. A survey conducted by Statista (see below) showed playing music and controlling smart lights to be the most frequently used functionality. Being able to check and update your shopping list or calendar, play music, search Google - none of this is inconsequential, of course. For many, these features alone are enough to justify investing in an Echo. But the survey results beg the question - how will functionality evolve and should brands be getting in on the act? The research was conducted at a relatively early stage for Echo (Alexa Skills increased in number by c.4000 between May and December 2016), and the sample size of the survey wasn't great either. Are Echo owners now ready for some more varied functionality? Of the integrations now available in early 2017 there are some that conceptually seem like a good fit. Uber and Domino's for example. Whilst there may be the odd bit of friction involved, partly due to functionality being tied to one default destination or pizza order, these are surely just wrinkles. However, for every one of these promising Skills there are others that have been met with derision by Echo owners. A problem of concept or execution? The growth in Skills developed by third-party developers is impressive, but look at the number of critical reviews. In the screenshot below I have broken out Amazon's cumulative frequencies to show the number of reviews left at each star rating. More than a third of reviews are one or two star reviews. Okay, some of these reviews are probably spurious. And not all Skills will work - just as not every mobile app works.¬† However, some of the bigger-brand forays into Alexa Skills (outside of news, entertainment and connected home) do seem patchy at this early stage. Almost 60% of 63 reviews for BMW's Alexa Skill are rated one star only. The functionality is limited and is not integrated with all of BMW's new models. How's this for a review: A brand new, $80k+ M4 Coupe and all I can do so far is have Alexa lock my doors, although I can't check whether they're already locked or not. "Alexa, ask BMW if my doors are locked." Reply: "This feature is not supported for your vehicle."; Not Alexa's fault though, BMW apparently hasn't made their end smart enough yet. To be fair to BMW, they responded, detailing what functionality this customer can try out (check trip details and turn on ventilation), and thanking them for being an early adopter. Even so, could this early release annoy valuable customers in a sector where tech is a big selling point? In the UK, National Rail's Alexa Skill has critical reviews pointing out poor UX, such as having to keep saying "more" to get Alexa to name every train time, or having to specify an exact railway station, when users often want to name a city. It is perhaps the perfect example of an experience more suited to a screen than a voice. Some of the Skills available are seemingly scuppered by poor implementation. But some of them are poor concepts, too. Until Amazon adds that¬†rumoured screen to Echo, brands should think carefully whether their Alexa Skill will be a delightful experiment for high value customers or a frustrating waste of time. Getting involved early isn't necessarily a bad thing if brands are equipped to fail fast. However, if Skills are not updated regularly enough, they risk achieving the opposite of what is intended and giving users a poor and all-too memorable experience on their shiny new speaker. Early app developers arguably had a greater period of grace, as the world began to understand the power of smartphones. If Echo devices¬†continue to fly off the shelves, I'm not sure Skill developers can sail as close to the wind. Further reading: Should financial services brands follow Capital One on to Amazon Echo?

Interesting points and at this stage, I think Amazon Echo is simply a bridge to connect some of the services we would like to have integrated through smartphones, but in voice form. However, I believe that it essential that marketers start to consider what happens when screens are no longer the primary method of engagement / content consumption. Your blog last week said that a significant % of google searches on mobile are now voice searches, but what happens when those searches take place in environments where the output is voice and not a screen? So, I agree totally that Echo / Alexa requires a careful approach, but if voices becomes the new "screen", marketers should be considering what that world could look like for their business - sooner rather than later. about 20 hours ago Comment

The project took years to pull off and required 16,000 computer processors to analyze 10 million images. That type of AI, known as deep learning, now powers Amazon.com‚Äôs smart speaker Echo and Tesla‚Äôs self-driving cars. While such software can seem magical, it still typically requires thousands of computers to spend months scanning millions of data points. Ben Vigoda, an MIT-trained computer scientist (and nephew of late actor Abe Vigoda), says he can cut out most of the grunt work and make AI projects doable for businesses without Google-level resources. His company, Gamalon Machine Intelligence, uses probability models to teach a computer to ID something like a cat in a few minutes by showing it just a few images. ‚ÄúYou can run our software on a laptop, and it takes 100 times less horsepower to find an answer,‚Äù says Vigoda, who started Gamalon in 2013 but is showing its products to the public for the first time. A typical deep-learning system needs to see tons of cats to learn all their variations‚Äîcats with every length of legs, tails, whiskers, and so on. Gamalon‚Äôs system gets a head start on this process with a new form of what‚Äôs known as probabilistic programming. Shown a cat with a long tail and one with a short tail, it can fill in the gaps. ‚ÄúThe promise here is that you use data a lot more efficiently,‚Äù says Brenden Lake, a data science fellow at New York University. Vigoda‚Äôs previous business, Lyric Semiconductor, hard-wired probability functions into computer chips. Lyric‚Äôs tech has found its way into Echo and cars, where it helps guess what people are saying, and into smartphones, where it improves the results of touches and swipes. With $4.5 million in funding from Silicon Valley investors and backing from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon‚Äôs research and development arm, the Gamalon team has spent the past few years advancing probability technology to broaden its usefulness. Academics have been working on probability-based AI systems for more than a decade, but few have made it to the real world. Microsoft‚Äôs TrueSkill, which ranks Xbox gamers, uses similar technology, as does pioneering startup Geometric Intelligence, acquired last year by Uber. Such systems have been tough to expand beyond very specific uses because humans still have to do the complex, time-consuming math to adjust their probability models. Gamalon‚Äôs big claim is that its software can adjust its own models, essentially reprogramming itself. While Vigoda says his technology can be applied broadly, his company has started by focusing on a niche. Its first products, called Structure and Match, are designed to scour common databases and fix ambiguities, like different spellings for customer names and addresses. Communications-hardware maker Avaya, one of Gamalon‚Äôs handful of early customers, has been using the software‚Äîwhich costs $10,000 a month for analysis of each 100,000 rows of text in a database‚Äîfor this kind of task. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Thousands of companies resell Avaya‚Äôs products and record customer data in different ways. To keep its databases effectively searchable, Avaya used to use people to pore through them for months at a time, turning ‚ÄúSt.‚Äù into ‚ÄúStreet‚Äù or ‚ÄúHP‚Äù into ‚ÄúHewlett-Packard.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith Gamalon, we were able to match 85 percent of the data in minutes instead of days,‚Äù says senior director Cary Gumbert. Unlike find-and-replace search tools, the software can recognize context, so it doesn‚Äôt turn, say, the ‚ÄúSt.‚Äù in ‚ÄúSt. Louis‚Äù into ‚ÄúStreet.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf we train it more and tell it where it has missed something,‚Äù Gumbert says, ‚Äúit will only get better.‚Äù The bottom line: Gamalon says it can cut AI training requirements from millions of photos and thousands of computers down to a few of each.

This is a detailed comparison of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow vs Android 7 Nougat on the Nexus 6P. Advertisement Here we will detail some of the new features and changes Google has made in Android Nougat, 7.1 and now the Android 7.1.2 Nougat release.¬†There are over 50 changes, but only a few are visual. Many¬†of the improvements¬†are behind the scenes but will¬†make a big difference as¬†it arrives for Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola and many other phones. Read: How to Fix Bad Nexus Android Nougat¬†Battery Life Google‚Äôs Android 6.0 Marshmallow update was released in October 2015 after a long beta period, and Android 7.0 Nougat was released on August 22nd. It adds multiple impressive features and improves on the overall design. Additionally, Android 7.1.1 was released on December 5th, followed by a beta of 7.1.2 in January.¬†As 2017 continues more and more manufacturers have started to release updates. Android 7.0 Nougat first debuted back¬†on March 9th.¬†Earlier than prior years in an effort to get it into users hands as fast as possible. As a result the company received more feedback, made additional changes,¬†and were better prepared for future updates thanks to the beta period. Advertisement After months of fine-tuning the developer preview (beta) was released as a stable software update for all Nexus devices.¬†Manufacturers are still busy¬†developing the latest software. However, the LG G5 is getting Android 7.0 right now. Moto Z & G users have the latest release, HTC is doing the same, and Samsung is slowly getting around to it.¬†Samsung‚Äôs Nougat beta recently ended, and we‚Äôre expecting most US carriers to update in February. Read: Android 6.0 vs Android 5.1 Lollipop: What‚Äôs New in Marshmallow As promised, Google offered¬†multiple ‚Äúmaintenance releases‚Äù or previews of Android Nougat before it was released. Now,¬†it‚Äôs a fully featured and stable release that will eventually arrive for all compatible Android devices. The beta versions are now 7.1.2 for select devices. Now that many Nexus and Pixel phones are on Android 7.1.1, others are up next. Expect¬†carriers and manufacturers¬†to continue working hard on updates¬†as 2017 continues. Then, we‚Äôll start getting Android 7.0 or Android 7.1.1 on all other phones. Advertisement Android 7.0 or Android 7.1 Nougat is a free software update for all smartphones and tablets that can support it. Many¬†will get updates from manufacturers like Samsung, Motorola, LG and more. That said, it took most phones and tablets a long time to get Android 6.0 Marshmallow. We‚Äôre hoping N rolls out faster around the globe.¬†Android 7.1.2 Nougat isn‚Äôt set to be released for a few months, and by then most should at least be on any of the versions of Nougat that are available. What‚Äôs New in Android¬†Nougat Currently the Android 7.1.2 Nougat release is only available for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player and the Pixel C tablet. As well as the Pixel phones. Three missing from that list are: the Nexus 5, Nexus 7 (2013) and the Nexus 10. We‚Äôve recently learned the Nexus 5 won‚Äôt officially get the update to Android 7.0 at all. At least not from Google. Then, the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 received 7.1.1 but won‚Äôt get 7.1.2 Nougat. Additionally, Android¬†7.1 is available on the Google Pixel, Nexus 5x, Nexus 6P and Pixel C. Other devices on Nougat are running Android 7.0 and not Google‚Äôs latest maintenance update. Some of the most noteworthy new features are split-screen multitasking and multi-window mode. This works great and supports all apps, not just select few like we see on Samsung or LG devices. Another huge addition to N is Android Instant Apps. This¬†will enable Android to install small bits of an app (say, from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. No installing an app and starting over. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, uses the app, and you‚Äôre done. It discards it once finished. Other changes include improved battery life again with a more efficient ‚ÄúDoze‚Äù on-the-go mode, seamless updates that happen behind the scenes (if enabled), a completely revamped notifications and settings menu that‚Äôs smarter, more detailed and enhanced. We also like the new round icons, space saver, and app icon shortcuts. Not to mention direct reply from notification bar for all apps, bunched notifications for a cleaner look, number blocking and call screening, improved Quick Setting tiles (and customization) and more. Meaning, there is a lot to see. We‚Äôll be adding more to our list as we dig through each release. Comparison You can click on any of the images below to instantly jump to that image in the slideshow and see how that part of the OS compares to previous versions. It‚Äôs worth noting the older Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow will always be on the left if needed.¬†Android 7.0 Nougat or 7.1.1 is on the right or by itself. We‚Äôll update with more details as they become available. Multi-window Support ¬† 1 / 27 With Android N Google has finally delivered multi-window support. Essentially allowing two apps to run on the screen simultaneously. This works on both tablets and smartphones, and appears to work across all apps. We saw this in Android M previews, but it never made it to the final version. However, in Android N this is a highlight feature that's getting a lot of attention. Multi-window support works by tapping the square recent apps menu, then sliding any app to the top. Instantly users can run two apps at once, resize each screen as they see fit, and better multi-task on Android. This will be a very welcomed edition for Android tablet users, app developers and more. Google also states this will allow "Picture-in-Picture" mode for Android TV, which is awesome. Being able to watch TV while browse Netflix at the same time. ¬† 1 / 27 18 Responses 03/10/2016 Angelatphoenix Reply Cool inonce‚Ä¶!m¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠y f¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠r¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠i¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠e¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠n¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠d‚Äôs s¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠t¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠e¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠p-s¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠i¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠s¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠t¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠e¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠r m¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠a¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠k¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠e¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠s $85 /h¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠r o¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠n t¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠he co¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠mpu¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠ter .

In fact, entertainment industry bodies at various times have even accused Google of fueling it and profiting from it. Reports said on Monday that Google, Yahoo and Bing executives met representatives of the entertainment industry in the UK facilitated by the British Intellectual Property office and that the search giants are close to signing a deal to ban torrent aggregators. The move intends to ensure that access to pirated content is cut-off at the search level itself. For example, a consumer searching for ‚ÄòDownload movie XYZ‚Äô will no longer be directed to torrent sites from where the pirated copy of said movie can be accessed. While the move may prevent some people from accessing pirated content, savvy users will easily be able to circumvent it. Here are five ways how the torrent sites will still be accessible to users: Through other search engines Most pirates are likely to move from the traditional search engines like Google and Bing to privacy-focussed ones like DuckDuckGo and Ixquick. Sites such as DuckDuckGo emphasize on protecting searchers‚Äô privacy and avoiding the filtered search results. This means no website, including torrent sites, will be filtered out from search results. Directly accessing torrent sites Popular torrents sites maintain their own internal search engine for pirated content. Users can go around the ban by simply visiting popular torrent sites directly and searching for the content they need. The most popular public torrent platforms offer very sophisticated search engines that allow users to filter results by popularity. Private trackers While public torrent trackers (platforms) are popular with most users, private trackers offer a significant upgrade. They‚Äôre called ‚Äúprivate‚Äù because they regulate who is allowed to use the site or in other words they are an exclusive community. Because the rules are so strict and the sites are so much less visited than sites such as The Pirate Bay, users are a lot less likely to have someone looking over their shoulder. So, the search engine ban hammer is unlikely to affect access to these sites because of their relative obscurity. Illegal streaming sites Torrenting is so 2003 and illegal streaming sites are the new king, at least that is what the data says. A large majority of traffic for both TV and film piracy is now being hogged by streaming piracy sites instead of torrent-based downloading, with roughly 58 billion visits last year alone according to research group Muso. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a clear piracy audience trend change away from content ‚Äòownership‚Äô using P2P/Torrents or web downloads,‚Äù the company reported. Just how large is that? According to Muso, streaming volume accounts for approximately 74% of all TV and movie piracy online, with traffic to torrent sites dropping sharply. tags Torrents blocked Google Yahoo Bing Online piracy more from tech WhatsApp to soon roll out Snapchat like Stories feature in iOS Feb 15, 2017 11:53 IST Back from the dead: Nokia 3310 set to make a comeback, say reports Feb 15, 2017 11:52 IST A Guide to Teaching Your Kids About Money Partnered feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright ¬© HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

(3) 0 165950 In September of 2016, Google announced the launch of the Neural Machine Translation system. The technology was meant to improve the accuracy of automated translations. But things went far beyond the tech giant‚Äôs plan, as self-learning computers invented their own modus operandi. / When you type a sentence in¬†Dutch in¬†Google Translate to¬†get its English translation, you‚Äôd normally expect the system to¬†look up¬†each word in¬†some sort of¬†big dictionary. But that‚Äôs not exactly the way it works. Thanks to¬†the use of¬†the so-called statistical approach, Google‚Äôs AI looks at¬†the sentence as¬†a whole. Then it picks groups of¬†words and attempts to¬†build a translated phrase according to¬†certain rules ‚Äì rules acquired through¬†machine learning and user input. That way you get a result which is compared against¬†proper phrases used by¬†actual people on¬†the Internet. To improve accuracy even more Google has been routinely ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù its supercomputers with¬†gigabytes of¬†documents from¬†the United Nations website, which has mirror archives in¬†six different languages. In a Youtube video Eric Schmidt, who served as¬†Google‚Äôs CEO for¬†ten years, said that Google Translate went through¬†massive improvements thanks to¬†the use of¬†neural networks: If you look at¬†the error rate of¬†Google Translate, which all of¬†you use, we had an error rate of¬†roughly 23%, we were able to¬†reduce it to¬†8% using the latest in¬†neural networks. Artificial neural networks are a method of¬†computing where artificial neurons loosely imitate the human brain. There are neural networks with¬†thousands, or even million neural units. The method is widely used in¬†technologies such as¬†speech recognition and image analysis. But machine translation remains a difficult task for¬†computers due to¬†the complexity of¬†human languages. However, with¬†the introduction of¬†Neural Machine technology, besides¬†the reduced translation error rates, Google engineers noticed something unexpected. All by¬†themselves the computers learned to¬†translate between¬†various pairs of¬†languages, like¬†Korean and Japanese, without¬†the use of¬†English as¬†a bridge. It means that AI invented its own internal bridge language, which is hard for¬†humans to¬†understand. Surprisingly, the Neural Machine did not just look up¬†corresponding words in¬†English-Japanese and English-Korean dictionaries. Instead, the network compared phrase patterns, words and meanings in¬†Japanese and Korean, and then successfully matched corresponding concepts. Google is not the only company in¬†the market which is actively researching and implementing machine learning and neural networks. Giants like¬†Facebook and Microsoft are also developing their own automated speech, image recognition and machine translation services. So, perhaps, besides¬†Google‚Äôs ‚Äúinterlingua‚Äù, we may very well see other examples of¬†computers outsmarting their creators and speaking their own language.

Vishal Mathur With Android Wear 2.0, you will be able to download apps directly on to the watch from the new Play Store that will be available on the wrist. The smartwatch ecosystem needed Google to step up its game with the Android Wear smartwatch operating system. Ever since Wear was launched in 2014, it has been plagued by issues such as poor battery life. Android Wear smartwatches from the likes of Motorola, Huawei and Asus, for example, struggled because of the clunky software that was not very intuitive. Google is now rolling out its biggest update for the Wear platform in years, a definitive move perhaps at creating a space for itself in the smartwatch ecosystem. Called Android Wear 2.0, it started rolling out this week. Watch gets its own apps¬† With Android Wear 2.0, you will be able to download apps directly on to the watch from the new Play Store that will be available on the wrist. Whether you use an Android phone or are using the watch with an Apple iPhone, apps built for Android Wear 2.0 will work on the watch itself. These will include AccuWeather, Google Fit, Google Messenger, Google Play Music, Runkeeper, Telegram and Uber. Additionally, if your watch has a built-in cellular (3G/4G) connection, you will be able to use watch apps (and make calls, for example), irrespective of where your phone might be at the time.¬† Time for the Assistant‚Äôs magic The Assistant was exclusive so far to Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. With the new Wear software, the artificial intelligence feature will also be available on the watch. You will be able to speak with it and get responses for queries as well as suggestions. Ask your Google Assistant about the weather, make restaurant reservations or simply share some content with friends. Initially, Google Assistant will be available in English and German on Android Wear watches, with more languages being added in the coming months. The Assistant also helps with a new feature called Smart Replies. It will suggest reply options based on the message your friend has just sent you.¬† Watch faces with relevant information The refreshed watch faces will now pack in more information. Among the various options you‚Äôll be able to select from, there will be data overlays for information such as calendar appointments, fitness goals and progress, favourite contacts, etc. As a user, you will be able to personalize this completely for your requirements and preferences. You will also be able to set different watch faces for different times of the day. For example, you might prefer the fitness statistics during your morning jogging routine. Once done, swipe and switch to another watch face that is more tuned for the day in office. In the evening, switch to a more casual one as you head out for dinner with friends.¬† We do expect the new Wear software to be better optimized in terms of battery life‚Äîthis has been one of the persistent problems with Android Wear watches, and allowed hybrid smartwatches to gain ground as users looked for a balance between smart features and convenience.¬† Does your existing watch get the update? If you have an Android Wear watch that is no more than 18 months old, chances are you should see the update pop up on the watch sometime over the next few days. Some of the existing watches that are confirmed for Wear 2.0 include the Asus ZenWatch 2 and ZenWatch 3, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, Casio PRO TREK Smart, Fossil Q Founder, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Wander, Huawei Watch, LG G Watch R, LG Watch Urbane and 2nd Edition LTE, Michael Kors Access Smartwatches, Moto 360 (2nd Gen), Moto 360 for Women, Moto 360 Sport, New Balance RunIQ, Nixon Mission, Polar M600 and TAG Heuer Connected. The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style will be the latest watches to run Android Wear 2.0, and should be hitting the markets in some countries soon, though there is no word yet on their availability in India.

How To Make The Most Of Valentine‚Äôs Day With Android For Couples Google‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day Doodle Is Actually A Game February 14, 2017 - Written By Daniel Golightly The Google Doodle for Valentine‚Äôs day is up and if you haven‚Äôt seen it already, it‚Äôs also a nicely designed 2D platformer game featuring a pangolin in love and chocolate cake. As is usually the case, this Doodle serves as both a bit of fun and quirky eye-candy and as a way to draw much-needed attention to a more serious subject. Without giving too much of the story within the playable Doodle away, the game starts out with a¬†pangolin checking his mail on Valentine‚Äôs Day to find a letter from its significant other who lives someplace far away. As he rushes to pack his things, he realizes that he doesn‚Äôt actually have any Valentine‚Äôs Day gifts for the pangolin he loves. Upon seeing another couple of fellow pangolins sharing a chocolate cake, the love-stricken pangolin sets about finding cocoa beans to make a cake of his own. The story starts out in Ghana¬†but then moves through three other countries including China, India, and the Philippines. Each level is uniquely crafted to capture some aspect of the culture found within the country that level takes place in. The game also manages to make use of some little-known facts about pangolins. For example, pangolins are excellent swimmers, despite looking like they‚Äôd simply sink in water. Using that fact, Google was able to include some ‚Äúwater level‚Äù aspects to the gameplay. They also curl up into a ball as a defensive posture, so Google made rolling the character‚Äôs primary means transportation.¬†In addition to the fun, Google uses the loading screens for each level to provide various facts about Pangolins in the real world. For example, there are 8 species of the scaled insectivores spread across Africa and Asia, including the countries featured in the game itself. Pangolins are also endangered from poaching for food and tribal medicines, as well as habitat loss, which is likely the reason the company chose to bring attention to them with the Doodle-based game. Unfortunately, the game is only likely to be the feature on Google‚Äôs search for a day or so before being taken down, just as with most Doodles ‚Äì though it will almost certainly live on in the company‚Äôs long-standing repository of past Doodles. For those without immediate access to a computer, Google‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day Doodle is also playable on mobile now that support has been added¬†to the Google app. Post navigation New LG G6 Teaser Focuses On Durability Deal: Lifetime Subscription of IDrive Unlimited Mobile Backup for $19.99 ‚Äì 2/14/17 February 14, 2017 | Android News Source: Google Via: The Next Web Show Comments Hide Comments () Latest News Huawei P10 Leaks In Blue, Green And Yellow Color Variants YouTube (Desktop) Receives Material Redesign And Dark Mode Moto G5 Plus Press Materials Leak, Design & Specs Revealed Sundar Pichai Responds To A 7-Year-Old‚Äôs Job Application LG‚Äôs G6 Has A FullVision Display With An 18:9 Aspect Ratio Win An NVIDIA SHIELD (2017) With Android Headlines ‚Äì International Giveaway A New Moto X May Have Just Passed Through The FCC Phone Comparisons: Moto Z Force vs ASUS ZenFone AR Huawei‚Äôs P10 Plus Seems To Have Leaked In Press Renders Play Store App Updates Can Be Handled By The APKUpdater App Tech Talk: Banks Are Hoping To Replace ATM Cards With Smartphones Best Robot Vacuum Review ‚Äì Dyson 360 Eye, iRobot Roomba 980, Xiaomi Mi Robot Huawei Is Reportedly Building A Digital Assistant Of Its Own Alphabet‚Äôs Access Division Hires Greg McCray As CEO ASUS Reveals The Cost Of Their ZenFone 3 Zoom In Taiwan Download: You Can Share Voicemails In Google Phone 8.0 Google Explains some of their Choices in Making the Pixel Google Officially Announces The Launch Of Android Wear 2.0 The Google News Fact Check Tag Is Coming To More Countries U.S. Cellular-Branded LG Flagship Hits Geekbench Pick Up the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio Wireless Portable Speaker for $96 ‚Äì 2/15/17 Load More Posts Follow Share

According to Bloomberg, Google paid its self-driving car experts so much money that they didn‚Äôt need the job security and decided to quit. The report states that some of the first workers from Google‚Äôs autonomous vehicle business had "an unusual compensation system" that awarded payouts based on the project‚Äôs value and performance. As well as earning their standard salaries, the employees received bonuses and equity in the business, which had multipliers applied based on periodic valuations of the division. Some payments reached into the millions of dollars - one member of the team had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed over four years. The two staffers Bloomberg talked to referred to the payments as ‚Äúf-you money.‚Äù As more key milestones were reached, more money was handed over to the workers. In the end, they were paid so much that they lost any incentive to stay at Google. Former project leader Chris Urmson left to co-found a startup with ex-Tesla employee Sterling Anderson. Others left to form self-driving truck firm Otto, which has since been acquired by Uber. And former Google car exec Bryan Salesky started Argo AI. The generous system was replaced when the self-driving car division spun off into the new Waymo unit back in December, but the scheme had cost parent company Alphabet a lot of money. It lost $3.5 billion on ‚Äúother bets‚Äù in 2015, which includes the self-driving car business. Even with all the resources being poured into the technology right now, it‚Äôll take many more years before self-driving cars become mainstream. Alphabet may have to wait a long time before it sees a return on its investment.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 was spotted inside Geekbench's online database running a version of Android 7.0, suggesting that the latest version of the popular mobile OS will soon hit the slate. Google officially released Android Nougat in August 2016, with the company's own Nexus and Pixel devices the first to get the OS before it was offered up to the masses shortly afterwards. It comes with a range of new features such as support for Daydream VR and Google Assistant, plus a new emoji and GIF keyboard. Related: MWC 2017 As is always the case, third-party manufacturers have been slow to roll out the OS, and Samsung is no different in that department. The latest version of Android only arrived on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge last month, but it should be on Samsung‚Äôs next flagship, the Galaxy S8, from the get go. The result of the slow uptake from device manufacturers means fragmentation is still a big problem for Google‚Äôs OS. Just a matter of days ago, Google confirmed that Nougat has reached just over 1% of all Android devices. In fact, most devices are still running the 2014 vintage, Android Lollipop, which sits on a big 32.9% of Android smartphones and tablets. Today‚Äôs news is by no means cast iron confirmation that Nougat is about to arrive on Samsung‚Äôs mini tablet, and it should be noted that it‚Äôs relatively simple to doctor the model number of a unit to create a false set of benchmark results. The fact this is out in the open, though, means that something should materialise soon enough. Watch: Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 review Still waiting for Android Nougat in your device?

Offices as Streaming Flourishes by Nicole Piper More stories by Nicole Piper February 14, 2017, 5:00 AM EST February 14, 2017, 11:25 AM EST Landlords benefit from convergence of entertainment and tech Media tenants occupy region‚Äôs most office space this decade ‚ÄúHouse of Cards‚Äù needs more room. Netflix Inc., the streaming service that‚Äôs home to the political drama, last month leased an entire five-story office building in Hollywood, less than three months after signing a decade-long deal for adjacent stages and production offices, bringing its total space in the Sunset Bronson Studios complex to more than 500,000 square feet (46,500 square meters) -- roughly the size of five Wal-Mart stores. Shared office space in Playa Vista. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg The surge in online television viewing is spurring a wave of big real estate deals, as companies such as Netflix, Amazon.com Inc. and Google snap up space to cope with increased production demands. The amount of office space the entertainment industry occupies in Los Angeles County has climbed to the most this decade, with media tenants in 25.5 million square feet, up 2.99 million square feet from five years earlier, according to brokerage CBRE Group Inc. The space the streaming companies lease has evolved from the small offices of a few years ago to the giant production facilities typically associated with traditional Hollywood studios. ‚ÄúThe sort of boom around those marketplaces has been specific to the digital media and the entertainment world converging with the technology world,‚Äù said Victor Coleman, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based¬† Hudson Pacific Properties Inc., Netflix‚Äôs landlord at Sunset Bronson Studios. The surge in leasing by entertainment companies reaches from downtown L.A. and Hollywood to Playa Vista, once a stretch of marshland between Los Angeles International Airport and Venice that‚Äôs become known as ‚ÄúSilicon Beach‚Äù because of an influx of media companies and digital startups. Entertainment-industry growth has helped an office market hurt by a years-long exodus of traditional users of corporate space, including hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp., both of which moved to Virginia. Like Netflix, BuzzFeed Motion Pictures set up offices in Hollywood, while Amazon Studios is in Santa Monica and producers of original shows for Hulu‚Äôs service have used space at Culver City‚Äôs historic Culver Studios,¬†where classics such as ‚ÄúGone With the Wind‚Äù and ‚ÄúCitizen Kane‚Äù were filmed. Netflix‚Äôs expanded Southern California facilities will be spread across multiple buildings at Sunset Bronson Studios, former home of Warner Bros. Studios, where ‚ÄúThe Jazz Singer,‚Äù the movie industry‚Äôs first ‚Äútalkie,‚Äù was filmed in 1927. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on in L.A. now is very similar to what we saw many years ago, when the cable companies were growing rapidly,‚Äù said Jeff Pion, a vice chairman at Los Angeles-based CBRE. Rising demand for digital content, and the additional production that comes with it, mirrors the era when¬†cable subscriptions climbed and new TV channels brought viewers more options, he said. Read More: A QuickTake on the Streaming Revolution Hollywood isn‚Äôt alone in offering historic facilities to new-media companies. Playa Vista -- where companies including Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google, Facebook Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. now have space -- is on land that once was an airstrip for pilot and movie producer Howard Hughes, an allure not lost on its current tenants. A Story ‚ÄúEveryone wants to work where Howard Hughes was,‚Äù said Alison Girard, Brookfield Residential‚Äôs director of marketing for Playa Vista. ‚ÄúThey want to come to a place with a story.‚Äù The ‚ÄôSpruce Goose‚Äô hangar under renovation. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Google was one of the first companies to migrate south from Silicon Valley in 2003, initially setting up shop in Santa Monica before moving to Venice Beach. In 2014, it acquired 12 acres (4.9 hectares) in Playa Vista,¬†including the hangar where Hughes built his ‚ÄúSpruce Goose‚Äù airplane. Google‚Äôs YouTube unit also has about 41,000 square feet next door under a long-term lease. Last week, real estate developer Tishman Speyer announced that it leased more than 50,000 square feet of creative office space in Playa Vista to¬†Loyola Marymount University for its School of Film and Television graduate programs. Oscar Nomination Demand for space is being bolstered by both commercial and critical successes for the streaming services. Netflix signed up a record 7.05 million new customers in the fourth quarter, topping analysts‚Äô estimates for domestic and international growth to cap the company‚Äôs first year as a global online-TV service. Its show ‚ÄúHouse of Cards,‚Äù an Emmy nominee for¬†outstanding drama series last year, returns for a fifth season in May. Amazon, meanwhile, last month made history by becoming the first¬†online-video service to receive an Academy Awards best picture nomination, for ‚ÄúManchester by the Sea,‚Äù which secured a total of six Oscar nominations. Entertainment companies have very different demands from those of older L.A. tenants like Hilton, Northrop and Occidental Petroleum Co., which moved to Houston in 2015. In Playa Vista, offices are spacious and relaxed, with young people in leggings and beanies working on their laptops while lounging on couches, sunk into beanbag chairs or perched on bar stools. Neon signs with inspirational phrases hang on the walls, while sliding doors link indoor dining rooms to outdoor patios strewn with hammocks and foliage. Employees‚Äô dogs run from room to room. ‚ÄúOur mom and dads‚Äô office space is not the office space we want to work in today,‚Äù said Brookfield‚Äôs Girard, adding that the style once favored mostly by technology and media companies is catching on with traditional office tenants. ‚ÄúNow banks and lawyers want creative space too.‚Äù YouTube Proximity Fullscreen Inc. offices. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Streaming service and content producer Fullscreen Inc. moved into its Playa Vista offices almost two years ago, and CEO George Strompolos said the open floor plan and modern amenities fostered the kind of creativity that drives the company‚Äôs business model. Proximity to YouTube and other similar companies was also a big draw. ‚ÄúWe kind of liked the idea of what was brewing with the Silicon Beach community,‚Äù Strompolos said. ‚ÄúWe like our neighbors, most of which are collaborators, some of which are competitors. It keeps it interesting.‚Äù Read More: Disney Dumps YouTube Star for Anti-Semitic Content Cheryl Idell, West Coast lead of marketing firm MindShare,¬†which moved from Santa Monica to Playa Vista in June 2015, also said the open spaces allow for collaboration and a more relaxed environment. CBRE‚Äôs Pion predicted that older media companies such as CBS Corp. and 21st Century Fox Inc. will start to retool their offices to offer the type of amenities millennials have come to expect, and some companies have already taken steps in that direction. Cheryl Idell Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Warner Music Group leased a 257,000-square-foot renovated Ford auto plant in downtown L.A.‚Äôs trendy Arts District, and Viacom Inc. has consolidated its West Coast operations, which were scattered across the region, from Burbank to Santa Monica, into one central Hollywood office building leased from Kilroy Realty Corp. New Model ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got all the existing studio companies, which is Sony, Fox, Disney and Warner Bros., and they‚Äôre not just going to say, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôre going to stick to the old model,‚Äô‚Äù said Coleman, the Hudson Pacific CEO, whose company had 42.2 percent of its tenants in the tech industry and 13.6 percent in entertainment last year. The expansion of streaming companies‚Äô office space has coincided with L.A.‚Äôs efforts to attract more production. Last year, revised incentives were introduced, which led to 6.2 percent more shooting days than in 2015, while the number of feature films shot in L.A. jumped 12 percent, according to FilmL.A. Inc., the official film office for the city and county. New media, however, has used few tax incentives, with only¬†Hulu‚Äôs ‚ÄúCitizen,‚Äù Netflix‚Äôs ‚Äú13 Reasons Why‚Äù and Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Girls Revolt,‚Äù which has been canceled, receiving subsidies last year, said Philip Sokoloski, a FilmL.A. spokesman. Casual Attire The convergence of entertainment and tech has created new outlets for production while also leading to greater use of office space. Technological advancements have scaled down the number of people required to work on sound stages and boosted demand for offices as employees move behind computers. Still, not all buildings are benefiting. Traditional office properties are still coping with high vacancies, with younger workers expecting the catered food, open floor plans and ultra-casual dress codes that are rare in towers home to accounting and law firms.

For Parisa Tabriz, dubbed as Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúSecurity Princess,‚Äù a full security in the internet is never guaranteed no matter how much precaution you put into place, especially when attackers like hackers are very determined and well-funded. But Tabriz, who manages Google‚Äôs information security engineering team, noted that users can always try to make it difficult for attackers to exploit them and their personal data. ADVERTISEMENT ‚ÄúWe have more challenges ahead for sure, but we have a shared responsibility to secure the internet,‚Äù Tabriz told Manila-based journalists in a video conference at Google Philippines‚Äô headquarters in Taguig. In line with the celebration of Safer Internet Day last Feb. 7, Tabriz shared the following four security tips to maintain a safe and secure online environment: Don‚Äôt reuse or share same password. ‚ÄúHackers know that people reuse the same password, and so what they will do is target especially weak websites to extract passwords from all users of that website, look at a full database of passwords, and try to use those in other multiple platforms. When you use the same passwords, it‚Äôs more like a secret‚Äîthe more people you tell about it, the more likely it is to be known,‚Äù Tabriz said. Acknowledging the difficulty in remembering a different password for every single site, Tabriz recommended the use of a password manager, which makes it possible for the technology to remember different passwords across multiple platforms. Never log in on shared computers and strengthen the security settings of your account Tabriz said shared public computers are more likely to have malware in a form of keylogger, which can remember keyboard strokes and possibly send passwords to attackers. ‚ÄúThink of it as having a lot of germs from other people. You don‚Äôt want to put something sensitive into something that has a lot of germs,‚Äù she said. The Google security princess urged users to verify their account security settings where they can¬†check the places and devices where they logged in their accounts and use a ‚Äúsecond layer‚Äù of protection through the two-step verification process. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt own an iPhone and you see that somebody who has an iPhone has logged in to your account, then that might be suspicious. What‚Äôs more important to do here is to add a second-factor authentication to your account because there is a risk that your password gets leaked,‚Äù Tabriz added. Be mindful of all software or applications you install on your computer and phone ‚ÄúThis is challenging because if you‚Äôre not a security expert, or even if you are a security expert, it‚Äôs difficult to tell what‚Äôs a legitimate software versus an attacker trying to fool somebody,‚Äù Tabriz said. The security expert recommended the use of Google Safe Browsing which ‚Äúregularly scans all sites on the web and opens every website in its own quarantine machine.‚Äù ‚ÄúBased on the behavior of that site, based on our online analysis, we will be able to determine if this site is bad and put it into a blacklist. If you try to log in to these sites on Chrome, instead of directing you to that site, we are going to send you a red warning,‚Äù she added. Keep your software up to date Tabriz highlighted the importance of regularly installing updates because they usually come with security updates that solve critical security bugs. ‚ÄúIf you are not installing those updates, then you leave yourself open and vulnerable to attackers,‚Äù she said. Aside from the above-mentioned tips, Google also recommends the following measures to avoid being a victim of cybercrime: -Use a long password made up of numbers, letters and symbols. -Many services will send an email to you at a recovery email address if you need to reset your password, so make sure your recovery email address is up-to-date and an account you can still access. -Don‚Äôt reply if you see a suspicious email, instant message or webpage asking for your personal or financial information. -Never enter your password if you‚Äôve arrived at a site by following a link in an email or chat that you don‚Äôt trust. -Don‚Äôt send your password via email, and don‚Äôt share it with others. -Beware of strangers bearing gifts. If someone tells you you‚Äôre a winner and asks you to fill out with your personal information, don‚Äôt be tempted to start filling it out. -Do your research. When shopping online, research the seller and be wary of suspiciously low prices just like you would if you were buying something at a local store. -When in doubt, play it safe. Only click on ads or buy products from sites that are safe, reviewed and trusted. -You should always lock your screen when you finish using your computer, laptop or phone. For added security, you should also set your device to automatic lock when it goes to sleep. -Use secure networks. It‚Äôs good to be extra careful whenever you go online using a network you don‚Äôt know or trust‚Äîlike using the free Wi-Fi at your local cafe. -Know your Google security and privacy tools (2-step verification, account settings, incognito mode, Google Dashboard, Ads Settings, Google+ Circles). play_circle_filled New wave of robots set to deliver the goods February 05, 2017 play_circle_filled Nintendo reboots with new Switch game console January 15, 2017 play_circle_filled Avatar-style South Korean manned robot takes first baby steps January 04, 2017 play_circle_filled 'Heart-in-a-box' device helps save lives January 04, 2017 TAGS: Google, Internet, Online attacks, Philippine news updates For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.
