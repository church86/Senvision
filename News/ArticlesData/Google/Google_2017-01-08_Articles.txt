Well, it’s starter code, but the significance is there. The Google app for Android got an update to its beta version today bringing it to version 6.10. Android Police tore down the .apk and found a couple other feature adds within the code. As always, beta code is not final code. The features previewed now could disappear or change in how it is executed before the final update. One such feature, you could argue, should’ve been with Assistant in the first place: text input. Sure, you could plug into Google’s chat app Allo to do that, but the regular user might not associate instant text access to Google Assistant with Allo. And there are some sensitive conditions that bring in the need for dropping the voice component of interacting with the Assistant. A keyboard logo in the Google Assistant UI will signify when you’ll be able to type your query. Search gestures are a new feature. As Kevin Barry, developer of Nova Launcher, noted, the code used in this incarnation of the action looks very similar to that found in Google’s open source launcher3 project that allows users to swipe down from anywhere on the home screen to trigger an action. Extra code found in this incarnation could trigger more things within either the Google Now or Pixel Launcher — though it’s not clear what we’re looking at just yet. Android Police‘s sister site, APKMirror, has a signed copy of the update app. Hit the source link for that. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

T3 The Gadget Website Search News Reviews Mobile Entertainment Wearables More Living Auto Magazine More Tech in depth Best deals iPhone 7 PlayStation 4 Pro MacBook Pro Amazon Echo Dot Daydream View Get fit News Kuri is the robot that gives home assistant devices a personality Kuri is the robot that gives home assistant devices a personality By Joseph Carey   Echo and Home don't have that adorable look Shares There seems to be a recent trend of having robotic assistants in the home, and while the Amazon Echo and Google Home offer conveniences for users, they lack an emotional impact that a more traditional robot solution does. The answer to this comes in the form of Kuri, a device created by Mayfield Robotics that was one of the most popular robots to be shown at CES 2017.   Kuri is designed to help you around the house, but not in the way Amazon and Google are doing it. Instead this little robot, that measures up at 50 centimetres tall, is crammed full of technology to help differentiate itself from the less adorable house helpers on the market. Loudspeakers, microphones, a camera and sensors are just some of the technologies Kuri has inside itself.   All of these technologies culminate to create a robot that can be useful in a ton of different situations — the robot can alert parents if their children have made it home from school and the camera can be used in conjunction with the Kuri smartphone application to allow users a glimpse inside their home when they’re away. This is the cutest mobile home camera on the market.    Kuri acts as your shadow, following you around the house, learning the interior of your home to make note of the quickest routes around it. The robot has been designed to do more emotional tasks like read your children bedtime stories through audiobooks or play you a podcast while you get ready for work in the morning.   The robot doesn't speak English and instead shows emotion through its eyes, movement of its head and bleep bloop language. Kuri is a robot that moves around your home, isn't a vacuum and on paper seems to have all the cute boxes checked off with a few practical ones too. The device isn't going to be able to do calculations for you or search the web, but for every task it can't do, it’s got an adorable one in compensation. Kuri is currently available for pre-order and will retail for $699 (£575). You’ll be able to have this little robot following you around when it releases at the end of 2017.

Mountain View, California, Google/Alphabet's backyard, is one of several suburban locales where driverless minivans will soon roam free in their natural habitat. In a speech made to a Detroit auto show, the CEO of Google's recently spun-off self-driving car technology division Waymo announced that a fleet of Chrysler hybrid vehicles with Waymo equipment would be hitting public roads in Mountain View, California and Phoenix, Arizona this month. The Associated Press reported the announcement, which is in keeping with hints Waymo dropped last month when revealing its designs. Rather than developing its own vehicles from scratch, Google announced in mid-December that it would outfit existing cars — Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans for starters — with its autonomous hardware (sensors, cameras) and software. A first look at the vans was provided later last month from Waymo, a division of Google parent company Alphabet formerly run under its X division. "Mom, can you send the minivan to come pick me up from soccer practice today?" #NAIAS2017 pic.twitter.com/reUmaDZqzC— Andrew J. Hawkins (@andyjayhawk) January 8, 2017 The Verge provides details of the cost-saving techniques touted by Waymo's CEO John Krafcik in that Detroit speech. Waymo is now in the business of building its own LIDAR sensors, for example, and is in fact creating or contracting out all of its custom hardware parts rather than buying them off the shelf, so to speak. That move was made to dramatically lower the cost of equipping cars like the Pacifica hybrid for autonomous driving, Krafcik claimed. Although San Franciscans might meet a fleet of self-driving Google minivans with the cold reception that's now customary for "Google buses" and self-driving Ubers, Peninsula drivers are perhaps better accustomed to playing the guinea pig: Waymo's logo on Google's pod-like car prototypes, for example, can be seen with frequency in Palo Alto, Mountain View, and elsewhere. Finally, the Verge gestures to possible long-term aspirations like a Waymo-Chrysler ride-hailing company. We'll keep up with that hypothesis, but we're assuming we'll have a heads up first. Google's "Don't be evil" mantra, at odds with the ethos of self-driving car rival Uber, will likely ensure that they seeks the permits Uber lacked before beginning to test any such service.

How globalists predict your behavior Posted on January 10, 2017January 9, 2017 by Brandon Smith Views: 3,642 199 Shares The globalists seem to have an overarching obsessions with data collection. As we have seen with revelations from multiple government whistle-blowers, the establishment spends most of its time, energy and manpower collecting information not just on known threats to their supremacy, but information on everyone through FISA-based surveillance protocols. This is because the establishment sees all people as potential threats. Thus, the system, without warrant, is programmed to collate data from everywhere, not necessarily to be analyzed on the spot, but to be analyzed later in the event that a specific person rises to a level that poses legitimate harm to the globalist power structure. There was a time not long ago when this notion was considered “conspiracy theory” by the mainstream, but with multiple exposures from Wikileaks to Edward Snowden it is now common knowledge that the government (and the globalists) spy on us en masse. However, I do not think that many people understand the greater implications or uses for this full spectrum surveillance. This is why you sometimes hear the argument that “if you aren’t doing anything wrong, then you have nothing to worry about…” The truth is, mass surveillance is not done merely for the sake of surveillance, and it is certainly not undertaken for the sake of public safety. There is a greater purpose, and it is something the elites crave dearly — the purpose of total and predictive information awareness. The establishment is not just hoping to observe our present behavior in detail. No, they hope to use today’s data to predict our behavior tomorrow, and at this very moment, they are extremely close to achieving their goal. Lets examine some of the methods they use in the pursuit of this goal… Internet macro-analytics Web analytics are used by almost everyone with a website of their own, and Google is a primary source for this data. Through analytics you can easily measure web traffic for a particular site, but also where in the world the traffic is coming from, how long these people are staying on your site, how many of them are new visitors versus regular visitors, how your traffic has increased or decreased over a span of months or years, etc, etc. That said analytics are not just useful to someone with a web-based business or a blog, they are very useful to the establishment. Why? Because they allow the establishment to view the behavior of most of a population at any given time. In fact, Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, is notorious for opening his big mouth and letting slip some of the finer intricacies of the establishment’s information war. In 2010 in a videotaped interview with The Atlantic, Schmidt said this: “With your permission, you give us more information about you, about your friends, and we can improve the quality of our searches. We don’t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you’ve been. We can more or less know what you’re thinking about.” Now, this statement from Schmidt is not entirely true. The use of analytics to know the thought processes of the individual person is nonsensical because, first, individuals can be highly erratic and unpredictable due to emotion, intuition and abrupt changes in psychological dynamic. The elites do not know what you are thinking, yet. That said, they do have the tools at their disposal to use what I would call “macro-analytics,” a widely encompassing view of internet traffic, to predict group behavior. The ability to track the web habits of an entire population allows the elites to see shifts in social consciousness in real time. For example, I believe this very method was used to predict the shift of the U.S. population and parts of Europe towards a more conservative or “populist” ideal in 2016. Because of this the elites have acted accordingly. Instead of attempting to stop the social changes of the group, they have allowed conservative and sovereignty movements to attain a certain level of political power, while also setting those same movements up for epic failure in the next couple of years. I also predicted this move by the elites in advance before the Brexit Referendum (I will go into more detail on this in my next article). The point is, the elites do not necessarily need to spend the incredible amount of energy required to spy on each individual. When people form into ideological groups their behavior becomes much easier to predict. Through macro-analytics, the establishment can simply watch the traffic numbers of conservative and liberty sites to see how quickly a population is adopting that mindset, or abandoning it. They can read these social movements in advance and move to intercept or co-opt. Even if everyone in a given population found a way to use the web anonymously, this would do nothing to prevent the establishment from collecting wider analytic data and traffic data. The best strategy for defusing this weapon at the fingertips of the elites would be a decentralized internet; an internet in which analytics are not collected or cannot be collected. Whether this can be done using existing internet infrastructure or if it would require the freedom minded to start all over from scratch, I do not know. All I know is that while the existing system is indeed useful to liberty advocates as a means to spread information and to counter disinformation, it is also highly useful to the elites as a means to view and predict mass behavior. It is a trade-off, and it is hard to say who is getting the better part of the trade. For the establishment, though, the internet is quickly becoming, for all intents and purposes, the all seeing eye. Human integration with the internet Here is where Eric Schmidt’s claim of Google “knowing what you are thinking” could actually come true. Yet another statement from Schmidt in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter breaks down exactly what a human integration with the web might entail: “There will be so many IP addresses… so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with that you won’t even sense it. … It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room, and the room is dynamic. And with your permission and all of that, you are interacting with the things going on in the room.” Note that Schmidt keeps bringing up the idea that they will have your “permission” to watch your life and actions in such vivid detail. The elites seem to love the idea of consent. Meaning, they take joy in tricking people into consenting to their own slavery. Surely, if the average person knew the extent to which their information would be used by the establishment against them, then they would not consent to a thing. But the elites figure that your ignorance and participation is enough consent for them. Case in point, the “internet of things” which Schmidt is describing, is already here. Not only can spy agencies tap into your web activity and your computer microphone and webcam, but also your cell phone activity. This includes the ability to use cell phone GPS to track every move you make in real time. But cell phones can also be activated while turned off (as long as they have battery power), and your conversations can be recorded while you are none-the-wiser. The cell phone is also a powerful tool for video surveillance. Cell phone makers are now getting ready to equip products with facial recognition software, allowing organizations like the NSA to not only track you with your own cell phone, but also track you through other people’s cell phones if they happen to capture your face in their own phone camera. New products are even more invasive. Amazon’s latest “Echo” technology, featuring “Alexa,” an app which allows the Echo to interpret your commands via microphone and talk back to you, is essentially a highly sensitive listening device which people are paying good money for and willingly centralizing in their homes. This is so Orwellian it is astonishing. Though Amazon claims the Echo only records audio for 60 seconds at a time and has refused to give data to the government in two separate instances for use in court prosecutions, the fact is that Amazon does have the data. And, if Amazon has access, then the NSA has access. It is foolish to assume otherwise. The federal pursuit of warrants to gain the data for use in court cases is nothing more than a show designed to normalize the practice of exploiting these devices and make the idea more palatable to the public. If the data can be used to solve a crime, then how can such surveillance be bad, after all? What Schmidt envisions, and I think what the globalists envision, are millions of households filled with devices like the Echo. Not only this, but they also envision every human being reliant on the “internet of things” every moment of every day. They want a world in which you can’t accomplish any necessary activity without interacting with the network. They want a world in which everything you say and do is recorded and modeled and profiled. We are not quite there yet, but we are not far off, and if such a world comes to pass, then the elites will, in a sense, be able to predict individual thought and behavior. Countering the surveillance grid In my next article I will be outlining more methods for countering establishment intrusions into your life. Not only that, but I will also be explaining how you can turn the tables and predict the behavior of the elites. In the meantime, the best solution to the problem is to distance one’s self from the grid wherever possible. This means doing simple things, like leaving your cell phone at home when it is not really necessary. I grew up in an era without cell phones. Trust me, we got by just fine without them. It also means being more present-minded on the technology in your home and what it does. Do you really need your webcam overlooking your house all day long? Does your computer really need to be operating every second? Do you really need to take pictures of your entire life and post them on Facebook? Can you not limit your desire for every new gadget that happens to come along? Humanity needs a healthy distance from technology. This doesn’t mean we go back to using a horse and buggy, but it does mean there is wisdom in moderation. Mass surveillance potential by the establishment is not just a threat to people who might be “up to no good”; it is a threat to everyone. For the ability to predict a population’s behavior makes that population highly controllable. No one is morally benevolent enough to be trusted with that kind of power. Anyone deliberately seeking to obtain such power should be treated with the utmost suspicion. Only the worst of men desire the means to intrude on the lives and minds of men. — Brandon Smith This entry was posted in Featured. Bookmark the permalink.

Much of that has to do with Microsoft’s HoloLens technology, which moved AR to parity with emerging virtual reality (VR) systems, but Microsoft isn’t alone. Another important player in AR is Google, with its Tango initiative that lets smartphones provide on on-screen AR experience using built-in sensors that provide the required motion-tracking, area learning, and depth perception functionality. Tango is making its way into the real world, and one of the first functional applications is in museums starting with the Detroit Institute of Arts, according to the Google blog. More: Google, Qualcomm bring Project Tango tech to Snapdragon processors The idea is simple but powerful: Walk into the facility, and you can request one of the first Tango-enabled smartphones, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Then, when you walk around the museum and marvel at the exhibits, you can use the Lumin app developed in partnership with GuidiGo to overlay an AR experience that great expands on what you can see with the naked eye. For example, without AR, you’d be limited to simply looking at the exterior of the an ancient Egyptian mummy. With Tango, you actually look into the sarcophagus and the mummy’s bandages and peer at the mummy’s actual skeleton. Another example is the ability to extrapolate from the museum’s three-foot by four-foot mosaic piece to the complete Ishtar Gate. Tango’s motion tracking technology makes it possible to visualize the gate’s entire six-story structure and imagine the structure’s actual massive scale. Mesopotamian limestone reliefs also come to live with Tango. While today’s relics are faded and drab, the original reliefs were vibrantly colored — and AR lets you see them in all of their original glory as if thousands of years hadn’t actually passed. Finally, Tango lets you unlock Mesopotamian cylinder seals. Inside, clay impressions that were used to keep track of things like jewelry and signatures can be visualized without breaking the seals. AR holds tremendous promise in terms of allowing us to see things in realistic 3D that are either hidden or have long faded away. Google’s Tango is one of the first affordable real-world systems that can bring AR applications to life, and museums certainly seem like great places to start. Also watch: Share

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 9, 2017 at 6:18PM Image source: John Legere's social media account. CES 2017 is now winding down, but last week T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere held a press conference at the annual tech extravaganza. In it, Legere made eight bold predictions of what the telecommunications industry might have in store for 2017, and also subsequently penned a blog post on T-Mobile's site. Let's go through Legere's calls and see what they could mean for investors. 1. No more cable company MVNOs Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which buy wholesale capacity from the major network operators and resell service under a different brand, have always occupied a tenuous place within the mobile value chain. Facing sluggish landline growth, many cable companies have looked toward establishing MVNOs for some exposure to wireless growth. For instance, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced plans late last year that it would launch an MVNO on Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) network in 2017, supplemented by Wi-Fi hotspots. Legere doesn't think these MVNO ambitions will play out well for anyone, and the Un-carrier will not ink any MVNO agreements with cable operators. 2. Google goes big There are a few candidates for tech giants that may look to jump into the wireless sector, but Legere thinks Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is the most obvious pick. Of course, the search giant launched Project Fi in 2015, which is a sort of hybrid MVNO that uses several networks (including T-Mobile's) in conjunction with Wi-Fi hotspots. Google is experimenting with and pioneering several interesting ideas, such as prorated data fees. Thus far, Project Fi has been limited to a small number of devices, mostly Nexus and Pixel phones, but Google has the groundwork in place if it wants to make a bigger impact. 3. TV goes (more) mobile Over-the-top (OTT) streaming services are proliferating in lockstep with cord-cutting, and Legere sees the shift to mobile accelerating. The chief executive notes that a third of TV watching occurs on devices other than TVs. By the end of 2017, he believes that the majority of TV viewing will be delivered via mobile. Roughly 61% of mobile traffic is video, and this should jump to 77% by 2020, according to CTIA. T-Mobile delivers quite a bit of (downscaled) video for free via its Binge On program, so it only benefits financially from this increased usage if consumers pay extra for high-resolution streams or opt out of Binge On. 4. Say goodbye to DISH DISH Network has been sitting on unused spectrum for years, fueling speculation that it would jump into the wireless world. Legere is calling for "the end of DISH as we know it" this year, saying it will cease to be a stand-alone entity. DISH's TV business has been on the decline, also a victim of cord-cutting, for quite some time. The company lost 116,000 net TV subscribers last quarter, and currently has about 13.6 million subscribers left. 5. Ridiculously fast LTE T-Mobile recently noted that it is already approaching gigabit LTE speeds, thanks to its ongoing investments in spectrum and LTE infrastructure. Other carriers are hoping for gigabit speeds on 5G, but Legere says T-Mobile will be there first using existing technologies. Of course, hitting peak theoretical speeds is quite different than what average consumers experience, and most users won't see gigabit speeds in real-world performance anytime soon. T-Mobile reached 979 Mbps in its labs, using a combination of technologies and an unreleased handset. 6. More people will watch him cook Legere hosts a live-streamed video segment on social media every Sunday under #SlowCookerSunday. Currently, about 500,000 viewers tune in to watch him cook each week, and he predicts he'll have 1 million weekly viewers by the end of 2017. Legere uses his segment as an example of the rise of OTT content, which continues to threaten cable channels. 7. C-suite shakeups This is a pretty bold one, but Legere predicts that three of the four CEOs of the current major wireless operators will be out by year's end. That's an ambitious forecast not only because that's a lot of CEOs losing their jobs, but also because of the ongoing consolidation speculation that T-Mobile isn't exactly downplaying. If T-Mobile ends up merging with Sprint, Legere would immediately score at least one point on this one. 8. Speculating on speculation Pointing to the deterioration in both Verizon's and Comcast's core businesses, Legere says that the two telecom giants will be "forced" to entertain the idea of a blockbuster megamerger that would combine "two of the most hated brands in America." Note that Legere doesn't believe a deal will be officially announced or closed, but rather the pair would have "discussions." Seeing as how discussions of this nature often leak and spur speculation, Legere is essentially speculating on speculation. In fairness, the idea isn't out of the question altogether, given AT&T's recent moves. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But it appears that’s about to change. Maybe. Hopefully. Today there’s a banner at the top of the Google Voice website that says “The New Google Voice is here.” There’s a clickable link to “try now,” and that URL points to: https://www.google.com/voice/b/0/redirection/new. Some people are seeing it, and others are not. But as of right now, heading to that site just reloads the existing Google Voice website without any visible changes or updates. When contacted by The Verge, a Google spokesperson offered this statement acknowledging the slip-up: Sorry, it looks like we must have dialed the wrong number! But don't worry, this wasn't a prank call. We're working on some updates to Google Voice right now. We have you on speed dial and we'll be sure to share what we've been up to just as soon as we can. Google previously attempted to merge some of Google Voice’s functionality with Hangouts. I never really went along with that and still use the apps and desktop website — same as always. They’re not looking so great these days. But with Allo now serving as the company’s primary messaging app, well, perhaps Mountain View is ready to help Google Voice stand on its own again as the awesome service it started as. Make it so, Google. Start off 2017 right. Google Voice has more or less been sitting still without any major feature additions for several years running. On mobile, the iOS app was most recently updated last June with “bug fixes.” (On Android, it was May.) The last significant update before that for iPhone was in October 2015 when the app was updated to support the native display resolutions of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. So yeah... not much has been happening. The service still works fine. It just hasn’t done anything new in forever. Google might just be getting ready to introduce Voice to a new generation.

They include the Uconnect 8.4-inch connected vehicle system featuring Android, as well as Google’s latest driverless technology. FCA is in collaboration with Google regarding the next-generation of connected car systems enabled by Android. “This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers’ increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction,” says Chris Barman, head of electrical engineering at FCA. “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” CES attendees got one-on-one demonstrations of the Uconnect system, which includes core infotainment features such as radio and comfort controls. The software will integrate with Google Assistant, Google Maps and popular Android apps like Pandora, Spotify, NPR One and Pocket Casts. Google’s Waymo unveils self driving system Additionally, Google has unveiled its latest self-driving system in a Chrysler Pacifica minivan, saying the technology is more reliable and affordable. The announcement came from John Krafcik, head of Google’s Waymo unit, whose search for partners to develop and install the company’s autonomous driving technology into real cars has so far yielded only an alliance with FCA and a pending deal with Honda. Krafcik says Waymo’s latest set of self-driving hardware and software incorporates a new array of sensors, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar, all developed and built in-house. So far Waymo has reduced the cost of a single lidar unit by 90%, to about US$7500. Among major outside suppliers of this technology, Velodyne Lidar and Quanergy Systems both have said they are developing smaller solid-state lidar units that eventually would cost $200 or less. Waymo’s existing test fleet of self-driving cars, including some specially equipped Lexus RX450s and Google’s own “Firefly” prototypes, has accumulated 4.02 million kms in less than eight years, mostly on city streets. Waymo plans to test the first self-driving Pacificas this month on public roads in California and Arizona. There was no confirmation on when the system would be ready to install in production vehicles.

It’s relied on too heavily by many users (those like me who have chosen to use the service as their primary phone number), but it’s obvious Google hasn’t been giving the service the attention it so desperately needs. It seems Google is finally getting ready to take Google Voice off the back burner and cook up something good for users with something they’re calling “the new Google Voice.” So what is it? That part’s not immediately clear. Users visiting their Google Voice inbox are being greeted by a banner at the top that says to “The new Google Voice is here,” followed by a big “TRY NOW” link. Unfortunately, the link — https://www.google.com/voice/b/0/redirection/new — doesn’t actually do anything, just refreshes the user’s inbox to the same crusty old version of Google Voice we’ve been using for years now. Go figure. It’s obvious Google got a little ahead of themselves here, publishing the banner before the service has been made officially official. But if we were betting men, we’d put money on Google announcing something new for Google Voice any day now. The big question is whether Google is only planning for a new site redesign, or if this could also mean we’ll be seeing a completely overhauled app as well. *fingers crossed* local_offer    Google Voice   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (13) stars Further Reading Google Voice having trouble sending messages to other GV numbers Google Voice for Android app updated after a year Google Voice's voicemail transcriptions suck 49% less Google Voice user survey looks for feedback Google Voice MMS issue stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertLatest OxygenOS update comes to the OnePlus 3T closeOnePlus pushes the latest OxygenOS Nougat update to the OnePlus 3 and 3T After users were discovered to be unable to download apps from the Play Store, OnePlus released a bug fix update for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T. 2 more_vertGalaxy S8 to have IP68 rating closeSamsung Galaxy S8 is expected to feature IP68 water resistance The Samsung Galaxy S8 is rumored to have IP68 water resistance.

The announcement — which was made at the North American International Auto Show — means that the very polished vehicles will be observable in Mountain View, California, and Phoenix, Arizona … if any readers are inclined to get a closer look. These are the same cities where the company has previously spent a lot of time testing its rather-less-polished and modified self-driving Lexus SUVs. At the North American International Auto Show, Waymo also gave those there a closer look at the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans — the first time that the company has shown them in public. The Verge provides more: “But here’s the thing about these minivans. Waymo says that for the first time, its producing all the technology that enables its cars to completely drive themselves in-house. That means for the first time, the Google spin-off is building all its own cameras, sensors, and mapping technology, rather than purchasing parts off the shelf as it had done in the past.” Continuing: “This allows the company to exert more control over its self-driving hardware, as well as bring the cost down to ridiculously cheap levels. In a speech in Detroit, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said that by building its own LIDAR sensors, for example, the company was shaving 90% off its costs. That means sensors that Google purchased for $75,000 back in 2009 now only cost $7,500 for Waymo to build itself.” That is a pretty impressive drop in costs, and goes to show how underdeveloped the self-driving tech industry was just a few years ago, and how wrong those who thought autonomous vehicles would remain cost-prohibitive for the foreseeable future were. Here’s a bit more from The Verge: “But by building its own (or contracting out the manufacturing), Waymo is able to get LIDAR sensors to its exact specifications. For instance, Krafcik said the company developed two new types of LIDAR: short range and long range, allowing its vehicles to see people and objects very close to the car, as well as spot tiny objects far away.” As a reminder, the company now seems to be focused entirely on providing self-driving tech (like that discussed above) to partner auto manufacturers (Chrysler, Honda, etc.) rather than developing its own car, as was previously reported. There are some rumors out there currently that Waymo and Chrysler are planning to jointly launch an on-demand, self-driving taxi service to compete with companies like Uber and Lyft at some point in the “near” future as well. During his recent speech Krafcik seems to have further confirmed this by stating the the company was exploring a number of options, including: on-demand taxi services, last-mile solutions, personal transportation, and logistics.

Eric Schmidt, center, executive chairman of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, and chair of the Defense Innovation Advisory Board, speaks to reporters at the Pentagon following the board's second meeting, Jan. 9. 2017.

DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando Download Image Image details page The 15-member board is chaired by Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. "I think I can speak for the entire board to say that we are really happy to be able to serve the country in the way that we have," Schmidt said at the start of today's public meeting. "Everybody here is a volunteer. We've had a wonderful time." Board members are continually impressed by the focus, courage and discipline of the service members they meet around the globe, Schmidt said. "It's important when you sit here in Washington to remember there's a much larger space of people who are out basically fighting the good fight in an impressive way," he added. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Schmidt said he believes the board will continue its work under the incoming administration and that it will be "business as usual" with the new secretary of defense. "We are a discretionary board -- the way it's structured is we continue at the discretion of the secretary," he explained. "We have every reason to believe that it will continue." Approval of Recommendations The board held its inaugural meeting in October. In today's 90-minute session, the board discussed and approved 11 recommendations and discussed a new one. The attendees included Marne Levine, chief operating officer of Instagram; retired Navy Adm. William McRaven, a former commander of U.S. Special Operations Command who now is chancellor of the University of Texas System; and astrophysicist and author Neil deGrasse Tyson. Other members at today's meeting were Adam Grant, professor, Wharton School of Business; Eric Lander, president and founding director, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; J. Michael McQuade, senior vice president for science and technology, United Technologies; Milo Medin, vice president, Access Services, Google Capital; Jennifer Pahlka, founder, Code for America; and Cass Sunstein, professor, Harvard Law School. Defense Secretary Ash Carter established the board last year for a two-year renewable term. The panel is authorized to have up to 20 members. The board also includes Jeff Bezos, president, chairman and CEO, Amazon Inc.; Danny Hillis, computer theorist and co-founder, Applied Inventions; Reid Hoffman, co-founder, LinkedIn, and partner, Greylock Partners; Walter Isaacson, president and CEO, Aspen Institute; and Richard Murray, professor, California Institute of Technology. Recommendations for the Department Members today approved recommendations to: -- Appoint a chief innovation officer and build innovation capacity in the workforce; -- Embed computer science as a core competency of the department through recruiting and training; -- Embrace a culture of experimentation; -- Assess cybersecurity vulnerabilities of advanced weapons; -- Catalyze innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning; -- Expand use of available acquisition waivers and exemptions; -- Increase investment in new approaches to innovation; -- Improve DoD access to code; -- Establish software development teams at each major command; -- Make computing and bandwidth abundant; -- Reward bureaucracy busting; and -- Lower barriers to innovation. The members also discussed a new recommendation to establish a global and secure repository for data collection, sharing and analysis, but did not vote on that idea. Implementing Recommendations The board's executive director, Joshua Marcuse, pointed out that Carter announced in October he had formally accepted board recommendations to create a DoD chief innovation officer, embed computer science as a core competency, and create a DoD center for artificial intelligence and machine learning. Today's vote finalizes the recommendations and will include any updated language, Marcuse said. The secretary's staff has begun a process of how to best to implement those three ideas, he added. The Defense Innovation Advisory Board operates under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the Government in Sunshine Act.  (Follow Lisa Ferdinando on Twitter: @FerdinandoDoD) Related Biographies Ash Carter Related Links Special Report: Force of the Future Related Factsheets Recommendations for the Meeting on Jan. 9, 2017 carter Force of Future SecDef News News Articles Casualty Releases Press Advisories News Transcripts Publications Speeches Contracts Testimony Messages Special Reports Secretary of Defense Biography Speeches Testimony Photos Deputy Secretary of Defense Biography Speeches Photos Photos/Videos Photo Essays Week in Photos DoD Video News Other Pentagon Press Badges Press/Media Queries Military Commissions Other News Sources Recent News Articles 01/11/2017 Face of Defense: Midshipman Awarded Navy and Marine Corps Medal for Heroism 01/11/2017 Counter-ISIL Strikes Continue in Syria, Iraq 01/10/2017 Carter: DoD Remains Ready During Transition 01/10/2017 Army Engineers, Coast Guard Partner to Chart U.S. Water Navigation’s Future 01/10/2017 Face of Defense: Soldier Comforts Families of Fallen 01/10/2017 Coalition Targets ISIL Terrorists in Syria, Iraq 01/09/2017 Dunford Hosts Armed Forces Farewell Tribute to Carter 01/09/2017 Advisory Board Approves 11 DoD Innovation Recommendations 01/09/2017 Counter-ISIL Forces Moving to Liberate Mosul, Raqqa 01/09/2017 Face of Defense: Army NCO Balances Duty, Writing Career Quick Links Quick Links DoD Sites Contact Us DVIDS Available Jobs within DoD Privacy and Security Links Disclaimer Inspector General Recovery Act DoD Section 508 Join the Military Web Policy No FEAR Act Resources FOIA Site Map Plain Writing Act Limitations of Visual Information MILITARY SERVICES UNIFIED COMBATANT COMMANDS Stay Connected

Min is a Web browser with a minimal design that provides speedy operation with simple features. When it comes to software design, "minimal" does not mean low functionality or undeveloped potential. If you like minimal distraction tools for your text editor and note-taking applications, that same comfort appeal is evident in the Min browser. I mostly use Google Chrome, Chromium and Firefox on my desktops and laptop computers. I am well invested in their add-on functionality, so I can access all the specialty services that get me through my long sessions in researching and working online. However, I sometimes prefer a fast, uncluttered alternative on-ramp to the Internet. With multiple projects in progress, I can amass a wide collection of open tabs or even separate windows of the powerhouse browsers in no time. I have tried other browser options with little success. The alternatives usually have their own sets of distracting add-ons and features that tend to pull me into more off-task behavior. The Min browser does not do that. It is a GitHub-sourced Web browser that is easy to use, and it keeps the typical interruptions from distracting me. The Min browser is minimal-design Web browser that provides speedy operation with simple features. Just don't expect to take its tour any time soon. What It Does The Min browser comes in versions for Debian Linux variants, Windows and Mac machines. It can not compete with the functionality available in the mainstream cross-platform Web browsers. It does not have to compete, though. Its claim to fame very well might be supplementing rather than replacing them. One big reason for this is its built-in ad blocking capability. Out of the box, the Min browser needs no configuration or hunting for compatible third-party apps to do end-runs around ads. In Edit/Preferences, you have three options to click/unclick for content blocking. It's easy to modify blocking tactics to suit your preferences. The Block Trackers and Ads option uses EasyList and EasyPrivacy. If nothing else, keep this option checked. You also can block scripts and block images. Doing both maximizes the website loading speeds and really ramps up your protection against rogue code attacks. Have Search Your Way If you spend considerable time doing online research, you will adore the way Min handles searching. It is a top-notch feature. Search functionality is accessible right in the browser's URL bar. Min utilizes search engine DuckDuckGo and Wikipedia entries. You can enter search queries directly into the Web address field. This approach saves time since you do not have to go to the search engine window first. A nice bonus is the ability to search your bookmarks. In the Edit/Preferences menu, choose your choice for default search engine. The list includes DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Wikipedia and Yandex. Try making DuckDuckGo your default search engine. Min is built around that option but does not impose it on you. Min browser's search functionality is part of the URL bar. Min utilizes search engine DuckDuckGo and Wikipedia entries. You can enter search queries directly into the Web address window. The search bar displays answers to your questions very rapidly. It uses information from DuckDuckGo including Wikipedia entries, a calculator and more. It offers quick snippets, answers and Web suggestions. It sort of substitutes for not being in a Google-based environment. Navigating Aids Min lets you jump to any site quickly with fuzzy search. It throws suggestions at you almost immediately. I like the way the tabs open next to the current tab. You do not have to set this preference. It is there by default with no other choice, but it makes sense. One of Min's really cool operations is the ability to organize tabs into Tasks that you can search anytime. (click image to enlarge) Tabs you have not clicked on for a while dim. This lets you concentrate on your current task without distractions. Min does not need an add-on tool to keep numerous tabs under control. The browser displays a list of tags and lets you split them into groups. Stay Focused Min has an optional Focus Mode hidden in the View menu. When enabled, it hides all tabs except the one you have opened. You must return to the menu to turn off Focus Mode before you can open new tabs. The Tasks feature also helps you stay focused. You can create tasks from the File menu or with Control+Shift+N. If you want to open a new tab, you can select that option in the Files menu or use Control+T. Call the new task whatever fits your style. I like being able to organize and display as a group all the tabs associated with a work project or a specific portion of my research. I can recall the entire list at any time to easily and quickly find where I was in my browsing adventure. Another neat feature is found under the paragraph alignment icon in the tab area. Click it to enable Reading Mode. This mode saves the article for future reference and strips away everything on the page so you can focus on the task of reading. Not Perfect The Min browser is not a perfect alternative to high-powered, feature-bloated alternatives. It does have a few glaring weaknesses that developers have taken too long to rectify. For instance, It lacks a solid developer website stocked with support forums and detailed user guides. That may be partly due to its home being GitHub rather than an independent developer website. Still, it's a weakness that is glaring to new users. Without website support, users are forced to struggle with lists of readme files and hard-to-follow directories on GitHub. You can access them from the Min browser Help menu -- but that's not much help. A case in point is the Welcome to Min splash screen that loads from the menu when you launch the browser. It displays two buttons. One says "Start Browsing." The other says "Take a Tour." Neither one works. However, you can start browsing by clicking on the menu bar at the top of the Min window. There is no workaround for the missing tour, though. Bottom Line Min is not a full-featured Web browser with bells and whistles galore. It is not designed for add-ons and many other features you typically use in well-established Web browsers. However, Min serves an important niche purpose by offering speed and distraction-free browsing. The more I use the Min browser, the more productive it is for me -- but be wary when you first start to use it. Min is not complicated or confusing -- it is just quirky. You have to play around with it to discover how it works. Want to Suggest a Review? Is there a Linux software application or distro you'd like to suggest for review?

Haier is focused on its international footprint whereas we are focused on North America right now so they chose to use another solution. Haier Roku TVs will continue to be available in the near-term. We will continue to support Haier Roku TVs and they will continue to get SW updates for the foreseeable future.”   Haier started to sell Roku-powered TVs in 2015.   Despite the loss of Haier, Roku said its TV integration business remains strong. Last week, it announced Element Electronics as a Roku TV partner, and said Roku TVs now account for 13% of all U.S. smart TV sales.   Roku’s other TV partners include Hitachi America, Sharp, Insignia (Best Buy’s in-house brand), and Hisense.  Want to read more stories like this?

The company says Atom leverages Google Maps and location services technology as well as the Google Cloud platform and machine learning services. Combined, these platform technologies help fleet supervisors and dispatchers make smart, real-time decisions on things like scheduling, routing, and asset viability. Patrick Skoglund, the Geo Lead at SADA Systems, describes Atom as a “very large, configurable application” with desktop, tablet and mobile components. Atom is easy to implement, he said, since it is compatible with fleets’ existing hardware and software. Fleets can also upload their databases into Atom, in any format, for work orders, inventory, customer locations, equipment specifications, routing restrictions and more. The machine learning services of Google Cloud mean Atom is “constantly learning” from information it receives. The platform is able to optimally route vehicles and work orders, he said, and to aggregate data on assets and resources with analytics and reporting tools. The platform includes a mobile app that drivers use to receive work orders with turn-by-turn navigation. In addition to being used commercial and private fleets, Atom is configurable for city and state transportation departments that are charged with overseeing and maintaining regional assets from vehicles to bridges, signs and walkways. Some of the primary components of the Atom application are: Inventory – An Inventory portal allows users to view items associated with their inventories with customizable lists and filtering. Its tools also help rank critical groups of inventory against the scheduling and deployment of workers for creation, inspection or maintenance of assets. Maps – A Maps portal has layers that can be controlled with a click or a tap to the screen for easy management of inventory and teams. Time management features native to Google Maps help with time management and show the impact of weather and traffic on field activities. Work Order – A Work Order portal creates transparency through the lifecycle of a project by managing work orders and tasks assigned to individuals or teams. Analytics – An Analytics portal makes it possible to view data across multiple platforms in a single display with metric-driven tools and visualizations. Schedule – A Schedule portal offers optimization for route management decisions to reduce idle time of people, equipment and vehicles. Teams – The Teams portal of Atom displays filtered information regarding employees, including their associated activities, teams, divisions, status and other background information. 0 comments   Get Livefyre FAQ Sign in + Follow Post comment   Link Newest | Oldest Aaron Huff Aaron Huff is the Senior Editor of Commercial Carrier Journal.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Paid Search Content Marketing Social Media SEJ SUMMIT Tools Advertise 10 Ways to Get Ready for Google’s Mobile Interstitials Penalty on January 10th News· SEO· Mobile Search January 9, 2017 Mobile Search News SEO Matt SouthernJanuary 9, 2017 SEJ STAFF 2.3KSHARES 24.0KREADS 2.3KSHARES 24.0KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 2.3KSHARES 24.0KREADS Google announced back in August 2016 that it will begin to devalue web pages in mobile search with intrusive interstitials as of January 10, 2017. Going forward, Google recommends using interstitials on mobile pages that only take up a “reasonable” amount of screen space. Here is an example of what Google considers to be “intrusive”: Google gave site owners plenty of time to prepare for the update, but in case you have not yet done so, I have rounded up 10 pieces of expert advice that will ensure your web pages are not affected by this penalty. How to Avoid Google’s Mobile Interstitials Penalty Advice from Google The first piece of advice comes from none other than Google itself. Here’s how Google defines the penalty: “To improve the mobile search experience, after January 10, 2017, pages where content is not easily accessible to a user on the transition from the mobile search results may not rank as highly.” Takeaway: Content on the pages you have indexed in mobile search must be readily available when a user clicks through to the page from Google. Be Honest With Yourself: Do Your Pop-Ups Serve a Purpose? Ben Silverman from Brafton Marketing shares this advice: “The easiest way to avoid the mobile interstitial and pop-up penalty is to think like Google, whose main objective is to make the internet more accessible, browsable, intuitive and honest, especially for mobile browsers. This means there are some exceptions to Google’s pop-up policy: If yours serves a real, honest purpose, chances are you’ll be okay.” Takeaway: Some pop-ups are still acceptable if they are either required by law, such as age verification, or if they don’t detract from the main content on the page, such as a small banner at the top. Hiding Content With Ads is Now Against Google Guidelines The Verge shares this advice: “For the most part, Google is targeting overlays that gray out the content beneath them to prevent you from reading a website, either for a few seconds or until you find and very carefully tap a little X to dismiss them.” Takeaway: Publishers may not be happy about this, but ads that are displayed over top of the main content are no longer acceptable. This includes ads that appear when you land on a page, as well as ads that appear as you scroll down a page. There should be no barrier preventing a user from reading content on the page at any time. Ad Publishers Need to Adapt and Look Into New Strategies HubSpot’s Senior Product Marketing Manager, Marcus Andrews, shares this advice: “…if they haven’t done so already, marketers solve for mobile SEO first. The pain that comes with changing a revenue model is inevitable, but shorter-term – and businesses that rely on advertiser dollars, should figure out ways to make money that don’t totally disrupt the mobile user experience.” Takeaway: Removing revenue-generating interstitials might hurt at first, but losing organic search traffic could hurt even more. Therefore, site owners must adapt and look for non-intrusive ways to generate revenue. Develop a Content Marketing Strategy for Generating Revenue Sitepoint shares this advice: “The consistent creation and distribution of relevant content attracts users without beating them with a hard-sell stick. Use content—including blog posts, round-ups, guides, videos, infographics, and more—to educate audiences and guide them through the buying process.” Takeaway: Since the goal of Google’s interstitials penalty is to make content more accessible, use that to your advantage. Develop a content marketing strategy to sell users on your products and services, rather than intrusive pop-up ads. Mobile-Friendly Label is Being Removed for All Sites, But Being Mobile-Friendly Still Matters Syed Balkhi of OptinMonster shares this advice: “The first part of the announcement that a lot of journalists skipped over is that the “mobile-friendly” label that Google is currently displaying in search results will be removed for everyone on January 10, 2017… Since over 85% of all pages in mobile search results now meet the criteria, they will be removing the label for everyone.” Takeaway: Google will no longer consider pages with intrusive interstitials as being mobile-friendly, but don’t panic once you don’t see the “mobile-friendly” label next to your content in search results. The label is being removed for everyone, although being mobile friendly is still as important as it has ever been. Intrusive Interstitials Not Allowed on Mobile, But Desktop is Still OK Icegram shares this advice: “Use display targeting rules in your popup / interstitial program, and show them only on desktop / larger screens. Don’t use popups and interstitials on mobile. Instead use smaller messages like banners, inlines or slide ins.” Takeaway: You don’t have to remove intrusive pop-up ads and interstitials altogether, you only need to remove them on mobile pages. They can still be displayed on desktop browsers without incurring any kind of penalty. Check Your WordPress Plugins Sarah Gooding of WP Tavern shares this advice: “WordPress users who use plugins to display pop up messages, whether it’s for coupons, membership offers, promotions, or another form of advertising, will want to carefully review Google’s size guidelines or consider a different approach for reaching visitors.” Takeaway: If you use WordPress plugins to display interstitials, staying in compliance with Google’s new guidelines may be as simple as adjusting sizes using the plugin settings. Remember, keep them small and non-obtrusive. Content should be the main focus of the page. Interstitials Triggered by Exit Intent Are Still Allowed Google’s John Mueller shared this advice when asked if the penalty would apply to pages with an interstitial triggered on exit intent: “At the moment those wouldn’t count. What we’re looking for is really interstitials that show up on the interaction between the search click and going through the page and seeing the content. So that’s kind of the the place we’re looking for those interstitials. What you do afterwards, like if someone clicks on stuff within your website or closes the tab or something like that then that’s kind of between you and the user.” Takeaway: Interstitials triggered by exit intent are perfectly fine. Google is only targeting interstitials that appear when a user lands on a page. Page-to-Page Interstitials Will Not Be Penalized Google’s John Mueller again shared his advice when asked if the penalty only applies to pages that users land on from Google’s search results: @schachin @methode yes — John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) January 4, 2017 Takeaway: Google is not looking to penalize all pages with interstitials, only the ones which searchers can land on from search results. It’s still OK to display an interstitial when a user navigates from one of your pages to another. Conclusion Google is always looking for new ways to improve the search experience. The intent behind devaluing pages with intrusive interstitials is to help users find the content they need without being bombarded by pop-ups. There’s no doubt this will require a period of adjustment for site owners who have been displaying interstitials up until this point, but in the end it could lead to more time on site, more pageviews per visit, and a lower bounce rate. There are both positive and negative aspects to this update — site owners just have to keep rolling with Google’s proverbial punches. For more information, I recommend listening to SEJ’s recent Marketing Nerds podcast where SEJ Executive Editor Kelsey Jones sits down with Simon Schnieders and Edward Kreiman from Blue Array to talk about the upcoming mobile interstitials penalty in detail.

Some doodles include games or an informative piece about the person or holiday they're celebrating. Now, Google can give you a notification whenever there's a cool new one. The notifications are mercifully opt-in, so you don't have to ruin your productivity the next time Google wants to celebrate PAC-MAN. However, if you're interested in them, you can enable notifications by following these steps: Open the Google app or swipe to the Google Feed portion of your home screen. Slide out the left-hand navigation panel. Tap Settings. Tap Notifications. Enable the Doodles toggle. After this, you'll get a notification from the Google app whenever there's a new interactive doodle. Presumably this won't bother you when the doodle is just a piece of artwork over the Google logo, but you'll be notified of anything special. Google now allows users to opt into receiving notifications when a new Doodle is posted [Android Police] Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Google’s Tango platform is an augmented reality that technology that uses computer vision to make mobile devices location-aware. The augmented reality from the tech giant does not rely on external systems, such as GPS, Wi-Fi, or sensors. “With Tango’s location and augmented reality (AR) capabilities, you’ll soon be able to experience museums around the world in a whole new way—starting with the Detroit Institute of Arts. In partnership with GuidiGO, the Detroit Institute of Arts has built Lumin, a mobile tour that uses Tango capabilities to add AR interactivity and information to further enrich your visit,” says Justin Quimby, Senior Product Manager, Tango in a blog post on Monday. Visitors to the Detroit Institute of Arts will be able to harness the rich potentials of the augmented reality of Google Tango. Though, there aren’t many devices in the market that support Tango, visitors will however, be able to borrow a Lenovo Phab 2 Pro [one of few devices that support Tango] from the museum’s front desk. This will enable them explore exhibits including ancient Egyptian mummies by simply using an AR overlay to earn an X-ray view of within the sarcophagi.

Still, display signs and audio guides can only convey so much. What if you could explore museums in a different way?” You may have read much about the famous Egyptian mummies, but Tango is given you a rear opportunity to experience it when you visit museums. With the app’s overlay, you can peer beneath the sarcophagus and even the mummies’ bandages to explore an X-ray-like view of the skeleton. Credit: https://blog.google/products/google-vr/explore-museums-new-way-tango/ Also available is the Ishtar Gate-ancient Babylonia; and Tango will enable you to visualize the gate at scale and see where the Detroit Institute of Art’s 3×4-foot mosaic piece fits into this architectural wonder. This will be made possible through the app’s motion tracking technology. Cylinder Seal; once used to make impressions on clay for items like jewelry and signatures for administrative purposes. Google Tango will enable you to roll the seals in AR to see the written characters and figurative scenes that they create instead of just seeing the seals in a case. Google has promised to bring Tango to more museums; and the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) is just the first of many.

(Updated) Oh boy, are we about to be treated to a new Google Voice? Maybe! A handful of Google Voice users (including me) are seeing a new banner at the top of our Voice accounts on the web that reads, “The new Google Voice is here.” That note is followed up with a link to “TRY NOW.”  At this point, clicking the “TRY NOW” link only refreshes the page and returns us all to the same spot in the current UI. In other words, we aren’t seeing a new Google Voice, possibly because Google has yet to flip the switch on a new UI or experience. We don’t know for sure, though, but this banner is most certainly new. It has been years since Google Voice received a major update, so assuming Google plans to keep it around for a while, a major update is probably needed. The Android app experience is quite awful, to put it lightly. And after all, now that Google has backed further and further away from Hangouts, you have to wonder if Google Voice is about to see a refresh that pulls it back into its own world. We’ll update you as we see or learn more. UPDATE: Google has confirmed to The Verge that updates to Google Voice are coming. With that said, they didn’t put any sort of timeframe on releasing those updates, only stating that they would share the goodies with us “as soon as [they] can.” Post navigation Previous StoryMoto G5 Plus Appears to Have Just Leaked in Full Next StoryDEAL: Samsung Fast Wireless Charging Stand is Just $24.99 Learjet This makes me happy. After Gmail and calendar, Voice is my most used Google product. I’ve been waiting (and expecting) to read about a kill-off, so I am pleasantly surprised. Tom Z I had the link yesterday… It’s no longer at the top of my screen. Bill Gates One more reason to LOVE iOS. Google ran by a lots of kids happy to know how to CODE and creating new apps and then rework old apps that no one uses. iMessage boy I love you! alexus oh man, I cannot wait!!! hopefully better (more up to date app with wear support) Dylan I had switched over to using Hangouts to check my Voice VM back when I thought Hangouts was going to be THE all-in-one messing client. It has that annoying issue where if a phone number is formatted differently than is being displayed in hangouts, it’s not smart enough to associate it with a contact ie) Hangouts having a message from (234) 567-8901 but the contact being prefixed with +1. I don’t know why assumed it was Voice issue and that it would be fixed in the future. This post reminded me of that annoyance. But it turns out it’s just a Hangouts issue after all! Opened up Voice for the first time in years only to find it listed out contacts just fine. Come on Google! Get it together! mlm5em I love Google Voice and Project Fi SMS from computer. Give me a website/app for these things and I could care less what happens to hangouts. Chris_K Google Voice, Google Plus, Hangouts, Allo, Duo, Messenger—–>One gigantic MESS. Cleanup your act google. warsaw I would love the ability to just erase my recorded name and use the standard greeting again. kirko77 I place my bet that we’ll be disappointed. Google hasn’t released any awesome “communication related” app updates or new apps since the original Hangouts. LionStone “At the Google Horizon event in September 2016, we previewed a new experience for Hangouts focused on meetings. In order to streamline our efforts further, we will be retiring the Google+ Hangouts API that enables developers to build apps for the older version of Hangouts video calls. This API was originally intended to support social scenarios for consumer users as part of Google+, whereas Hangouts is now turning to focus on enterprise use cases.”-Google http://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-acquires-Swedish-company-Limes-Audio-in-a-bid-improve-audio-quality-for-conference-calls_id89701 Colin Zack This is completely random, but I’m hoping someone might be able to help. My mom and I both used Google Voice in the past, but for some time now (maybe about a month?) voicemails don’t seem to go through to it and can’t be accessed. I get the Verizon voicemail notification at the top when GV is turned on and nothing on GV. Tried getting rid of it and re-adding it, reinstalling the app, and setting it back up, and calling Verizon to make sure our voicemail settings haven’t changed, but nothing. We only use it for voicemail. Anyone had this happen? gpzbc I experienced something similar. I think I had to go to the Verizon website and disable HD Voice and/or the Advanced Calling feature. I can’t remember exactly how to do it but Google should be able to tell you. Colin Zack I do remember turning on HD voice/advanced calling and WiFi calling. Does that mean I can’t have those with GV? That would suck. So you think I should get on with Google Support? gpzbc If I recall, I had to disable call forwarding to GV, then call Verizon and have them disable HD voice/advanced calling on my account, thenre-set-up GV on my phone. So yes, I don’t think HD voice/advanced calling and GV are compatible. bulldoggolfer74 Deactivate call forwarding and reactivate. Worked for me. Casey Voicemail started working on my 6P with 7.1.1 on Verizon in the stock dialer. I assume this fix also happened for the 5X. Is this your case? You might not need to use GV any longer, unless you want to. Colin Zack We want to use it, but apparently it looks like HD calling and some other advanced Verizon features won’t work with it digitalicecream that t-mobile DIGITS is starting to get the attention of Google. iCoerce Hangouts API is being killed. Google voice is seeing update… Google is pushing development of Allo, they have already stated that allo and Duo will eventually merge… SMS with Allo is a no brainer…So eventually Google voice can and will merge with Allo and SMS and it can be a one stop shop app. Especially with Google fi? Armorthane If you think the Android app is bad, try using the iOS version. Total joke. I swear Google is just messing with Apple when they wrote this app. LaFave07 Nice. I give out my Google Voice number to everything/everyone who is not family or friends. Basically my spam box for phone calls. I get emailed if I get a voicemail, but other than that I don’t get bothered from it. Indianajonze i just want to know how you all discovered it. i haven’t been to that site in probably a year LionStone For myself, I only would need to go to the website to tweak any settings or set up a new device. Since I use Hangouts for my messaging and to get my VM, I don’t need to use the GV app to get my VM. Ryan Probably going to be a completely new service you have to sign up for that has a new name but half the features of Voice. friguy3 Oh great, maybe they can make me switch apps yet again! So how many messaging/calling apps do they have….four now? They cant even kill off an app, they just, kinda stop supporting it, till they bring IT BACK TO LIFE!!! MadJoe The link was there, now it’s gone. A M The banner was showing up for me but disappeared now. Nayners Ha! I JUST moved away from Google Voice because of the crappy app and sub-par Hangout integration. Figures this would happen, after waiting years for improvements. We’ll see what we get! kirko77 1. What exactly do you use the app for? It’s only required to configure your phone for outgoing calls.. literally just one check box. 2. Hangouts integration actually surprisingly good. You get voice mail and can make Wi-Fi calls Nayners You’re talking to me like I haven’t used Google Voice for the last 6+ years. Everyone has different uses. I’m quite aware of the services strengths and weaknesses. kirko77 Sure, But you complained without explaining and still haven’t explained with second post. CabbageHeadCat. Pretty sure iost Google voice when I switched that number to hangouts. Hevent really looked though. Jellybelly Bean I’m an Android user for years, but have no idea what Google Voice is?? Can someone explain it to me? Kellex B You sign-up for a GV number, and then filter all your other numbers under it. Let’s say you have work and personal and home numbers. You attach all of them to your GV number, and then give everyone you want to contact you, your GV number. Then, whenever anyone calls, you, it rings through to all of your different phones. Also, you get visual voicemail, free SMS, and some other options, like cheap international calling, an internet UI to place calls, check SMS and email, etc. Brent S. I sure hope they don’t do like Inbox and the new G+ interfaces, and strip tons of features just to make it look simpler and prettier. helpful55 I usually react to this kind of thing with dread. I find something I like and even if not perfect get it set up for me. Then the next thing you know the geeks that are enthralled with playing with themselves make a mess out of it all. I’m hoping, but we’ll see. Grits n Gravy Google just rick rolled everyone, and it’s not even April Fool’s AndrewScottRox I’d be ok with this being a SMS app/platform. Dingus234 While they’re at it, Gmail and Calendar could use a major UI facelift too. Kevin N Hmm we have seen this before lol Daniel M. On iOS first…….. Hhotelconsult I am seeing it. What is so odd, is that Google heard me. My partners and I finally realized there’s way too many forms of comm, and email is certainly not working for me as it should. I committed to GVoice prior to it existing, as Grand Central. Now I am down to fewer phone numbers, and I really just need MMS, group texting, and simplicity as it seems my integration into voice and hangouts is a pain in the rear for my partners… namely because stuff just keeps switching around. I was LITERALLY telling them I was dumping GVoice, probably today, and then WHAMMO…. this. OH GOOGLE. I wish I could complain about seemingly free services (other than the data exhaust worth gold)….. but hopefully this is the resolution we were looking for. Kellex B Seeing the link or a new GVoice? Brian Ward I would be happy with just a ‘mark all as read’ button. Hhotelconsult How many times have you gone down that rabbit hole, hunting for the one SMS or Voicemail. So funny. Me too. Brian Ward I have Firefox installed for the sole purpose of running imacros to programmatically mark all messages read. 🙂 Also, nothing quick like calling to listin to messages and being greeted with ‘you have 127 new messages’. And then have it start playing from the oldest to newest. Meanwhile, I got the gist from the transcriptions 3 months ago. Hayden7200 You can basically already do this can’t you? Just check the box to show Unread instead of All and then check the box to select all messages and under Actions select Mark As Read. Brian Ward Only 10 messages at a time. Brian Ward And that includes missed calls and texts. If you are a heavy user the number rises very fast to where you could sit there for 15 minutes doing what you are saying. Lynn Savage But you still have to go page by page. I have over 500 unread VMs because I read the transcripts instead. Mark All Read is so tedious and annoying… Lynn Savage That would be perfect! I disabled showing VM in call log because every time I make/receive a call, my VM alerts go crazy with all my old, unchecked GVoice mails… MHD I have it too. Doesn’t do anything. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a0fc0cbd316f8e233d61ce099541f449168f2a4957c6de2248894d334bf43e4a.png Cnote11 Bless your hearts. I respect that your hope springs eternal. I, for one, have grown too cynical. Bob Zanis Looking forward to the changes! whatever I am pretty sure by redirecting us to the same page, someone at google is having a laugh, trolling us for the application we most want to see updated. Tomorrow that Try Now page will redirect GV to a EOL/Discontinued page… John Blount Just re-directed me to Project Fi page. jonzey231 Hmmm… Patrick Ryan My Google Voice number has been the only one I’ve used for 5 or 6 years. There is much to like it usually works. Hope they don’t screw this up. Fingers crossed. p0k3y Yeah, maybe it’s best they don’t try anything “new”, which usually means taking away something useful nowadays in Googland. Gonzales I’ve used GV when it was originally Grand Central. Firelight Majorly heavy Voice user here and I do *not* see it. Ugh! At least they aren’t killing it off. Can NOT live without it. Been using it since the Grand Central days. Kellex B We first got tipped to the new banner an hour or so ago, and none of us were seeing it. Now the banner is there. Refresh not working though! Something is happening…stupidly excited hah. JenningsChrist I’m a big Google voice user. Hadn’t logged into the web interface in forever! I’m seeing the link right now, just refreshes the page as you said. It’s about time for an update, I thought GV was dead for sure. Firelight I wonder if it’s because I turned off Hangouts for Voice and use it natively with Google Messenger? Dee Mann What do you mean you use it natively with Google messenger? Firelight I turned off Google Hangouts. GV then automatically creates a unique “new” number for each contact (like 916-###-#### when my home area code is 252) and then I assigned that to the proper contact and presto-chango it’s native text messaging. Except MMS. Lynn Savage That unique new number thing is why I stopped using the GV apps. I never understood why that was necessary. I’ve been using Hangouts axclusovely for messaging for a few years now, and setting my phone up so my native dialer calls thru my GV number. Dee Mann What do you mean using natively with Google messenger? soccerburn55 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3827ee3b5f13e11b06b610fc48bbf0f10459052a7e7d43fa09812b8f7f0413cf.gif Nathan Patel I use this and the old Google voice app daily. A UI refresh would be amazingggg mcdonsco Please be a new app too! Tired of tapping play 3-4 times on every voicemail to get them to play! Kellex B The GV app is quite possibly the biggest piece of 2010 garbage I have to use still to this day. Firelight I made GV the native VM app for my Nexus 5x and that doesn’t happen when integrated with the dialer’s VM functions. But yes, that darned GV app is shite. mcdonsco I’ve tried integrating it into the dialer many times and it never works for me. Tried on a nexus, moto, Sammy phones and my current OP3T. VM will show in the dialer but won’t play. mlm5em Can’t you play and read transcribed messages in the Phone app and also Hangouts? Or is this Project Fi only? C Shwizzel Yes Hangouts. Not sure why anyone would still use the GV app. It’s a disgrace to Google and Android. Cole Gerdemann I don’t see the Google voice options in hangouts and so I’m forced to use the voice app 🙁 Sean Lally Wouldn’t it be cool if Google would pick a direction and stick with it? Kellex B Hah right Justin Bontrager https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/support-faq Snow02 Link not working. Wade Ivy Mmm. Exciting. Hurtsdonut or left, either direction will do. Robbie Gerling 3 weeks ago, I ported out of Google Voice after almost 8 years of service… I honestly wish I had done it sooner. The one thing I liked the most was voicemail transcription and sending to my gmail as an attachment. Now, on AT&T prepaid, I have visual voicemail and can text from my computer(s) using PushBullet. Pedro Isn’t that exactly what they’ve done with Voice for the 5 years? Minor update last April. Last update before then?? Sean Lally Voice has felt for a long time like they were about to bail on it. If you go to the Voice website now (as a non subscriber) it redirects to Project Fi. I was on Voice, but ported my number to Fi awhile ago… Kellex One more reason to LOVE iOS. Google ran by a lots of kids happy to know how to CODE and creating new apps and then rework old apps that no one uses. iMessage boy I love you!!! Sean Lally What? michael arazan I usually never condone precription psychiatric medication except in extreme situations, but Google really needs some Ritalin to stay focused Ryan Weber This makes me so happy! I was worried with google rolling back hangouts that GV might go the same route, but this is really encouraging. I’m seeing the same banner on my page. Kellex B Because Hangouts has been thrown on the back burner, it almost makes sense for Voice to come back to the front as a stand-alone service, assuming Google intends to keep it around. Ryan Weber http://gph.is/1OQcJ2H Ryan Weber It’s about time… http://gph.is/1OQcJ2H Alexander I’m kinda hoping they move it into Google allow so that it functions like iMessage. If you message somebody that has allowed it sends an alloy message and if you message somebody that doesn’t have allowed it automatically sends from the Google voice number TheChocolateLady good. because i hate hangouts. cadtek91 I doubt that’s it’s any new features, more that likely it’s just a MD refresh. Derek L. Oh boy… I can’t wait to see them discontinue the service… Aaron Hurt I’m seeing it! But the link doesn’t work. I’m a heavy GVoice user. My phone defaults to that number… hopefully they don’t screw it up! Patriciashamilton Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !mj121d: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

(AAPL) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Should I Buy Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons View All Posts Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a stock that’s boring, until it’s not. In 2012, GOOG stock went up by single digits but then in 2013 it gained almost 60%. Then in 2014, what was then Google stock lost about 3% before gaining another 44% again in 2015 after changing its name to Alphabet along the way. Source: Travis Wise via Flickr In 2016, Alphabet Inc. was up by about 8% to lag the overall stock market. So will the past trend hold, and will 2017 be a breakout year? There are fair arguments on both sides. After all, the high-growth days of Google are behind it after the internet giant has matured to a nearly $600 billion company. Also, rival Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is now its peer in both its reach and its relationship with digital advertisers. On the other hand, bulls who like GOOG stock or GOOGL like its track record of consistent growth and innovation over the years. So who’s right? Here’s a look at both sides of the trade with three pros and three cons to investing in Alphabet stock right now. Pros of GOOG Stock Growth: While the company restructured into Alphabet in 2015, Google advertising remains the biggest part of its business. And that business is good, judging by overall revenue growth of 19% this year and a projected 16% growth rate next year. Furthermore, profits will be up 16% this year and 19% next year. With continued success from its core, Alphabet can afford to look into new efforts without worrying about financial performance. The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New Year Valuation: Despite a strong history of success and projections of future growth, GOOG stock is not overvalued. Right now, shares trade for around 20 times forward earnings. That is on par with forward P/E of about 19 for the typical stock in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. If you can get a fair price for a high-growth company like this, you should take it. Innovation: With a fair current price and hopes of future growth, there’s a lot to like about Alphabet Inc. right now. But with constant innovation into new areas, including a “smart” contact lens that can read your blood sugar or Google Fiber high-speed internet access, there is a whole lot of future potential from GOOG stock.

Answer by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, Consultant (tech hiring/interviewing), Author, Coder, on Quora: Is there a relationship between the result of a technical interview and the performance of the employee? I believe so, but it's a very hard thing to study. The Silly Google Study Google tried to study this, but the study was fundamentally flawed. What Google did was attempt to correlate interview scores with performance review score. Sounds fair, right? Not at all. There were more than a few flaws with this. First, the interview score does not totally represent your interview performance--ditto for your performance review score. The actual description profoundly influenced how the committee sees you. There is a strong correlation between how you performed and your score (hopefully), but it's not perfect. That will mask some of the correlation between interview scores and performance review ratings. Second, and more importantly, Google did not hire at random and then see how those people did. Of course not. No company wants to take that risk. Instead, they looked at those who got hired. To get hired, a candidate must perform very well. When my hiring committee voted to hire someone, they nearly all had an average score of between 3.1 and 3.3. So what Google concluded was that in this very high and very narrow band of scores, interview scores are not predictive of job performance scores. Gee, shocking. This is like wanting to study if athletic skill correlates with life expectancy (sounds plausible!). But, oops, the only data you have is that of Olympic medal winners. You don't find a correlation, therefore nothing. You can't conclude anything from that, other than that minor changes in phenomenal athletic skill don't correlate with a statistically significant longer life. So let's just dismiss this study... Why I Believe It Works There are two reasons I believe it works. First, virtually every top tech company has built their engineering teams with this process: Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Airbnb, etc. There are little deviations, and some companies do a better job with this process than others, but the types of questions are essentially the same. I am not saying: They're famous, so they must know what they are doing. No no. What I'm saying is that if it doesn't correlate reasonably with job performance, then you must believe that engineers hired at random could build systems of this complexity. I find this highly unlikely. Second, I do interview coaching for startups going through acquisitions. This method has allowed me to interview the same person several times and also talk to their manager about how they are doing. My perception of their strengths and weaknesses seems to match up reasonably well with their real strengths and weaknesses. When I say that someone is smart, they are--and this process does a reasonably good job at identifying that. What I mean by "works" It's not perfect by any means. There are also times when I have a sense that someone is bright (that is, they do have the skills that I'm trying to hire for), but they are so nervous that I can't get enough data to feel confident about hiring them. They get rejected, and that sucks. The existence of some false negatives and positives though does not mean a process is totally flawed. It's about whether it works overall, and I believe it does. What does/doesn't work: The technical interview process is designed to identify people who are smart and have the aptitude to become good coders. It also can somewhat evaluate a candidate's ability to work on a team, although many processes can identify that. It does not identify skill with a technology. If you want that, you'll need to add that in. It does not identify work ethic. Good luck finding a process that does. It is relatively efficient, scalable, and easy to implement. That matters too. Again, it is not perfect. But when implemented well, it's pretty good. Lots of companies, however, don't implement it well. They ask easy questions or common questions or just stupid questions. I've done lots of interviewer training. There are some interviewers who know what they're doing, and a whole lot who don't. This question originally appeared on Quora - the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. More questions: Job Interviews: If I was not asked to bring a CV, should I still bring it to the interview? Google: Would Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft be able to withstand a more than 1Tbps DDOS attack? Microsoft: I have a full-time offer from Microsoft and Facebook, and I'm currently an intern at Google. They gave me 4 days to decide. What should I do?

But competitors such as Google have assets that Amazon can't match. By Ross Rubin | January 9, 2017 -- 19:52 GMT (11:52 PST) | Topic: Innovation Ford cars will soon offer Alexa, but also competitive agents. Image: Ford Amazon's Alexa voice agent has been the biggest surprise hit for the mammoth online retailer since it moved into the cloud storage business with Amazon Web Services. Alexa showed up at CES 2017 in full force. As Larry Dignan notes, the agent picked up friends in high places, including Ford, Whirlpool, Dish Network, Huawei, Hyundai, Mattel, Lenovo, LG, Samsung and ADT. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage That shouldn't be a surprise to those who noted the rise of Alexa at CES 2016. The disembodied voice agent began its integration march with products from smaller companies and startups, including VoIP vendor Ooma, item finder vendor TrackR, and Bluetooth speaker/digital message board vendor Invoxia. And that was all before Alexa's strong year-end showing. Amazon's progress with Alexa has caused some to proclaim it the winner of the voice wars. Without question, the online retailer has grabbed an early lead in the voice agent space beyond smartphones although, as I mentioned in my column on Microsoft's 2017 priorities, some of this has been driven by necessity given Amazon's fiery failure in the smartphone space. Despite Amazon's early lead and aggressive integration, though, it's at a disadvantage when it comes to distribution, user experience and knowledge graph. Take cars, for example. Amazon may have announced a few automotive partners at CES. But both Apple and Google have struck integration deals with virtually every major car company that are putting Siri and Google Assistant on wheels. Or TV, where market leader Samsung will certainly prioritize its Viv-derived agent and Siri, Cortana and Google Assistant will find their way in via products such as Apple TV, Xbox One and Sony televisions. At CES, Google put the industry on notice that it intends to make up ground quickly in the voice agent race in 2017, using its massive investments in artificial intelligence to extend a better experience. Amazon may sell Go games, but Google has mastered them. Future versions of Google Assistant may not even need to hear what you're saying. Indeed, far from the argument that consumers' associations with Apple's and Google's smartphones will hinder their voice agents elsewhere, consumers are far more likely to want a familiar and seamless interface across smartphone, home devices and the car. The aggregate number of devices that have announced Amazon integration are a small fraction of the number of Android phones that use Google's suite of services and are primed to receive more exposure to Google Assistant as a natural part of the upgrade cycle. And while Alexa has been hailed as a harbinger of a post-app economy, there's great potential in integrating conversational interfaces for some tasks and screen interfaces for others. Here again, Amazon is far behind. Alexa is great for Amazon. It has allowed the company to make an end-run around the major smartphone OS platforms to sneak a portal for purchasing and content into emerging smart device classes. But AI-driven voice interfaces remain in their infancy. Amazon focuses on the long game, but its competitors are fueling up for a decades-long journey.

(Facebook/Dharavi Tours) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Machines with Brains January 09, 2017 Quartz india The Internet of Things (IoT) is coming to a 535-acre slum in the heart of Mumbai. Home to more than one million people, Dharavi is one of Asia’s largest slums. Shanty-homes line its narrow alleyways where open drains run along the ground and electric cables hang overhead. The slum’s manufacturing and retail ecosystem is worth more than $1 billion on its own. Residents work in a variety of industries—leather tannery, textiles, pottery, recycling—and Dharavi’s bustling market is a retail haven for savvy buyers of leather products, jewellery, furniture, textiles, and more. Now, vendors in this city-within-a-city are getting help from the IoT. Using 30 beacon devices provided by Google, a group of researchers from the Industrial Design Centre (IDC) at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, along with researchers from Swansea University in the UK, is creating a “physical web” connecting different shops in Dharavi’s markets. The initiative is part of the Google IoT Research Award Pilot, announced last February. Overall, Google has provided 100 beacon devices for the Dharavi project. Designed to allow any smart device to interact with real-world objects without having to download specific applications, Google’s Beacon platform lets retailers send timely alerts to nearby shoppers. The wall-mounted beacon can broadcast a web URL to anyone with a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone standing up to 30 feet away. Once a customer receives the notification and opens the link, he or she is taken to an interactive online marketplace that offers information on what vendors in the locality are selling. To make sure that prospective customers are aware of the program, shopkeepers have been provided with posters asking shoppers to turn on their Bluetooth. “Most people who might be passing by Dharavi’s leather market might not even know that these markets have such good-quality crafty products,” says Chinmay Parab, a master’s student at the IDC who worked on the project. “[This technology will give them] digital visibility.” With the first 30 beacons, researchers targeted Dharavi’s leather stores; for the remaining 70, they have their sights set on Kumbharwada, Dharavi’s potters’ colony, and garment vendors. Researchers will study the beacons for five weeks, though shopkeepers will be able to keep the devices even after the experiment is over. Once programmed, the devices can last for up to three years. Dharavi’s vendors are no strangers to technology: According to The Hindu newspaper, many are adept at video chat, Google voice search, and messaging tools like WhatsApp. But some remain wary of the beacons, only 11 of which have been adopted since installations began two weeks ago. “It is taking a bit more time than we expected to convince people, but we expected an inertia to [adopting] any new technology,” says Parab, adding that researchers are in talks with 19 more shops about participating in the project. Some store owners say they are satisfied with their loyal customer base, although those aware of growing competition from Amazon, Flipkart, and Snapdeal are more likely to experiment with the beacons. No matter how technologically advanced they become, Dharavi’s market remains an informal one. The government has repeatedly threatened to upend the area’s unregistered businesses and develop residential and commercial skyscrapers on the land instead. Parab hopes the beacon project might forestall such a result by changing the public’s perception of Dharavi. “The economy that runs in parallel in Dharavi is always ignored under this ‘Asia’s largest slum’ image that we all have,” he says. “We’re attempting to give Dharavi, even though on a small scale, a new identity of being a digital hub.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search
Monday, January 9, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Voice-Based Personal Assistants Spencer MacDonald: The Alexa app on iOS is clearly a hybrid app, in fact I would say it is predominately web based. There are a few strange behaviours with navigation (sometimes you press back and it appears to pop an entire web view from the navigation stack, thus you actually go back multiple steps) and it doesn’t use native controls which can be quite jarring at times. The app works, but I’m pleased that besides the initial configuration you don’t have to use it. It does have a nice feature where it shows you all the events you have triggered, and also (rather creepily) allows you to playback the audio from any of your requests that triggered Alexa, which is good for when you ask yourself “Why did it do that?”. […] Obvious I couldn’t review Alexa without making the comparison to the other assistant in my life, Siri. After living with the Echo for a few months, the detection and transcription capabilities of Alexa on the Echo is leaps and bounds ahead of Siri on the iPhone 7. Alexa is also better at answering general questions, like the weather, unit conversion etc. However I feel that Siri’s intents API implementation means that for the few supported domains (8 as of iOS 10), your interactions feel a lot more natural compared to when interacting with a Skill. In short they are both coming at the problem from different directions, Alexa is currently winning but in my opinion that has a lot to do with the hardware. Ben Thompson (Hacker News): In short, Amazon is building the operating system of the home — its name is Alexa — and it has all of the qualities of an operating system you might expect[…] […] That leaves the business model, and this is perhaps Amazon’s biggest advantage of all: Google doesn’t really have one for voice, and Apple is for now paying an iPhone and Apple Watch strategy tax; should it build a Siri-device in the future it will likely include a healthy significant profit margin. Amazon, meanwhile, doesn’t need to make a dime on Alexa, at least not directly: the vast majority of purchases are initiated at home; today that may mean creating a shopping list, but in the future it will mean ordering things for delivery, and for Prime customers the future is already here. Alexa just makes it that much easier, furthering Amazon’s goal of being the logistics provider — and tax collector — for basically everyone and everything. Dan Moren: As a happy Amazon Echo user for nearly two years now, you might think I wouldn’t be in the market for any other voice-controlled virtual assistant—and you’d be wrong. Dead wrong. Upon returning home from my lengthy trip last month, one of the boxes awaiting me contained a Google Home that I’d ordered while abroad. […] The other big comparison point against the Echo is sound quality. I don’t pretend to have an audiophile’s ear, but to me the Google Home sounded like it had a little more bass than the Echo but an overall muddier sound. While it’s definitely superior to the Echo Dot—low bar there—it’s certainly not too hard to find a better-sounding speaker than pretty much anything in this class. […] In any case, voice recognition and synthesis are table stakes for these devices. The real question is whether or not the Google Home has any functionality so compelling that I’ll switch to using it over my Echo. The answer to that, so far, is…not really. Khoi Vinh: Alexa is clearly able to understand your commands—and act on them—better than Siri is able to, but it doesn’t feel leagues better. In practice, it’s not uncommon to have to issue commands three, four, five or more times before Alexa understands what you’re trying to say—or until you learn the way Alexa wants you to say it. […] At home we also received an Echo Dot as a present, a product which I think could be a home run. For just US$50, you get everything that the Echo does except for the higher quality speaker (which means Amazon is basically charging you US$130 for the full fledged version’s speaker, when you think about it). At that price point, I could easily imagine having a Dot in each room of the house, which would make for a really powerful system. […] And finally, design. The Google Home comes in a nicer package, is a much nicer form factor, and is just gorgeous. It’s a very handsome expression of impressive technology Colin Cornaby: Still finding that Alexa/Echo is horrible for home automation compared to Siri. Rare bright spot for Apple. Stephen Hackett: [Echo is] an open platform, meaning developers can write applications — dubbed Skills — that users can enable with just a tap in the Alexa mobile app. […] HomeKit, on the other hand, is a closed system. Apple has a rigorous approval process before allowing a device or service to be listed as a supported partner. From a security standpoint, this is a big win. rblatz: People are all up in arms about headphone jacks, USB-C, and dongles. When the real issue is Apple completely missing huge new markets. Apple had Siri out and was in the lead with voice control, then they wasted it. I never use Siri, she is nearly worthless, but I do use Alexa multiple times a day. Amazon is Leading the voice assistant market, and Google is right on their heels. Home automation was supposed to get better with HomeKit but arrived basically stalled. They announced all these partners and sold their products at the Apple Store. Then when HomeKit finally was ready none of those products worked with HomeKit. Steven Levy (via Dan Moren): “That’s really important,” Schiller says, “and I’m so glad the team years ago set out to create Siri — I think we do more with that conversational interface that anyone else. Personally, I still think the best intelligent assistant is the one that’s with you all the time. Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” Madison Margolin: Gatebox is new holographic home assistant that’s similar to the Amazon Echo’s Alexa, only more anthropomorphic—and creepier. Made by the Japanese company Vinclu Inc, the device is a transparent, voice-activated cylinder that displays a tiny holographic character named Azuma Hikari (presumably, other characters can be added later). […] It seems designed specifically to appeal to lonely bachelors. See also: Accidental Tech Podcast, The Talk Show. Previously: Developing for the Amazon Echo, SiriKit.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Telegram encrypted messaging app adds ‘Unsend’ button 06 Jan 2017 5 Mobile, Privacy, Security threats Post navigation Previous: Schools hit by spate of cold call ransomware attacks Next: FBI refutes DNC claims about not investigating servers by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Happy New Year! Welcome to another “Unsend” button! The story goes like this: a certain engineer was so revved about the new year, he sent his mom an SMS sticker depicting a scruffy Santa saying “Screw you” to its recipients. Is the profane Santa an Unsend creation myth? Who can say? The tale is sure believable, given the missteps we’ve probably all made with e-chatting. Or, as his employer, encrypted messaging app Telegram, puts it… Take that, Friday nights! At any rate, there is no hangover large enough to justify telling Mom to go screw herself. So the engineer quickly whipped up a way to kill recently sent messages and save his bacon. And as of the recently released v.3.16, all Telegram users are now able to do the same. You know that Unsend button: it used to be the joke you played on the technically clueless when they flew out of their offices, bug-eyed, asking everybody to delete the email they mistakenly, unadvisedly sent to the whole company. Google made it real, more or less, with the undo send option it first offered in 2009, buried as it was under an “experimental” warning. Google pulled the Unsend button into the daylight to promote with a bit more gusto in June 2015. Google gave you a frantic, fumbling 30 seconds to lunge for that button. Yahoo Messenger last year gave you the ability to reach into years worth of outbox muck to delete any message sent to any user at any time, making it disappear from the recipient’s inbox. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Telegram’s promising something in between: it’s giving you 48 hours to un-embarrass yourself, it said on Tuesday. But. With so-called but often so-not-really disappearing messaging promises, there’s always a but. The notion that messages and images are ephemeral and will disappear forever has been flawed from the start – recipients can always grab screenshots or simply take photos of their screens. Even if they don’t, we found that with Snapchat, the supposedly disappearing images stayed right on senders’ phones and often hung around on Snapchat’s servers. Regarding Yahoo’s wiping a given message from its servers and deleting it from a recipient’s phone, it followed Viber on that path. Viber in October 2015 began to offer unsend, including messages, photos or GIFs, from recipients’ devices. Oh, boy, many of us thought: any message, from any device, as Viber enthused? Um, no, it said a few days later: Windows phones not included. So yes, deleting messages has been a bit of a shaky proposition. Messages have a way of lingering, be they in image form as screenshots, printed out or copied before a sender deletes them from a recipient’s inbox, stuck in servers’ innards, or having the poor judgment to pop up on the wrong kind of phone. And that’s not all – Telegram has also had its share of security issues. It was in headlines over security twice in one week in August. Once for a data leak in its MacOS version, from which any cut-and-pasted text wound up in the system log. System logs hang around for days and in corporate environments might even be sent unencrypted to a logging server. As Naked Security’s Mark Stockley said about the vulnerability, it was the kind of thing that can happen when somebody makes a mistake like leaving a bit of debugging code in a production app. That was followed by an SMS text vulnerability that led to account compromise of Iranian journalists, activists and others in sensitive positions. There’s screw-you Santas, and then there’s the need to keep your encrypted messaging app away from the prying eyes of repressive regimes. Even super-secret-sauce software is still software, as Mark noted. It’s still made by people, used by people, and subject to flaws. The moral of the story: unsend features like Telegram’s are promising, but it’s safest to assume that messages aren’t necessarily going to blink out of existence.

Is it only possible to unsend messages that the recipient hasn’t seen yet? I think the Gmail version works well because it’s not really unsend at all – it cancels the send before it happens. When a service provides both sides of a communication system it seems like there’s a bit of a conflict of interest, since they effectivly act as an agent of both parties. I think they should be clear about which party has the authority to control which resource. I don’t want a third party reaching into my inbox to delete a message, even if they did send it. Reply Mahhn says: January 9, 2017 at 2:31 pm If the message displayed content from a portal, and that portal required a key that is part of the Email, and the sender had authority to Change said key, this could disable the message from being retrievable. But, if it get’s seen once…. This would be an easy service to set up. Reply dolores23 says: January 9, 2017 at 2:57 pm Since WhatsApp has introduced end-to-end encryption as standard, Telegram has become the least secure IM around. Sure, you still shouldn’t use WhatsApp (due to its’ exploitation of users’ metadata) but a messenger like Threema or Singal. I just wish sites like this one would stop promoting such a shady service like Telegram. Reply mantle says: January 9, 2017 at 5:27 pm Telegram blocked taking its screenshots.

While we do see a few phones announced here and there, as well as plenty of virtual reality stuff, CES isn’t quite what it once was the years we first started attending. In 2017, we saw a lot of the same, with US availability announcements for phones like the Mate 9 from Huawei, two new Chromebooks from Samsung and Google, plus a gang of other announcements that includes new Android Wear devices from an assortment of brands. With the following post, I intend on sharing my favorite announcement from this year’s CES and going over the product in full detail.  As you may have figured from the title of this post, NVIDIA’s new SHIELD Android TV console is my favorite announcement from CES 2017. In the weeks and days leading up to the show, we discussed publicly our desire for a new Android TV console from NVIDIA, given that both Kellen and I use a SHIELD in our homes on a daily basis. Not only does it offer Google’s Android TV operating system for access to games and apps like Netflix and YouTube, but for me, it offers another library of games for me to play thanks to GeForce NOW. Seriously, we love SHIELD and the fact that the rumors were true and NVIDIA announced a new one had us both pretty excited during NVIDIA’s keynote event. While the initial feedback I’ve seen on SHIELD (2017) is mixed, allow me to clear up any confusion regarding what NVIDIA is bringing to the table in the new year. For starters, the new SHIELD is smaller, and also feels quite a bit different from the OG model. While the original SHIELD is bit larger and metallic in appearance (it’s mainly heavy plastic), the new SHIELD is extremely lightweight, plastic, and more compact. This move should help save you some space on your TV stand or wherever else you intend on placing it. Not only is the console itself smaller, but the updated SHIELD Controller is also smaller, about 20% in total, according to one of NVIDIA’s reps that I spoke with. On top of the SHIELD Controller’s new design, having played a bit of Titanfall 2 and messing around with the new SHIELD’s UI, I can confirm that it feels much better as a gaming controller than the original SHIELD Controller. The grip on the updated controller feels much more ergonomic, hopefully leading to more hours of gaming without getting tired hands. For those who think the Controller’s design is pretty funky looking, don’t worry, I agree with you, but it feels great in-hand. Something also worth noting, while the SHIELD Controller is still charged via microUSB, the SHIELD Remote is no longer charged the same way. Instead of charging the remote via microUSB, it has a replaceable battery. While no one would label that as entirely awesome, NVIDIA claims that a fresh battery in the SHIELD Remote can last up to a year of usage. But still, an old school battery? Odd move from NVIDIA. Topping off the Controller and Remote’s new specs are IR blasters for usage with all of your other TV and media hardware. This is a feature that was lacking in the previous version of the Controller and Remote, so it’s a praised addition this year. Specs and Performance Back to the console’s innards, a few minor changes have been made, including one that left me a little disappointed in NVIDIA’s decision making, as well as one that may leave potential buyers disappointed. Inside, buyers will find the same Tegra X1 chip that is in the original, as well as 3GB RAM, but in NVIDIA’s testing, the set-top box will still outperform its competition quite easily (3x the performance). Is it an awesome move to present the same processor in this new hardware as the company did in the original? Not really, no, but NVIDIA doesn’t exactly have a new chip to toss in there. If NVIDIA did have updated silicon to slap inside of updated SHIELD hardware, they likely would have, but we may have also seen an increase in price. It’s sort of a take and give situation. With that said, though, performance should not be an issue when you go to stream your 1080p video games at 60fps. Everything should be smooth and sexy, at least from what we experienced during our time with the product demo. For a full list of specifications for the 16GB model and PRO model, check here. The storage is where NVIDIA changes things up from the original, deciding to strip the base 16GB model of a SD card slot, something that I don’t agree with. In what will likely be labeled as a way to keep the sizing down, only the PRO model of SHIELD (500GB) will come with a SD card slot, but that seems very unhelpful to those who possibly can’t afford the PRO. If users can only obtain a 16GB model, a SD card would have been helpful, but NVIDIA also clarifies that the use of a USB 3.0 storage device is still an option in case expandable storage is necessary for the user. The updated SHIELD will launch with Android 7.0 “Nougat,” which also includes a sweet new app switching UI. For current SHIELD owners, don’t worry, NVIDIA made it quite clear that most of the new features that were announced will also hit older consoles in the future. To be clear, NVIDIA will not be leaving you behind. Google Assistant and SPOT Another major change for the new SHIELD TV is future access to Google Assistant, the first time Google’s digital assistant will be brought to your living room’s television. With Assistant built-in, users can speak to either their SHIELD Remote or SHIELD Controller very naturally, asking for TV shows or movies to be found, accessing weather, or seeing photos from a previous trip you have taken. Thanks to the controller and remote having the ability to always listen, you won’t need to specifically press any buttons for Assistant to be prompted. You will simply speak the “Ok Google” hot word. Not only that, but even a feature not yet available for Google Home was showcased, which is the ability to have a natural conversation with Assistant. Instead of constantly speaking the hotword, you simply state any followup remarks/questions after Assistant delivers the initial results. For example, if you ask about new movies, you can followup with “only new ones,” or “only comedy.” No more “Ok Google” for each inquiry. For those worried about privacy surrounding the microphones always listening, that feature can be disabled from within the Settings menu, meaning the remote or controller aren’t always listening for you to speak the hot word. Sadly, Assistant and the aforementioned features won’t be available at launch of the new SHIELD, since Google has not yet made it public for Android TV. During our demo, we only used a beta build of the software. We don’t know when the feature will come, but it should be awesome. To go along with the new SHIELD and all of this Google Assistant functionality, NVIDIA announced the NVIDIA SPOT. With these little mic+speaker balls that plug directly into your wall’s power outlet, you can access Google Assistant from any room they are placed, with SHIELD TV handling the computing workload. Thanks to SmartThings integration via yet-to-be-launched dongle, SHIELD becomes a hub for all of your home’s smart stuff. For example, if you have Hue lights throughout the house, plus a few SPOTs, users can say, “Ok Google, turn off the bedroom lights,” with the action then going from your bedroom’s SPOT to your SHIELD, then dispatched to the room’s Hue lightbulbs via WiFi. While the process may sound complex, it’s relatively easy to setup and manage. In addition, should you have more SPOTs in the house, they become smarter with the ability to triangulate a user’s position. If the SHIELD can pinpoint where you are, it can become more aware, allowing you to speak less of a command. As an example, instead of asking for the Hue lights to be turned off in a particular room, SHIELD will recognize where you are, thanks to the triangulated position, then turn off the lights in just the room you are currently in. SPOT will also utilize the volume of your voice to recognize where in the house you are. So, instead of, “turn off bedroom lights,” it’s just, “turn off the lights.” Pretty sweet, right? Pricing The 16GB base model of SHIELD is priced at $199, but as a bonus, the SHIELD Remote is no longer an accessory and will be thrown in with the purchase of SHIELD TV. In the box, you will get SHIELD, a SHIELD Controller, plus a SHIELD Remote. The remote used to be a $50 add-on, so that’s a major bonus. For the PRO, the price is $299. It also comes with the same SHIELD Controller and SHIELD Remote, but also has the 500GB of built-in storage and SD slot. Essentially, it can be run as your ultimate gaming console and media server. Unlike companies that announce products and then hold off on launch, the new SHIELD TV is available for pre-order right now at a number of retailers with launch set for January 16. You can find it at Amazon, Newegg, and on NVIDIA’s website. The SPOT, however, is not yet ready for purchase and will be made available later this year for $50. Does that suck? Absolutely, but hey, it’s coming. If you have any questions regarding SHIELD, the controller, or anything else, I can do my best to answer them for you in the comments below. Until then, there you have it, my favorite product announcement from CES 2017. Post navigation Previous StoryGiveaway: Win 1 of 2 Huawei Mate 9 Phones We Got From CES Next StoryMoto G5 Plus Appears to Have Just Leaked in Full DarkBlueSky If you look at the Amazon Product Page for the new version of this. You will see the following line. This is on actual Amazon Page so it is the best confirmation that we will have Amazon Video in 4k HDR. Best for Amazon Prime – Watch Amazon Video in 4K HDR and get access to original shows like The Grand Tour, The Man in the High Castle, and much more. Michael Habel It was already a bonehead move to strip the 16Gb of its IR Receiver, but to also take the SD Card Slot as well?! Why would I buy the ’17 Model when I could probably pick up a neused One for a few bucks less, and keep both the IR Receiver, and the SD Slot? The only update(s) to this Shield TV Slim. Are the Gamepad, which basically striped away the defunct Touchpad… Well damn! So much for hoping they’d ever bring that back! And, the Remote with its non-rechargable Battery. Which now both have revamped Mics for Google’s Assistant, and the IR Blasters that probably No-one will ever use. At least not those with a decent Logitech Harmony Remote anyhow. TBH I was kinda worried about picking up a neused Shield TV Pro, earlier this Month. Knowing that the new One was Days away from it debut. As it turns out I had nothing much to fear at all. BTW nVIDA do have a newer SoC the Tegra P1 (Pascal Cores), which they could have simply dropped in the new Shield TV. I suspect the problem here though is Two-fold. One, they probably aren’t making enough of em to feed the need. Two, And the more likely story is they probably have an exclusivity contract with Nintendo for its Switch System. Which is why they just continued on using the X1, which is still decent enough. I suspect not upping the RAM which was something they could have at least done. Was to keep the overall codebase stable. And to prevent people from ending up bricking their Systems. Yazz96HD all I am saying its there is too many ads I can’t stand getting redirected to Apps store or play store I will use ad blocker PewPewYoureDead The article mentions using it as a media server. Does this mean I can put my media collection on a harddrive, put Plex on it and then stream from it without using my PC? Frank King Yes, but since Plex metadata just won’t go on external storage; (adopted or not) it will easily clog the 16gb model on-board storage. IMHO, the use of the Shield TV as a Plex media server is viable only with the Pro version. PewPewYoureDead Oh, damn. That’s good to know. Thanks! Frank King What’s more, since the transcoding operation of a large 1080p video requires at least 8-15gb of free internal (on-board or adopted) storage, adopting an external drive is mandatory (with the 16gb model). Might as well just go for the Pro model and forget about it. .. On the other hand, Flash storage will always be more reliable than an OG mechanical drive.. Decisions decisions… Prizm What the hell is Plex putting in the metadata folders? You’ll have some text, a poster, and a couple background images for movies, and maybe thumbnails for TV episodes. You’d be lucky to use 1GB for your entire library, let alone filling up 16GB worth. AppleBerrySandwich Preordered! Excited!!! BrenUK Will the Nvidia Spot work with the original Shield TV, so that we can use that for always listening functionality rather than having to buy a new remote or controller? Frank King Yes; that’s what it’s for. BrenUK Well that’s not primarily what it’s for is it? Primarily it’s for extending the listening functionality to another room. I was asking if it would work as a stand alone always listening mic on its own, on original Shield consoles – or if the set up means that you always have to have the new controller or remote as a primary listening device for it to work. Spencer Walker Confused is geforce now still 8 bucks a month on shield tv heard mixed things Frank King Yep; it’s not the same service as the PC/Mac one. Bradley Melnyk Love my shield, needed an excuse to buy another for my bedroom, can’t wait for this little gem to arrive!! Paul Hansen I said the same thing in the mate 9 giveaway. I loved the new shield announcement with spot. sonicyoof For the love of god, does it do proper rate switching with streaming video (switch to 24p)? There’s like zero devices that gets this and everything else right… Marc Corvo Anybody know if the spot has an aux out connection like chromecast audio or echo dot. I would love to hook that up to my high end “dumb” audio system. Karl Johnson The spot seems too expensive for what is gained. Another $150 to add just bedrooms. Then would like my office. The concept is fantastic but not sure worth it seattle tech You know CES is pretty weak when this is the favorite from CES. Some minor design changes but no spec bump, which was not needed. Adam Barrett So… is this really a new NVIDIA Shield? Doesn’t sound like it. Sounds like a lot of hype on an OS update. vidvox It’s just as “new” as the PS4 Slim with some great updates as well. MJ I miss my old NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV (ended up selling it) so looking forward to this “new” version. The Google Assistant integration should be interesting. I still can’t understand why zero internal hardware upgrades. OK, no new chipset but NVIDIA couldn’t up the RAM to 4 GB (my phone has that I don’t even play games on it) or give us more than 16GB of internal storage on the non -pro version? I guess including the remote does justify the pricing but still… Russ I read elsewhere that there’s also going to be a dongle that enables the Shield TV to serve as a Smart Things hub. This would make this the first device to successfully marry streaming TV, Chromecast, gaming, and home automation, plus Google Assistant. I was waiting for Google Home to come to Canada, but a 16Gb Shield TV and one Spot will do more and cost less than two Google Homes and a Chromecast. That’s compelling. Duder12 No dongles necessary Russ Dongles are necessary if you want ZigBee and Z-Wave. It’s also possible that you’ll have to buy the dongle to enable Smart Things functionality, but I could see that going either way. Sometimes_floss Its weird to me you didn’t mention the best part……Amazon Video Jeremy Turnley Did I miss that? Is it coming to the Shield natively with 4k? Sometimes_floss Oh big time Miguel Already pre-order mine (16gb), the additions make it even more worth it than before, bought a 128gb 3.0 flash drive to handle the rest. Dylan This is the best part of the announcement and it keeps getting skipped over in articles about NVIDIA at CES. I especially want confirmation that the Amazon Video app will come as part of the software update for the old SHIELD model. Have you seen anything about that anywhere? That missing app has been the only thing I don’t like about the SHIELD and why I’ve hesitated to recommend it to people want a streaming device and use Amazon Prime. Jeremy Turnley It’s on the screen at the end of the announcement video, I think that is the only real confirmation at this point. We’ll know on or around the 16th if rumors are true, since that is supposedly both the new one’s ship date and the old one’s software update day. goldcd It’s handy it’s there out of the box, but you can still sideload Amazon on the original shield tv. Duder12 It’s not 4k when sideload though. This is Dylan I didn’t have any luck sideloading, though I only tried it once. I got the app open but it would never let me log in and the interface was messed up even on the login screen. Any recommendations on that in case the update doesn’t include the Amazon Video app? Nathan Grebowiec The sideloading is super janky. It isn’t a true Android TV application at all. This option is 100% better. Patriciashamilton Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Raiders12 I think Steam client ability (if its full function) is actually the best, because it can make game streaming GPU agnostic, as opposed to exclusively Nvidia GPU and Gamestream. Fingers crossed its full Steam client capable!! TonyHoyleUK The problem is the announcement is ambiguous enough that it could just be another link to gamestream, which limits it to certain nvidia GPUs only. Until people have one in their hands we won’t know. michael arazan I’d a thought finally allowing Google Play and their Games would be the big up’s for it. They wouldn’t allow it before, and wanted a walled in system like amazon. json405 I’ve read (skimmed maybe) a press release somewhere similar to this one but I still don’t understand the difference between the old Shield TV Pro vs this one besides the new version of the controller? Wouldn’t the Shield TV Pro 1 get updated to the Nougat which would make it identical to the Shield TV Pro 2? Russ From what I’ve read, you are correct. Once the update hits, you’ll only need the new remote and controller to get all of the benefits on the original Shield TV Pro. Jeremy Turnley That’s correct. The only difference between the two hardware-wise is that the new one drops the microsd slot. The old one will get every software update that the new ones get, on the same day. So all you need to do to update to the new one is get the new controller and remote, if you even want to bother. Michael Habel The 16Gb also ditched the IR Receiver (For Harmony IR Remotes). TheDrunkenClam Same gpu and everything? This seems kind of disappointing. Tyler Durden But it’s still powerful. This also comes with the controller AND the remote this time. Frank King Yes it will. Joey Riz This announcement just made me happy I got last year’s 16gb b Model that’s included the micro SD slot and the IR receiver. The new 16gb is smaller yes but last year’s boxes are getting the same software including google assistant. Really side-grade if not a downgrade. Including the small remote is nice but it doesn’t have the 3.5 headphone jack on it…Need to buy that version separately anyway… Jeremy Turnley The new peripherals are supposed to be really nice though. The new remote is supposed to last a LOT longer between charges, and it has a IR blaster so potentially it is the only remote you need. And the new controller looks a lot less chunky than the old one; I don’t mind the old one, but it’s not as comfortable as my Xbox One S controller I use through bluetooth. Hopefully they made the new controllers buttons a little less spongy as well. Joey Riz Ya the new controllers with the always listening are cool and yes the tiny remote lasts forever but it’s because it is missing the best feature… The headphone jack. That’s why I say sidegrade cause the controllers are cool but I don’t think it’s all together better. If you did not buy last year’s box I would still get the 16gb and buy a 128gb 3.0 USB stick and turn on adoptable storage Jeremy Turnley Oh, it’s not better at all – it’s identical in hardware except for the loss of the SD slot. So unless you really needed it to be smaller – and the first one was pretty small, mine sits on top of my OG xbox one and doesn’t even block any fans – the new one is technically a downgrade. It’s literally just the peripherals that are improved. Michael Habel And, the best part?! There is nothing to stop anyone from just picking up the new Remote, and Gamepad… Michael Habel That’s why I call it the Shield TV Slim, and NOT the Shield TV2 Hristo Hristov I a hear constant clicking sounds if I listen to anything with headphones connected to the game controller. It is annoying. Godzilla Looks cool and everything but I already have two fire TVs, a PS4, and chromecasts on every TV I own. I just dont need this. That and does anyone else feel like google play movies dont stream at the same quality as amazon or especially Vudu? On an ethernet connection via PS4 i was seeing bad streaming. JruASAP I’m in the same boat. This looks really great, and I want one, but it’s tough to justify when I have a vizio smart tv, chromecast, ps4, ps3, wii u, and xbox one. I mostly use the xbox one for streaming now and it works well. Captain_Doug Anybody know if the 500GB model is a SSD or HDD? For that price I’d hope SSD. Joey Riz Same HDD as the OG 500gb model I’m sure Captain_Doug Why on earth would someone pay an extra $100 for that? Godzilla I wouldnt Joey Riz Well I got the 16gb model last year for that reason…I much rather stick an SD card in there for up the storage over a HDD…. Miguel Just buy a 128gb 3.0 flash drive, much faster than an SD Card. sagisarius Makes using it as a DVR a little easier I hear. Jeremy Turnley Not really, it has a pair of USB3 ports, so throwing on an external drive is cheaper and almost as easy. For that $100 you can easily get 3TB instead of 500GB. sagisarius I would love if it was just an upgradeable hard drive bay, like what’s on the PS3/4. But yeah, I don’t know, I have the 16gb version, that’s just what they pitch as the benefit. Jeremy Turnley Heh, gotta love marketing speak like that. “Easier”, indeed. Considering the thing picks up SD cards and USB HDDs with basically zero effort, I can’t imagine how much easier that really could be. Worst case for it being harder is you do that “I plugged the USB plug in the wrong way” thing. 😛 MJ Ummmm More storage? Saying that, I will be getting the non-pro version. Captain_Doug Everything will be slower on a hard drive. If you need more storage, you can get a 2tb external drive for $75 on amazon. Saving you $25 and ending up with 4x the storage and a faster. It makes no sense to pay more for less. MJ I said MORE storage not FASTER storage but an HDD is certainly fast enough to play 1080p video files or use as a DVR. Some people may not want a second box cluttering their home entertainment area or don’t want the “hassle”. Again, I wouldn’t get the “pro” version myself. alec peterson you can setup as plex media server natively and its going to produce faster data retrieve with onboard hdd than external storage. MJ You know damn well for “that price” it’s not going to be a 500GB SSD. Jérôme Besnard What really caught my eyes was the Samsung Chromebook Pro. Can’t wait for my kids to break our 3 year old Acer and replace it! 🙂 Jeremy Turnley I like it, but I cannot see spending that kind of money on a Chromebook. If the lower end version is $450, what does that make the pro? $600? $700? iluvthesoftsoft It’ll be $550, according to chromeunboxed. Jérôme Besnard Ponce there is an Android app that connect it to my Fujitsu scanner, that bad boy is mine. Senrab Nala Oh app for scanner. So good. Lol Jérôme Besnard Everything is called an app those days. Even Microsoft has an app store. What I need is a driver but there was no such thing in the Chrome OS world until Google decided to port Android app to the platform. Amen to that.

By Scott Matteson | January 9, 2017, 11:29 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/DragonImages Believe it or not, the first appearance of what we can term a computer program was written in 1842 by a woman named Ada Lovelace. 175 years later, the apps we use have come a long way. We've already seen how they can encompass and enrich every aspect of our lives; from productivity to navigation to social interaction to health monitoring to planning and scheduling our existences. Where can apps possibly go from here? The constraints are only based upon the limitations of our imagination — and the technology behind them, which continues to evolve. Based on my experience as a system administrator and in speaking with Natalie Lambert, vice president of marketing at Sapho, here's a list of 10 predictions for the app realm this year. 1. Social media footprints will expand You might call this a no-brainer, but social media programs are always upping the ante when it comes to involvement in what you're doing. I took my kids to the Edward M. Kennedy Senate Institute in Boston over Christmas break, checked in via Facebook and was then asked the next day to rate my experience. I was happy to do so, but the regularly prompts to rate where I've been get a bit cumbersome. I've also noticed as of late that when I take a photograph and post it to Facebook, the location service on my phone identifies my location and prompts me whether I should add it to my photo. This can be either helpful or creepy, depending on your perspective, but it reinforces the fact that social media apps are digging deeper into the activities and whereabouts of our lives. If you're a privacy advocate this is food for thought for 2017.

Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter 2. Better collaboration and interaction 2016 heralded an explosion of collaborative features in apps and this trend will only continue. Google Apps (now called G Suite) was among the pioneers of collaboration, of course, and others are following suit. Dropbox introduced easy sharing functionality via the new "Badge" feature. Google Keep makes it easy to share tasks with others, and entire platforms such as Trello and Rally (now CA Technologies) facilitate project workflows and workload assignment. Many apps have tie-ins to social media where you can share information with friends. Collaboration improves the usefulness of apps and helps serve as a form of "functional advertising" by engaging others (and some might argue increasing dependency on said apps), so expect to see more ways in which these features will appear. 3. More centralization I'm loathe to admit it, but my long-standing antagonism towards what I call "kitchen sink" apps or web portals is anachronistic. My original objection against them was based on too many half-baked features being crammed into a single interface, making it cluttered, confusing and difficult to support. Now my concerns are largely being eased, especially since subscription models and better customization (such as through dashboards) can make these interfaces easier to learn and navigate. For instance, my company uses a web portal called ServiceNow which is a veritable Swiss Army Knife of functions; a help desk ticketing system, an asset management solution, a change request platform, a service catalog where we can request equipment and an incident management section are just five examples of what it can do for us. Filters and various layout options allow us to focus on the areas we want to work with and remove irrelevant options. This tool is one in which I perform much of my work as a system administrator, and having a one-stop interface makes my job easier and helps boost productivity. Expect centralization to play a larger role in 2017 as the benefits and capabilities continue to increase. 4. More subscription models Speaking of subscription models, they may not always be popular, but they're here to stay. On Cyber Monday I paid about $75 for a year's access to a 1 Tb Dropbox storage plan. That's more for a service than an app (Dropbox is an app, true, but its focus is on providing storage), but the same principle applies overall. Gone are the days when you could pay a set fee for any given program and then own it for life as opposed to "renting" it via a recurring fee. In some cases you can do both, however. Microsoft Office is a perfect example; you can pay a yearly fee for Microsoft Office 365 which provides access to the programs and services you need (Office 365 Business costs $99 per year). Or you can still buy Office as a standalone product (Office 2016 for Home and Business retails at about $229). Subscription models make more sense for customers who need the latest and greatest features, and they make more sense for the businesses selling them since they increase engagement and loyalty (as well as revenue and dependency). As long as it's a win for both sides (rather than just the equivalent of a protection racket) I think this is a positive benefit. 5. More offline capabilities Even though mobile networks are expanding their capabilities and coverage, always-on connectivity remains a pipe dream. I spent a week camping in Bar Harbor, Maine this past summer and there was no mobile data access in our area, period. If you wanted to check Facebook, you had to go into town to get a signal. Maybe that's not such a big deal, since the whole purpose of getting away from it all is to disconnect, after all. But I could have really used access to Google Maps during some of our mountainous hikes, and it's gratifying to see that it's now possible to download map details to access them while offline (known as "offline areas"). Last September I wrote about a database concept called NoSQL which can bring offline access to mobile apps by storing data locally then synchronizing it with the live server when a device is online again. This kind of useful function is poised to expand in 2017 to improve app functionality. SEE: Seven mobile trends to look for in 2017 (CNET) 6. More intelligence Those of us who used Office 97 and 2000 were well-acquainted with the infamous Clippy, an office assistant who would appear and offer assistance based on what you were doing in a program. ("It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?") Anyone who's used a search engine such as Google (and if you're reading this I can almost guarantee you have) has probably also noticed the uncanny ability to interpret typos and hone in on results. And Amazon is quite adept at providing you with suggestions for things you might like based on your purchase history. My son and I enjoy a mobile app called the Akinator, which involves a cartoon genie that can quickly guess the identity of almost any person or being (real or imaginary) via a series of questions. It's a simple game, but it works with uncanny accuracy that often has me marveling at its deductive capabilities. The exact details of how it works are intentionally vague, but the basic structure depends on using a database with a binary search model or decision tree, in which each answer you provide the genie eliminates a set number of possible characters, increasing it's chances to guess correctly. If you somehow manage to stump the Akinator, (I managed this only once, using the character of Brady Hawkers from the 1980 made-for-TV film "The Gambler") you can upload details and photographs of the characters involved to help the Akinator learn from the experience and expand its knowledge. This is a consumer-based example, of course, but it represents the overall trend. As computational power and capacity grows, app intelligence will as well. 7. Greater interaction with AI Artificial intelligence isn't anything new, of course. We've been relying on Siri (and Cortana) for some time now, but the ante is going to get upped. You could argue that some forms of automation equate to artificial intelligence - the self-driving car, for instance, which TechRepublic recently tested at CES in Las Vegas. We'll see expansions in all related fields. A core concept here is that of the neural network, which models itself after organic brain functionality to make decisions or solve problems. Self-learning is a key component of this. Working with this model we can implement functions such as speech or language recognition (a universal translator for instance), autonomous machines such as cleaning robots which can perform routine functions based on their specific environment, and of course, better and more comprehensive interaction with computer-based "bots" that can assist us. CIO Dive says AI is poised to "transform corporate America in 2017" and goes so far as to state: "Companies that do not adapt applied AI will quickly perish or diminish in market size and value." The final three predictions come from Natalie Lambert, vice president of marketing at Sapho. 8. Simpler, more consumer-driven experiences "In 2017, employees will continue to shy away from using clunky enterprise software in favor of more simple business apps. Employees will expect the ability to complete simple tasks through micro apps, that enable one-click task completion from anywhere (and enable them to avoid their existing systems altogether). Similar to social media apps, these simple apps will alert employees when something requires their immediate attention through notifications and a personalized feed of actionable activities." 9. Omnichannel communication "As in-app payments and the ability to share a flight itinerary or dinner reservations through a text message become the norm, people will have a new expectation around how tasks are completed. This idea of not having to leave the platform or app you're in to complete a task or send an update will make its way into the work environment. Employees will want information from various applications delivered in the channel they're already using whether that be a communications channel, a browser, email, or a mobile device. I expect more workplace communication tools, such as the new Facebook Workspace or Microsoft Teams, to become THE place people go to communicate, collaborate, receive information, and complete tasks." 10. System modernization "Legacy, hard-to-use systems exist everywhere and upgrading them is not an option. Why? Because companies have huge investments in these systems and now have business critical data and processes stuck there. But, we have hit a breaking point - today's employees are saying 'no' to clunky software. They are demanding better ways to access their information and complete tasks. This means adopting more consumer-like functionality (see above), like personalized information feeds and push notifications, that sit on top of existing systems, so employees can get tasks done easily and have the most relevant information to make the best business decisions."

If so, you're in luck as you can now manage those backups with the help of Google Drive. Here's how. By Jack Wallen | January 9, 2017, 11:45 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen If you're an Android user, you know your device is backed up to your Google account. But where? Is it some nebulous, inaccessible location tucked away from sight? Believe it or not, Google has made the task of managing those backups incredibly easy, and it can all be handled from Google Drive. Don't get too excited. You cannot access the files within the backups. What you can do, however, is preview the backup (which really just means get information about the backup) and delete older backups. Depending on how many devices you have, this can actually go a long way in freeing up space on the Drive account. So, how do you manage this task? It's actually incredibly simple. Let me show you how. All about Drive Log into your Google Drive account. You may not have noticed it, but there's now a small cloud icon in the left navigation (Figure A). Figure A Accessing your cloud backups is simple from Google Drive. Once you've found the Backups icon, click it to reveal all of the current devices you have backed up to your Drive account (Figure B). Figure B Every device currently backed up to my Google Drive account. If you right-click one of the listed devices, you can then either preview or delete the backup file. Click Preview and you can see what has been backed up as well as the last time the device was backed up (Figure C). Figure C A OnePlus 3 backup preview. As you can see, my OnePlus 3 has 32 apps backed up, a call history of 58 KB, and device settings of 701 KB. Should I want to delete that particular backup, all I have to do is click the Delete backup button. From mobile Drive If you've installed Google Drive on your mobile device, you can manage your backups from there as well. Open Google Drive on your device and tap the three horizontal bars in the top left corner. In the left sidebar, scroll down and tap the entry for Backups. In the resulting window (Figure D), you will see the device you are using listed at the top as well as all other backed up devices. Figure D Managing your backups from Google Drive on Android. If you tap an entry for a backup, you will get the same information as seen in the backup preview from Google Drive. However, there's a bit more to mine here. Tap one of your backups and then tap the Apps entry. In the resulting window (Figure E), will be listed all of the backed up apps. Figure E A listing of backed up apps for my OnePlus 3 backup. That's as far as you can get with this (you cannot delete individual apps from the backup), but it is nice that you can manage the backups as easily with your mobile device. Why delete backups? Clearly the backups aren't taking up that much space (unless you have a large number of devices); why would you bother deleting a backup? There is a very good reason for this. I have had, on a couple of occasions, an instance where a backup (for unknown reasons) has gone corrupt. Because of this, when I reset the associated device, and the backup restored, the device wouldn't function. No matter how many times I attempted to restore the device from backups, it wound up in the same state. The only solution was to set up the Android device as brand new. However, when the device began backing up, it backed up to the same corrupt file. The only way around this was to delete the backup and start afresh. Is it ideal? No. Would it be nice if the backup could be opened and files extracted in the case of disaster recovery? Of course. However, having the ability to preview and delete these backups makes for some handy problem solving. Yes, it would be keen if more could be done with those backups, but I am certain the lockdown is done with good reason. Make the most of it Google has given you just enough power at the tips of your fingers. With this new(ish) feature (it rolled out the first week of Dec, 2016), you can take charge of the backups saved to your Google Drive account. It's not perfect, but it's a very good first step forward. Automatically sign up for TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise Newsletter for more hot tips and tricks.

Paul Sancya/AP | Caption Weston Williams Staff | @westonwolf359 January 9, 2017 —Self-driving cars may be one step closer to taking over the roads across the United States – and now, whole families can join in. Waymo, an independent company that spun off from Google's autonomous vehicle program in December of last year, showed off a new fleet of self-driving minivans to the general public at the North American auto show in Detroit on Sunday. The cars boast a sensor suite, created completely in-house for the first time, that gives the vehicles the ability to drive themselves. The company has announced that they plan to release the cars onto public roads by the end of the month. As various companies break into the fledgling self-driving market, autonomous vehicles are moving from test sites to streets all over the world. But despite dramatic leaps forward in self-driving technology, some critics have concerns that the enthusiasm for the prospect of self-driving cars may have outpaced the industry's ability to address the technological, legal, and security hurdles that have to be cleared before autonomous vehicles can revolutionize the world's roadways. Google's self-driving car division began in 2009, with a project to drive ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes without driver assistance. Since then, advances in technology and competition with other companies with their own autonomous vehicle programs, such as Tesla, Lyft, Uber, and even Apple, have led to a sort of corporate arms race to become the face of a new, driverless revolution. "Although activities surrounding the development of autonomous vehicles have existed ever since the 1920s, there has recently been a significant push by both the automotive and high tech sectors to make these vehicles a reality," writes Alex Wyglinski, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in an email to The Christian Science Monitor. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? But there are still a number of remaining obstacles for self-driving cars to overcome, technical and otherwise. Roadways filled with autonomous cars will put life-and-death ethical considerations in the hands of programs, Alice Fischer, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science at the University of New Haven in Connecticut, tells the Monitor via email.  "We anthropomorphize these vehicles," Dr. Fischer writes. "We imagine that they have 'sight' and can 'think.' However, their 'vision' is not like ours and their 'thoughts' are following pre-programmed rules and probabilities." And while ethical priorities might be programmed into vehicles, ultimately the decisions for what such programs will entail "will all be made to benefit the company that is building and selling the cars," she says. But corporations with autonomous vehicle divisions bill their vehicles as safer than human-driven cars. According to a September 2016 statement from Google, 94 percent of car accidents in the US are due, at least in part, to human error. The first recorded fatality in a Tesla vehicle utilizing automatic driving mode did, however, result from an error in the operating system's calculations, as the vehicle failed to register a large white truck against the sky. And the rareness of the autonomous vehicles themselves might help account for the low number of accidents, skewing perceptions about their safety. Still, many are optimistic. In October, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a subsection of the US Department of Transportation, signed on to the remarkable goal of zero traffic deaths in the US by 2046. The 30-year plan to bring the tens of thousands of roadway fatalities every year down to zero might depend on removing human error as a factor in road deaths. "The estimates of the number of lives that could be saved are grossly speculative, and apply only to the case that all cars are car-bots," Fischer says. "Achieving this goal would require a very large change in state laws – basically, to outlaw real cars." The prohibition of human operated vehicles presents its own problems, not the least of which is equitable accessibility, Fischer says. Currently, autonomous vehicle equipment is prohibitively expensive for most consumers, and poor families would likely be unable to afford them, even with mass production. That said, bringing down the price of self-driving cars would likely be a priority for many companies. Waymo's sensor suite in its new autonomous minivans were all made in-house, bringing ring down costs significantly. For instance, sensors worth $75,000 back in 2009 now only cost the company $7,500 to build itself, according to The Verge. Fischer also notes that "smart" vehicles are extremely hackable and contain a number of unaddressed security risks. Without proper protection, such cars' connectivity could be exploited and even actively controlled by hackers.

Sure, it’s not too hard to buy things for those we know well. Things can get a little more frustrating when we have to pick out things for family members we only really see once a year though. With that said and another holiday season done and dusted, let’s sit back and review how everyone else did by taking a look at 6 of the most popular presents of the 2016 festive season. Google Home One of the most popular presents among casual music lovers this year, Google Home is the latest product from Google and is a voice activated speaker. With dual microphones and Wi-Fi connection, Google Assistant can understand all of your ‘Okay Google’ commands. Its simple yet sleek design also comes with a customizable base to ensure it fits nicely in whichever room you use it. Priced at only $129, this was a very popular and affordable holiday gift. Xbox One S The newest edition to Microsoft’s gaming series is the Xbox One S. An upgrade from the original Xbox One, the One S is smaller than its predecessor. Classed as the ultimate gaming and entertainment system, the new system upgrades allow it to play 4K videos and displays high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. With a price of $300, it may not have been the most enticing gift to buy for some. Of course, being an Xbox it was still always going to be a popular gift among loved ones and gamers worldwide. Hatchimals Hatchimals were one of the hottest items at many of this years toy expos. Naturally, they found their way onto many young girls’ Christmas lists, making them one of the most popular gifts of the season. The big egg that eventually hatches into an animal is speckled with color and comes already charged so the countdown begins as soon as you purchase it. You won’t know when it will hatch or which of the 8 creatures you have inside until it hatches. Although the color splashes on the egg seem to reflect the animal inside, the egg will begin to shake when it’s getting ready to hatch. With a retail price of $60, you may have had to pay a little more to get your hands on one of these, as they sold out in most major stores. Light Up Shoes You may remember Light Up Shoes from the 90s, as something out of ‘Back To The Future’. However, if you were to go by many kids’ holiday gifts this year, it seems that shoes with LED lights on their soles are back in style. These days though they’re a tad more advanced. With Light Up Shoes being USB rechargeable and having a 6 to 8-hour battery life. They also come with a portable remote so you can control the color and flashing style of the LED lights on the go. It’s fair to say, these sneakers made a pretty flashy and futuristic gift. They weren’t that expensive either with a simple pair costing less than $40. Cozmo Speaking of remote controls, here’s one holiday gift that blew all other remote control toys out of the water. Comzo, the robot toy, is basically a super computer on wheels that’s controllable from an iOS and Android app. Apart from the ability to play games and interact with it, Comzos are also able to learn and explore on its own. It’s basically a personal robot that’s always willing to hang out and play. Costing $179, it may not be as expensive as you’d expect for getting your own robot friend. Which is why it made it under so many Christmas trees. What popular gifts do you think will make the cut for 2017? Get An Awesome Life I'm in!

Jan 03, 2017 Online review battles heat up Dec 29, 2016 Amazon Operations>Technology Asking Alexa: What’s for dinner? Amazon Echo and Google Home become marketing voice for restaurants Lisa Jennings | Jan 09, 2017 As Amazon’s voice-activated Echo products and rival brand Google Home work their way into more households, restaurants are hoping to get a piece of the artificially intelligent action.  The cloud-based voice services are the hottest tech toy of 2017, allowing users to play music, find recipes or set a timer with a simple verbal command, along with many other things. Both products, for example, will list restaurants near any particular location, if asked. But Amazon is taking its relationship with restaurants even further, allowing users of the Echo and its related products to “ask Alexa,” as its female voice is named, to order restaurant meals for delivery.  Amazon Prime members have been able to order free restaurant delivery in an hour or less since 2015 through the website and app. The service is available in 20 cities across the U.S., including thousands of restaurants. That geographic coverage is growing. Amazon, after all, knows a bit about delivery logistics. Using Alexa to order delivery hands-free makes it that much easier. The only caveat: customers can only order through Alexa if they have ordered delivery in the past through Amazon.com. For a first-time order, it’s not practical for Alexa verbally to list all menu items. But if guests have ordered before, Alexa can pull up the customer’s order history from a specific restaurant or cuisine type and list the meal options available for reorder. Amazon delivery has no fees for Prime members, and no menu markups. The cost to restaurants, however, is unclear. Amanda Ip, a spokesperson for Amazon Restaurants, says she couldn’t disclose details, but restaurants have to be a part of Amazon’s family of merchants. To do that, the first step is to contact Amazon through amazon.com/restaurants-merchants. The company, however, looks for certain criteria and considers customer input in deciding which restaurants to work with. “We want to include restaurants our customers want to order from, and that will vary by city,” she says. Recently, DineTime has added another feature that will help consumers use Alexa to decide where to eat out. Guests can ask the wait time at their restaurant of choice. DineTime is a restaurant network of QSR Automations, the Louisville, Ky.-based provider of restaurant hardware and software. The company provides table management, kitchen display systems and other services to more than 70,000 restaurants around the world. Because QSR Automations is already tapped into restaurant guest lists and kitchen systems, that data can be used to predict wait times at any of their client restaurants. Soon, guests may also be able to use Alexa to put their names on a waiting list or make a reservation, said Lee Leet, founder and CEO of QSR Automations. And in 2017, Alexa’s voice-activated technology will also be incorporated into the DineTime app to allow guests a hands-free way to ask about restaurant wait times, even if they don’t have an Echo or related product, Leet said. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT AMAZON RESTAURANT DELIVERY Amazon Restaurant delivery is available for free to Prime members only.  To get your restaurant listed by Alexa for delivery to Prime members, contact Amazon Restaurants to join their family of merchants: amazon.com/restaurants-merchants. Keep in mind Amazon considers consumer requests for restaurant delivery. Amazon Restaurant delivery is available in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Baltimore; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas; Houston; Los Angeles; Phoenix; Portland, Ore.; Manhattan; Miami; Minneapolis; Northern Virginia; Orlando, Fla.; San Diego; the San Francisco Bay area; Seattle; and Tampa. Find out whether your restaurant is within your city’s service area. Delivery might be available in your city, but not necessarily your neighborhood, though Amazon’s geographic coverage is growing rapidly.

Advertisement For several months now, Google Nexus smartphone and tablet users have been using the company’s latest Android operating system. Android N, now called Android Nougat, is available right now for select Nexus/Pixel smartphones, Nexus tablets, and select phones from Android manufacturers. Samsung Galaxy smartphone and tablet owners should be keeping tabs on Samsung’s progress as we push into 2017. Why? Simple. The Samsung Galaxy Nougat release has begun for some of the company’s devices and we expect the roll out to pick up steam as we push deeper into 2017. Advertisement Today we want to take a look at everything we know so far about Samsung’s plans for its Galaxy smartphone and tablet owners.  This roundup is going to walk you through the important details about Samsung’s Galaxy Android Nougat updates and the Samsung Galaxy Nougat release. Samsung still isn’t saying all that much about its Android Nougat release but this roundup includes information about the Galaxy S7 Nougat update, the Galaxy S6 update, the Galaxy Note 5 update, the Galaxy Note 4 update, and more. We’ll continue to update this as we, and others, receive more information about Samsung’s plans for Android Nougat. Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat Update Let’s start with what we know about the Android Nougat update itself. Advertisement Samsung’s Nougat beta and the final release have confirmed a number of features coming to Galaxy devices. Each Galaxy Nougat update (updates for older devices typically aren’t as robust and carriers typically tack on their own changes) will be a bit different though we expect the core group of features to be the same across the board. If you’re unfamiliar with the Android Nougat update’s features, take a look at our walkthrough and comparison versus the Android Marshmallow update. You’ll also want to take a look at Samsung’s own Android Nougat guide. The consumer guide outlines the differences between Android Nougat and Marshmallow. The guide outlines the changes in great detail and will help you prepare for the changes coming with Samsung’s upcoming upgrade for your device. Samsung Galaxy S7 Nougat Update Unlike previous versions of Samsung Android updates, Android Nougat on Galaxy devices looks a lot like Google’s version of Android. The videos here are from the beta but they’ll give you a feel for the changes on board the official version of Nougat. Samsung’s official version of Nougat for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge is currently based on Android 7.0, not Android 7.1.1. You’ll quickly notice slight changes to the UI’s color scheme. You can get a feel for these changes in the video above. You’ll also notice some changes to the Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge camera interface. The changes are similar to those found on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7’s version of Android. An update to the official Samsung Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge guides now goes into detail about many of the changes coming with Samsung’s Android Nougat update. The guide for the Galaxy S7 Edge, which can be found here in English, will talk you through the official version of the Nougat update. Here are a few of the highlights: App folders are now transparent. Samsung Pass: you no longer have to remember passwords. Device Maintenance: helps you optimize battery, performance, and security. A Device Maintenance panel for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. New calendar interface. Improved battery usage meter. You can now sleep apps to save battery life. Video Enhancer tool: improves audio and video quality. Again, these are Galaxy S7 Nougat features and we expect each Nougat update from Samsung to be a bit different. Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat Release Date Samsung’s Nougat roll out date for Galaxy smartphones and tablets is finally here for the select people with select devices. Early rumors and reports suggested that Samsung’s first Galaxy Android Nougat updates would roll out in Q4 of 2016. Q4 includes October, November and December. Those rumors were off-base. Instead, most carriers are preparing to roll out their Nougat updates in in 2017. Samsung Galaxy S7 Nougat Release Here are a few things we know about the Samsung Galaxy Nougat S7 release date: A stable Android 7.0 Nougat build is rolling out to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge though the roll out appears to be limited to beta testers. The update is 215MB for the Galaxy S7. A report claims the Galaxy S7 Nougat update will start rolling out in Europe on January 17th. This could be the date it rolls out to non-beta testers. Galaxy smartphone carriers are also starting to chime in with their own information about the Galaxy Android Nougat release date. Australia carrier, Vodafone Australia, has confirmed plans to release Samsung Android Nougat updates in the future. Vodafone’s confirmed Nougat updates for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge though it says that issues were found during testing and that it’s “awaiting new software from Samsung.” Vodafone Australia isn’t the only carrier talking about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat release. In an announcement to its Android 7.0 Nougat beta testers, Verizon confirmed its Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Nougat update releases for 2017. Here is the statement it sent out to beta testers: Dear Customers, Verizon will stay on the original software for the remainder of this trial. Beta trial users will be upgraded to the commercial N release when it is available early next year. Thanks, Galaxy Beta Program Team While a specific release date remains unclear, Android Nougat powered Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge models recently received Wi-Fi certifications, a sign that a widespread release is indeed inching closer. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Active Android Nougat has also appeared in benchmarks which means Samsung is likely testing the software behind the scenes. The Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Samsung Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, and Samsung Galaxy Note 5 will reportedly be first in line to the Android Nougat update. Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, & More Australian carrier Optus says that it plans to release the Android Nougat for the Samsung Galaxy A5 later this month. The carrier doesn’t confirm a specific roll out date. The carrier is currently testing the software which means there’s no guarantee it will arrive in January. Android updates are often delayed due to the testing process. Samsung’s reportedly started development on the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge Android Nougat updates with a release expected later this year. The updates are expected to include a number of important changes. The Samsung Galaxy S6 Android 7.0 Nougat update recently surfaced in a GFXBench benchmark, a sign that the update is progressing behind the scenes. The company’s also rumored to have started development on the Galaxy Note 5 Android Nougat update and the Galaxy Tab S2 Android Nougat update. The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Android 7.0 Nougat update recently was spotted in a benchmark. Same goes for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 Nougat update, the Galaxy A5 update, and the Galaxy A3 Nougat update. All three have shown up in benchmarks which means they are likely in testing in Samsung’s labs. The Samsung Galaxy J3 Android Nougat update just appeared in a Wi-Fi certification, a sign that it’s in development behind the scenes. In addition, the company is also reportedly working on Android Nougat updates for the Samsung Galaxy A7, Galaxy A8, Galaxy A9, and the Samsung Galaxy A9 Pro Nougat updates. Look for these updates to start pushing out in early-to-mid 2017, sometime after Samsung gets Nougat out to its flagship models. In the United States, T-Mobile’s confirmed Nougat updates for the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. All of these updates are currently in the “Manufacturer Development” which means they still have a long way to go before they are released to the public. All of them will go through internal testing at T-Mobile before they are released to the public. They are likely still weeks away from touching down. Other vocal North American carriers, like Canadian provider Telus, remain silent about their plans for Android Nougat. Android 7.1.1 Nougat Google’s Android 7.1 Nougat update is now available for select Nexus devices around the world. As expected, it’s packed with new features and bug fixes for lingering Nougat problems. Samsung hasn’t confirmed anything yet but it looks like it will base its Android Nougat updates, at least the initial ones, on Android 7.0. This is a bit odd given that a recent soak test hinted at the release of of Android 7.1.1. The next three quarterly maintenance releases of Android Nougat will be Android 7.1 / 7.1.1 / 7.1.2 — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 28, 2016 The Samsung Galaxy S7 Android Nougat update that’s rolling out right now is based on Android 7.0, not Android 7.1.1. We could see a shift to Android 7.1.1 down the road but for now it looks like the update is based on the previous version. For more on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, take a look at our walkthrough. It compares Android 7.1.1 to Android 7.0 and Android Marshmallow. Samsung January Security Update The initial batch of Samsung Galaxy Nougat updates will roll out with Samsung’s January security update on board. The company recently posted the patch notes to its website and the patch comes with several key patches for known exploits. For more on the January security patch, take a look at Samsung’s website. It outlines all of the patches in great detail. 10 Things to Do Before Installing Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow Get Familiar with Android 6.0.1 & Marshmallow   1 / 10 Let's start with something very important.  One of the first things you'll want to do is get familiar with the changes coming with your version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Each update is going to be a little bit different (carriers can't help themselves) but there some core elements to each.  There are a number of resources around the web but we'll provide you with some great starting points right here.  We've taken a deep dive into the differences between Lollipop and Marshmallow and you'll want to check the basics out so that you're comfortable with the changes.  Android 6.0.1, the version of Marshmallow rolling out to Galaxy devices, is a little different than Android 6.0. You can get familiar with some of Android 6.0.1's basics right here. And then we get to the device level. That is to say that the Galaxy S6 Marshmallow update is a little different than the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update. We've outlined some of those differences and you can find them at the links provided.  Things will be different at the carrier level as well and you'll want to look into those changes as well. Unfortunately, those changes will arrive whenever Samsung and your carrier decide to push out Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for your device. We'll provide you with the Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow release notes as an example.  If you haven't been following along, now is a great time to look into the new features and enhancements so that you're as proficient as possible after you download and install Marshmallow on your Galaxy phone or tablet.    1 / 10 27 Responses 08/15/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply I am using s6edge plus I think that samsung should give Marshalltow on it please 08/25/2016 William Bogardus Reply Didn’t someone say that the Note 7 would be released within Android 7.0 upgrade? seems like no one’s telling the truth.

The Latest New Products Must-See Join CNET Member Benefits Sign In to CNET My Profile Forums Sign Out Australia China France Germany Japan Korea United Kingdom US Editions English Español Building robot Frankenstein from the pieces of CES 2017 Let's combine the best parts of the robots and digital-assistant devices we saw at the show and see how close we are to having the perfect mechanical butler. Chris Monroe/CNET Smart Home by Andrew Gebhart 10 January 2017 6:38 am AEDT @GebAndrew Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home I want Rosie the Robot to become a reality. As ambitious as a cartoon character from a 1960s TV Show might seem, I saw a lot of the pieces to make a pretty good Rosie at CES 2017. The pieces were just spread out between a bunch of different devices. The idea at the heart of Rosie is what appeals to me -- a do-it-all smart-home machine that can not only interact with you, but will take care of the chores. The perfect Rosie is a useful member of the family that acts as a nanny, a maid and a personal assistant. Rosie would need to be mobile, perceptive, possessing of fine motor skills and intelligent enough to hold a conversation. So how close are we really? Let's put the pieces together and find out. Mobility and perception: Kuri Kuri's smile is adorable. Photo by Chris Monroe/CNET A robot the size of R2-D2 with the look of a Pixar character, Kuri's meant to patrol your home and do it with charm. You'll need to give Kuri a tour of your living space by guiding it around with the app. Then, you can tell Kuri which room is which and the cute little guy will find his own way from there. He uses lasers to sense what's in front of him and avoid objects. Kuri is also my pick for perception. He has cameras behind his eyes, so you can see what Kuri sees via an app. During the day, you can tell Kuri to patrol your place and look for anything out of the ordinary. Kuri has motion and sound detection, so he'll normally follow a specific route, but if he hears something strange, he can go check it out. I'd imagine a diligent Rosie would do the same. 14 The robots of CES 2017 Kuri promises to have facial recognition, too. You'd definitely want your robot butler to know who you are, but here's where I'm skeptical that the tech we have is ready. I haven't seen a reliable, consumer-facing facial recognition camera yet -- though, the Netatmo Welcome comes close. Since Kuri travels on wheels, he won't move to multiple floors, but the robots I saw at CES with legs move much too slowly to be useful, even on a single floor. Nannying: Aristotle The always-listening device on the right responds to both "Aristotle" and "Alexa." Photo by Tyler Lizenby/CNET Head here for everything Aristotle can do to help watch over your child. It's quite a long list. Mattel's Aristotle is an always-listening device similar to the Amazon Echo. It has Amazon's assistant Alexa built in, complete with Alexa's robust library of skills. Plus, Aristotle works as an assistant on its own, one tailor-made for a nursery. From singing lullabies to ordering diapers to helping with homework, Aristotle's best features present intuitive ways to help your kids then they need it. Aristotle also comes with a camera, and Mattel claims it can recognize when your baby wakes up, and start playing a lullaby automatically. You can also set Aristotle not to answer your kids questions until they say "please." Those sort of touches are why Aristotle is my pick for nanny, though it obviously can't pick up, rock or feed your kids itself. Personal assistant: Rokid Alien You can make video calls using the Alien's screen. Photo by Tyler Lizenby/CNET This is an upset pick to be sure, but I'll bring Amazon's Alexa and the Google Assistant into the equation later. I want Rokid's assistant Melody on board for one specific reason: Melody can keep your whole family's calendar organized. An Echo copycat in a lot of ways, the Rokid Alien on display at CES promises much more control over appointments than either Alexa or the Google Assistant can provide right now. Google Home -- the always-listening gadget from Google in the mold of the Echo -- can tell you about one of your calendars. Rokid's variation on the theme integrates all of them and all of your family's calendars too. Ask Melody, "What time are we all free on Thursday?" and she'll tell you. You can then add something to the calendar and Melody is smart enough to add it to everybody else's as well. The Alien also has a screen, allowing you to make video calls and see more info after you ask it a question. Miscellaneous extras: Lynx and Mykie That's Lynx striking a pose. Photo by Chris Monroe/CNET I thought Lynx -- a humanoid robot from Ubtech Robitics with Alexa built in -- would account for more of my pieces. The bot has the body I would like for Rosie, but Lynx's feet don't move forward fast enough for it to be truly called mobile. Lynx balances really well from side to side, though, and its arms and legs move and bend as well. Lynx's coolest feature uses that flexibility to teach you yoga and walk you through exercise routines. I'd like that feature in this Frankenstein bot. Mykie projects recipe guidance onto the wall. Photo by Chris Monroe/CNET I'll bring Mykie's recipe prowess on board to help you cook. Give Mykie a voice command and you can search recipes. Find the one you want and Mykie will project a video guide on the wall to help you through the process. Conversationalist: Alexa and Google Now, I need to make sure this Rosie can understand me when I talk to it. Fortunately, Amazon, Google and Apple have all taken the voice-recognition abilities of digital assistants quite far from the days of yelling "Call Mom!" at a flip phone. 14 Here's the latest smart home gear that works with Alexa Both Amazon and Google have turned those abilities into always-listening devices that respond to your commands, answer your questions, and control your smart home. Since I'm cherry-picking, I'll take Alexa's breadth of skills, since it's extraordinary, and I'll take Google's conversational prowess. Google can use the context of your previous question to answer your next question, just like an attentive robot helper should. The Google Assistant isn't great at this. Go beyond simple, fill-in-the-blank context and you'll confuse it, but it's still slightly better at it than Alexa. 57 Check out all the smart home products at CES 2017 (so far) Maid: MoRo Finally, we need this new magical robot to do the chores. Now, lots of robots can do one chore quite well. Beyond obvious appliances like dishwashers, robot vacuums can keep a place tidy and you can find similar window cleaners and mops. However, for Rosie to truly become a reality, this couldn't be a robot specifically designed for one task. Sure, we could throw suction power on the bottom of Kuri's wheels, but we need a robot to be able to take out the trash, pick up dishes, and fold the laundry. We saw Foldimate on display at the show, but it was barely working and still a single-function machine. We need a robot with arms and fine motor skills. The $30,000 MoRo comes the closest, even though it's fairly slow, as you might expect. Ideally, MoRo would make Mykie irrelevant for this Frankenstein, as it could do the cooking for you. At CES, MoRo could slowly pick up and move blocks, but I'd want to see it refined quite a bit before I'd trust it to put away my dishes or dust my TV. Say hello to MoRo, the $30,000 assistant robot Got robot? MoRo will bring you drinks, get your groceries and listen to voice commands... in theory. by Lexy Savvides 1:12 Close Drag What do we have? Putting it all together, the Rosie of CES 2017 moves around on a single floor pretty well. She uses wheels for locomotion, but has legs and a body attached to the wheels so she can flex and guide you in a workout routine. I'll use Kuri's face and eyes for the head and make the Alien's screen the body for info and videos. Altogether, this Rosie would look a little weird. She'd be quite expensive, even if we don't add in the $30,000 MoRo, the cost of everything else combined (based largely on unfinalized prices and estimates) would be between $2,500 and $3,000. Since some components could be shared, and the cost of creating one robot would be less than individually producing seven different ones, maybe the final total could be cut to just under $2,000? Plus, she's not great at picking things up physically -- especially if we leave out MoRo -- or holding a conversation, but she can check on the home when you're away and let you know if something's wrong. Better yet, she responds to all sorts of commands and questions, and can tell your child a bedtime story or sing a lullaby. She's not perfect, but I'm excited by how many pieces of the future we found at CES 2017.

At the North American Auto Show’s Automobili-D conference on Sunday, the CEO of Google’s self-driving car project Waymo delivered a keynote address that proved just how far the initiative has come. As John Krafcik revealed, Waymo actually built the entire sensor suite used by its most recent test vehicles, the self-driving Pacifica minivans. This means no more depending upon third party suppliers to cobble together disparate pieces of technology to create a single car — rather, Waymo is getting closer than anyone else to taking care of the whole enchilada. The ability to create self-driving technology in-house could be huge for Waymo, as it will likely allow for more seamless integration between various components like sensor hardware, sensor fusion software, image recognition, and more. Krafcik noted that Waymo has created two new categories of lidar, the system that serves as the “eyes” of self-driving cars, in order to create its own sensors. While older iterations of autonomous vehicles have used just one top-mounted medium-range lidar, Waymo has introduced new short- and long-range sensing units to give cars a more complete look at its surroundings, both in its immediate vicinity and further away. More: Interview: Ford’s Jim McBride talks driverless cars, autonomous safety, and more But technology aside, Waymo’s ability to develop its own technology could save the Google project quite a bit of money. According to Krafcik, whereas the cost of a single high-end lidar system was $75,000 when Google first began its self-driving car tests, it’s now dropped by 90 percent as a result of its in-house technologies. We’ll soon be able to see these homegrown sensors and such in Arizona and California later in January, as Pacifica minivans will soon be outfitted with the new suite. Thus far, Waymo boasts nearly 2.5 million miles on the road with its self-driving cars, and by the end of 2017, it will likely have passed 3 million miles. And as it develops more and more of its technology by its lonesome, a self-driving future may not be so far away. Also watch: Share

In this June 7, 2010 file photo, Apple CEO Steve Jobs holds the new iPhone 4 during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Happy birthday, iPhone. You’re 10 years old! What do you want to be when you grow up? When Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 10 years ago today, he touted Apple’s ability to combine three products -- “a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls, and a breakthrough internet communications device with desktop-class email, web browsing, searching and maps -- into one small and lightweight handheld device.” Those characteristics are still in today’s iPhones, but they’re so much more. Think over 2 million apps more, changing everything from the way we commute to the way we communicate with family and friends. At the same time, it has spawned hundreds of copycats and created new industries that couldn’t exist without phones. The iPhone is the most successful consumer device ever created. The original iPhone (left) compared to the current iPhone, the 7 Plus. Sarah Tew/CNET So where does it go from here? For Apple, the next 10 years will be about refining and simplifying its hugely popular phone. Whether the iPhone remains a rectangular slab of glass for the next decade is anyone’s guess (or, rather, up to chief designer Jony Ive). Importantly, what will become an even bigger focus will be everything else that surrounds the iPhone, like virtual reality and smart home. “iPhone is an essential part of our customers’ lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement posted in Apple’s online newsroom. “iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come.” Here are some of CNET’s predictions: Simplicity iPhones used to celebrate just doing a few things well. Now, iOS and the iPhone are endlessly complex. Settings and hidden Easter eggs lurk everywhere. Managing cloud storage and photos, or navigating notifications and privacy will send you down rabbit holes. Apple could aim for simplicity once again, paring down the experience to something more essential. It might find a way of pushing only a few things to your attention while keeping the rest in the background. It needs to reinvent its design, even the software, to be less cluttered. And then there are all the phones. There used to be one iPhone... now there are models in different sizes, colors and processors. One rumor has Apple offering multiple display types next year. The reality of the phone market is Apple will have to continue to meet different budgets and lifestyles. There’s no going back to that single original iPhone. Connecting to everything The iPhone’s already a hub for our fitness trackers, the Apple Watch and a growing world of smart home appliances and connected gadgets. The latest version of iOS included smart home shortcuts built into the Control Panel, like a home-based remote control. Imagine more of that spreading across more devices and services. It’ll be able to talk to other gadgets more easily. Bluetooth 5 promises greater range and higher speeds to connect to other peripherals. In a home, that could make a huge difference. A wild card could be Wi-Gig, an extremely high-bandwidth, short-range variation of Wi-Fi that could be a path to how future iPhones could mirror instantly to larger screens or accessories. Play Video CBSN The iPhone 8 could have wireless charging The next generation of iPhones may be designed with wireless charging, so that you never have to plug your phone into an outlet again. CNET edito... Deeper AI Amazon Echo opened the door. Talking to your gadget is now awesome, not annoying. Siri, however -- which lives on nearly all Apple devices -- is still problematic. It’s not as responsive as Amazon’s Alexa or as intuitive as Google Assistant. It should do more and understand context better. A more ambient, helpful iPhone is a necessary next step. Consider Assistant and how it lives on Google’s Pixel phone, ready to help. iOS 9 takes a few steps there, but expect Apple to continue knitting together apps and services with AI and machine learning. The interesting twist is the company’s emphasis on doing its computations on-device, instead of in the cloud. That’s a completely different approach than Google and Amazon, one rooted in privacy. Apple’s latest Photos app smartly organizes photo libraries by faces and places and automatically knits together memory-reel trailers around themes. Better Siri and smarter AI aren’t just what the iPhone needs; it’s what Apple needs across the board. Totally port-free We’re all sad about losing the headphone jack. What about losing the rest? MacBooks and iPhones have shaved down their inputs to just a few options in 2016. Next, perhaps, comes Lightning. Charging, for iPhones, still happens via the Lightning cable. Contactless charging -- the type that has been available for Android phones for years, and is used by the Apple Watch, hasn’t arrived yet. But when it does, perhaps in the iPhone 8, that Lightning cable will be a lot less necessary. We already can transfer files locally via AirDrop or stream via AirPlay. It would be shocking if Apple followed up a headphone jack-free iPhone 7 with a completely closed-off iPhone 8, but someday there will be an iPhone that flirts with going full wireless. All-screen The iPhone still has bezels, areas of the front of the phone where the screen doesn’t extend. For instance, consider the area around the Home Button. Samsung’s recent phones have gone nearly edge-to-edge, and even wrapped the display around the sides. A bezel-free all-screen iPhone would fill up more screen space in a smaller size for an easier grip. Reports of Touch ID being integrated into the display would mean you’ll just touch a part of the screen to log in or pay. Play Video CBS Evening News Apple on the rise after releasing newest iPhone The iPhone 7 went on sale Friday after selling out all of their inventory in presale orders. Apple expects to sell 226 million phones in the next... The cloud, the cloud Apple’s relationship with cloud services feels overcomplicated. Google and Amazon offer lots of free storage and syncing options. With iCloud, paying for the right storage tier can get pricey. Relying on the cloud has become an answer for accessing files (there’s an iCloud Drive folder, now) and photos. But how do photos and videos get managed properly? Despite a growing number of alternative cloud-storage options, it’s hard to keep things organized properly. Cloud services are what’s bringing Mac OS and iOS closer together, sharing iMessage, file storage, photos, Notes and Pages files. Cloud services like those from Google co-exist, sometimes beautifully, sometimes awkwardly. Phones are, more than ever, just small terminals to a huge connected system. The iPhone’s going to be increasingly dependent on the cloud. AR and VR Samsung has already turned its flagship phones into mobile virtual reality accessories via Gear VR. Google has the Daydream headset and its Cardboard initiative. Apple, however, has stayed quiet on VR. Instead of thinking about a pair of phone-goggle accessories, consider the possibilities of a more advanced camera. Google Tango -- an augmented reality initiative under the same umbrella as Daydream’s VR -- uses depth-sensing 3D cameras to scan a room and help project imaginary things into it... or, track movement so that a VR headset could feel like it’s really mapping motion. Cook has stated his interest in augmented reality, which probably indicates that more advanced camera features could be where things go next. Much like the iPhone 7 Plus can sense depth with its dual cameras, imagine more advanced cameras that can enable augmented reality like Google Tango. Then imagine that these cameras could do power tracking for a VR headset, like the Occipital Bridge. Maybe that’s way too much in the weeds for Apple, a company that seems to prefer sleek minimalism. But it’s a short jump for the iPhone to adopt AR or VR. The original iPhone came with 4GB of storage. James Martin/CNET Moving past the phone itself The biggest change in the iPhone of 2027 is that it may not be a phone at at, at least not in the sense of the device we know today. What could be more vital about mobile computing over the next decade is what’s around the phone. Apple already envisions the iPhone as the remote control for our lives; over the next 10 years, that remote will extend to things like VR and smart homes and cities. And much like the iPod got obliterated, the iPhone may go the same way. Phones may work like Chromecasts, where devices pick up and stream based on what another tells it. Or the Apple Watch can serve as the key to tying connected devices together. Apple is already exploring cross-device communication; if your phone rings, so does your Mac or iPad. “There’s at least one vision of the future where the phone as a discrete device goes away and turns into other interfaces like wearables,” Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said. Input, output and the brains of a product will be “less tied to a specific device over the years.” This article originally appeared on CNET.com.  © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

After all, the best ideas often come from our darkest dreams. 2017 could well be the year of AI, with intelligent machines invading our lives on a daily basis. Think Amazon’s Echo speakers and Alexa assistant, Google’s Allo messenger or IBM’s Watson supercomputer. You already know this brave new world of self-driving cars, self-flying drones, virtual butlers running households and sensors to monitor hospital patients. Yet content management systems, a logical area for AI, have yet to tap its potential.  Early inroads are being made. AI is being used in content management to analyze past and current consumer behavior, to help determine priorities, to predict which customers are likely to buy particular products or services and the best way to reach and engage them. How AI Is Already Changing Digital Interactions 1. Searching Google directs a large part of its millions of search queries to RankBrain, an AI system that interprets and processes the search terms or questions. RankBrain’s mission is to learn more about the semantics of your search and to teach itself how to better give you the answers it thinks you want.  2. Generating Content The Associated Press (AP) uses the Wordsmith platform from Automated Insights for most of its corporate earnings reports.  Short stories are now produced in less time than it takes reporters. The number of stories increased from 300 human-created to over 4,400 automatically generated each quarter. Gartner estimates that 20 percent of business content will be authored by machines by 2018.  3. Designing Websites Imagine an AI assistant that asks you a few questions about your business and the kind of website you want. Et voilà — you get a fully functional website, without any coding or project management. Platforms like The Grid or Wix already have algorithms and rules in place for creating websites. 4. Promoting and Propagating Content Twitter bots can make this process faster and more streamlined, enabling marketers to publish and push content automatically across the platforms they want. Automated tweets can even be set to match user moods and emoticons. 5. Predicting Choices EasyJet uses AI to predict customer choices from anything like flight destinations to food and drink items served on flights. The North Face and 1-800-Flowers.com use AI tools as shopping assistants: to quickly and correctly answer product questions and to make spot-on recommendations. 6. Moving Conversions Airbnb uses an in-house AI tool that lets Airbnb hosts see how they should set their property prices each day to make it most likely to be rented. If a host has priced it right, those dates show up green on the calendar. If the price is too high, the dates show up red. The host can adjust the price on a slider and hit that sweet spot to cover costs and not lose customers. A lot of AI seems to be directed at automating tasks in the content management chain, such as content creation, posting, tweeting and advertising. But is this AI? Is it “artificial” and “intelligent”?  In an ideal CMS world, we can dream of some AI applications. How AI Could Transform Content Management 1. Spotting Tasks An AI tool that identifies gaps in content and generates tasks such as “create new tree,” “populate sub-page” or “rename file resources” could potentially drive any on-the-ball web editor wild. 2. Giving Feedback on Site Health The AI site doctor identifies dead pages that don’t bring in traffic, flags up broken links and sends alerts when images and videos don’t display correctly. 3. Supporting Governance and Good Practice These are currently rule-based. True AI would be bold enough to give recommendations such as “Your image and video sizes are not optimized for mobile devices” or “Your page doesn’t convert on Galaxy 5.” 4. Speeding up A/B Testing AI tools can get faster results than conventional A/B testing. Imagine if you could simultaneously test different permutations of page and component variants. Instead of running one test at a time, monitoring the traffic and doing the analysis, you could mix several tests at once and let AI get the results for you. 5. Chatting and Messaging AI-powered chatbots abound across sectors to provide customer support or get specific tasks done. Why shouldn’t there be one for your CMS?  So you could say, “Hey Webcrawler, I could resize this image in that content app, but why can’t I do it in this field?” And the all-knowing Webcrawler would find the answer for you, or even generate a ticket to your IT or devops support team. 6. Talking to Other AIs Right now, AIs tend to be set up within relatively closed environments. What if they could talk to one another? “I’m trying to pull a feed from your website, but the format is not compatible and it’s not working. Can you fix on your end?” Could we be seeing the next escalation of spyware and business intelligence? Still a Ways to Go with Artificial Intelligence AI is based on predictable behaviors. But human behaviors are not always predictable or rational, and the subtleties vary across cultures.  One of the basics of content management is a consistent user interface or author experience. AI cannot create that. It cannot convey personal experiences or spin engaging stories. However, once the tone is set, it could possibly mimic and replicate. And talking to robots can be frustrating. My recent encounter with a chat service saw me going in rounds because the mechanized responses just couldn’t understand my human impatience to solve the problem out of the box, out of the rules that they have learnt. I’ve always been an advocate of the best-of-breed approach in selecting a CMS for your enterprise. So it’s no surprise that I believe the ideal solution lies in the combination of human and artificial intelligence.  Let science and technology be the backbone of making your content and engagement robust. Robots can reduce or take over repeated tasks that stretch over lots of data, tasks that can be automated or follow a logical roadmap, recurring tasks that are activated by specific actions and are time-consuming.  But let the emotional storytelling and social insights come from humans with all their complexities and imperfections. A marketer cannot plough through millions of blog posts daily. Use AI tools to track good keywords and popular topics. Then use the human touch to spin the tale. AI won’t kill content management, at least, not in the foreseeable future. But it will challenge content management to become better at its core competence: asking the right questions of developers, authors and marketers, building compelling user stories, connecting AI applications, and knowing how to dock onto the raw data to create a strategy that resonates.

This also increases the rate of conversion of visitors to customers. This means even more revenue for you. You need a professional team that delivers top quality whiteboard animation videos at the lowest prices. “High-quality video is essential, so do not sacrifice quality for cost,” cautions Melissa Rayman, head of the creative team at 345AnimaltionVideo. “You need a professional team that delivers top quality whiteboard animation videos at the lowest prices.” Animation Videos have increased sales by up to 347%, which means more money in your pocket. 345AnimationVideos offers the top-notch designs, professional voice recordings, and full HD video.

Google today detailed Lumin, a mobile tour that uses Tango and its augmented reality to enrich a museum visit. Lumin was built by the Detroit Institute of Arts and GuidiGO, and when you go to the DIA, you can head to the front desk and ask for a Lenovo Phab 2 Pro to explore the museum with Tango. With the Phab 2 Pro and Tango, you can do things like see inside of a mummy’s sarcophagus and bandages to view the skeleton beneath them and see what the colorful limestone relief of Mesopotamia would’ve looked when it was first created.   Google says that it’s working to bring Tango to more museums around the world. This is a great use for Google’s Tango platform. With its augmented reality features, you can use Tango to get a lot more out of exhibits, helping you to better understand what you’re looking at and learn more in the process.

As a matter of fact, Silicon Valley formed an official VR division inside their secretive walls. The company has also appointed Clay Bavor as the division’s head. Google’s VR platform manufactured by Huawei and dubbed “Daydream” is now in full swing. Daydream VR headset is expected to hit the market in early November this year. On the other hand, it appears that Google and Samsung are now officially in a competition with Oculus. Samsung, Oculus, and Google are now direct competitors when it comes to mobile VR market. As a matter of fact, Google is expanding their library of VR headsets powered by smartphones. This expansion is made possible through the revelation of a second headset created by Huawei. Huawei VR Also Known As ‘Daydream’ For those who are unaware, Huawei is a Chinese electronics giant, who will play a massive role in the VR industry. Furthermore, Google made it clear that Daydream would be a VR platform that other manufacturers would participate in with their own hardware eventually. In addition, Huawei is going to be the very first partner OEM that will join Google in VR market competition. The new VR headset was announced through Google’s blog post which can be accessed here. In the said blog post, Google announced that they have a bigger suite of Daydream ready products. In addition, the blog post has also explained the specs of the said Huawei VR headset thoroughly. Huawei VR Headset Release Date According to Google’s blog post, Huawei has been pushing the Daydream-ready VR headset to be launched at a later date. Unfortunately, the blog post didn’t include an exact release date of the said VR headset. On the positive side, the blog post made it clear that the said VR headset is very easy to use. In the blog post, it is stated that it will have an adjustable focus. Hence, people can use it without the need for prescription glasses. In addition, it will provide the user a 95-degree field of view. Google explained that they want to give the consumers more choice in how they want to enjoy Virtual reality. In this case, they will do it by bringing their new VR headsets into the Daydream platform.

Monday was a very momentous day because of important milestones for Apple and Nokia (no, not the one you knew, the new one). Read below to know the day’s top stories. Nokia 6 launched, available only in China As we mentioned above, HMD Global, the company that’s taken control of the famous brand name from yesteryears, has launched the Nokia 6. Well, technically the launch happened on Sunday, but it's big enough that we wanted to make sure you don't miss the development. The Nokia 6 will be sold only in China at approximately Rs. 17,000 (when converted). It is a mid-range Android phone built out of premium materials and a typical feature set. We think it’s going to have a hard time competing with more value-for-money Android phones, but clearly there's more to a phone than just specifications so let's see how things pan out. In related news, a ‘Nokia E1’, which looking at the rumoured specs appears to be positioned lower than the Nokia 6, was seen in rough sketches and leaked images. iPhone celebrates 10th anniversary On 9th January 2007, ten years ago, Steve Jobs showed the world the first iPhone. It changed the smartphone industry massively - stylus-bound screens were replaced with finger-friendly, intuitive user interfaces. The need to buy a separate digital camera lessened as smartphones doubled up as our point-and-shoots. The concept of app stores made app discovery easy, and created many new business in the process. The ‘10th anniversary iPhone’ is supposedly going to be special, if you go by rumours or even what Tim Cook hinted today. Let’s hope it’s worth the wait. Samsung Gear wearables will now work with an iPhone In 2013, the original Samsung Gear smartwatch restricted to work only with Samsung phones. Subsequent Gear wearables added support to Android phones made by other manufacturers. Now, the Tizen operating system-based Gear S3, Gear S2, and Gear Fit2 will also work with an iPhone. The Gear S app already available on the iOS app store will enable this. Google’s Android Wear platform have been working with iOS devices since 2015. Whereas the Apple Watch, expectedly, only works with the iPhone. Lenovo phone with 5100mAh battery to be launched on Wednesday The Lenovo P2 is slated to launch on Wednesday exclusively on e-commerce platform Flipkart. First seen at IFA 2016, this phone promises a good battery life thanks to a massive 5100mAh battery pack. Other specifications include Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, 3 or 4GB RAM and 32 or 64GB of internal storage. Check out more details. Xiaomi’s Mi Bunny is a voice assistant for kids Other than the razor-thin Mi TV 4 and the white edition of the Mi Mix, Xiaomi also announced a voice assistant in the form of a kid’s toy - the Mi Bunny. It comes with the Chinese company’s in-house voice assistant service, that can send and receive messages on WeChat, a popular instant messenger in China. It’s also priced reasonably at just $29 (roughly Rs. 2,000). Nokia’s virtual assistant may be called ‘Viki’ In a bid to compete with Google Assistant, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa and Samsung Bixby, Nokia has registered the name ‘Viki’ as a trademark in the European Union with the following description - "software for the creation and monitoring of mobile and Web digital assistants working with knowledge and combining all data sources into a single chat and voice based interface”. Sounds pretty much like a digital assistant to us. We had spoken of how Google’s Pixel phones are going to cause more software fragmentation in Android, and it is very apparent now. Here’s hoping the newly-launched Nokia 6 and other Android phones can get this feature via a software update, whenever HMD intends to launch it. HTC’s U series phones to be revealed on January 12 HTC has decided to let the CES 2017 buzz settle down, as it’s hosting the ‘For U’ event on 12th January, where it is expected to launch multiple smartphones. The HTC U Ultra, U Play, and X10 are rumoured to be the handsets launched at this event, as well as a HTC Vive branded smartphone, which was seen in a leaked promotional video. The flagship U Ultra is said to be a thin device with a metal body and rounded edges, and will come with record-breaking camera performance. HTC is also the equipment manufacturer for Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones, which also have been praised for their camera quality. Three iPads could come Q2 2017, but no iPad mini refresh? Information from the supply chain suggests Apple could be launching three new iPad models in the second quarter of 2017. It is said that along with an updated 12.9 inch iPad Pro, Apple will be bringing out new iPad Pro models with screen sizes between 10 and 10.5 inches. The company will keep a 9.7 inch iPad as the entry level option, potentially suggesting the end of the road for the iPad mini. In other Apple news pertaining to India, the company is said to be meeting top officials from the IT and finance ministries in January, to discuss demands for setting up a manufacturing unit in the country. Nintendo Switch may cost $250 A report from Japan’s financial newspaper Nikkei suggests that the much-anticipated portable and home gaming console, Nintendo Switch, may end up costing $250 (roughly Rs. 17,000) for buyers, when it is officially unveiled on January 12. The price may have been decided owing to the same price point of previous Nintendo consoles. In related news, pricing of compatible accessories has leaked too.

The minivans, built in collaboration with Fiat Chrysler, are Chrysler Pacifica hybrids outfitted with Waymo’s own suite of sensors and radar. Waymo and FCA announced their partnership in May. In a speech at the Detroit auto show Sunday, CEO John Krafcik revealed Waymo built the sensors, radar and software for the new minivans itself. Krafcik said the company felt the system would work better if it was developed specifically for self-driving instead of using off-the-shelf parts. “A single integrated system means that all the different parts of a self-driving car work together seamlessly,” Krafcik said. Waymo also was able to significantly lower the cost of the system, Krafcik said. The rooftop lidar — which uses lasers to give the car a three-dimensional picture of the world — cost $75,000 a few years ago. Waymo has brought that cost down by 90 percent and has developed its own short-range and long-range lidar. Waymo’s long-range lidar can see a football helmet two football fields away. Krafcik didn’t say exactly how Waymo lowered the costs. But the announcement could concern suppliers like Velodyne, which makes lidar systems used by Ford Motor Co. and others, and Delphi Corp., which is developing its own autonomous driving system. Stephanie Brinley, an auto analyst for IHS Markit, said Google won’t control the market for self-driving technology, so other suppliers with go ahead with development of their own systems. But some smaller players in the nascent industry are “going to fall away,” she said. Waymo has repeatedly said that it doesn’t plan to build its own cars, but provide self-driving systems to established carmakers, car-sharing services or others. In addition to FCA, Honda Motor Co. recently announced that it’s in talks with Waymo about using its technology in Honda vehicles. Krafcik said Waymo, which has been developing self-driving cars for eight years, expects to reach 3 million miles of test-driving this May.

Its latest move is to take in-house the design of the sensor packages on which its fully self-driving vehicle platform relies. Waymo CEO John Krafcik announced the move at the Automobili-D motor show in Detroit on Sunday, while showing off the latest incarnation of the self-driving Pacifica minivans the company has developed with auto maker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). "These Pacifica minivans will be the first vehicles to be equipped with Waymo's all-new fully integrated hardware suite and we've brought our self-driving sensors now in-house. It's all designed and built from the ground up by Waymo, with every part manufactured with just one goal in mind: To safely handle the complex task of full autonomy," Krafcik told the audience. When it became a stand-alone company last year, Waymo moved away from earlier plans to build a bubble-shaped self-driving vehicle of its own, deciding instead to work with other automobile makers to get its package of software and hardware on the road. It is already working with FCA and Honda to do that, Krafcik said Sunday. While other companies are demonstrating self-driving capabilities in certain circumstances -- on lane-separated highways or in slow-moving urban traffic, for example -- Krafcik emphasized that Waymo's goal is a totally autonomous vehicle. "An almost self-driving car, what one might call aspirational autonomy, simply won't cut it," he said. The Pacifica on stage, on the other hand, brought together several firsts, he said. "It's the world's first self-driving minivan capable of getting you door to door without a person at the wheel. It's also the first product of our first collaboration with an auto maker working on a mass-production platform." The Pacificas will be driving themselves on public roads beginning in Arizona and California later this month, he said. Among the benefits of bringing sensor design in house is a reduction in cost, Krafcik told media present at the show. That has allowed Waymo to bring the cost of a key component, the lidar (light direction and range) sensor, down from US$75,000 each in 2009 to $7,500 today, he said.

Google Brings Tango Augmented Reality Technology to Museums GO Explore the wonders of the world from your couch Jan 9, 2017 16:52 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  A myriad of Tango-enabled smartphones were announced last week at Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, United States. Many more devices are likely to be introduced throughout the year, which clearly points to the fact that Google is strongly backed by many Android OEMs in its endeavor to make Tango technology available to a larger audience. Along with the announcement that more smartphones will be Daydream-ready soon, Google expanded the use of Tango location and augmented reality technology to museums. “Museums can be great teachers. From art and science to culture and natural history, they educate and inspire us. Still, display signs and audio guides can only convey so much. What if you could explore museums in a different way?” says Justin Quimby, Senior Product Manager, Tango. Using Tango AR technology, users will soon be able to explore museums around the world in a whole new way. The first museum that Tango AR users will be able to visit virtually is the Detroit Institute of Arts. Ishtar Gate - Ancient Babylonia Google announced that, in partnership with GuidiGO, the Detroit Institute of Arts built Lumin, a mobile tour that uses Tango capabilities to add AR interactivity and information to make the exploring experience more immersive. Using the Tango enabled Lenovo Phab 2 Pro smartphone, users will be able to explore a wide range of works, including mummies of the Ancient Egypt, the Ishtar Gate of the Ancient Babylonia, as well as the limestone reliefs of Mesopotamia. According to Google, “this is just the beginning of how you’ll be able to use Tango in museums to see more, hear more and learn more. Stay tuned as we bring Tango to even more museums around the world.” If you don't own a Tango-enabled smartphone, you will be able to get one from the museum's front desk. All museum partners will be “outfitted” with Tango-enabled smartphones for visitors who want to explore the museums of the world.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Tango smartphone#Lenovo Phab 2 Pro#Tango AR#Tango location#Tango-enabled museum subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Adds More Phones to Daydream Family Including Asus ZenFone AR, ZTE Axon 7 Asus Announces ZenFone AR, First Tango-Enabled and Daydream-Ready Phone Tango-Enabled Asus ZenFone AR Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm Asus Smartphone with 4,850 mAh Battery Spotted Ahead of Official Announcement It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs Linux Kernel 4.9.4 Released with Various ARM/ARM64 and Networking Improvements 2 photos    Mummy - Ancient Egypt New Android APKs imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Samsung Unveils the Galaxy C7 Pro, Pre-Orders Start on January 16 more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The announcement came from John Krafcik, head of Google's Waymo unit, whose search for partners to develop and install the company's autonomous driving technology into real cars has so far yielded only an alliance with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI)(FCAU.N) and a pending deal with Honda Motor Co (7267.T). Headlining a future mobility conference during the show's media preview, Krafcik said Waymo's latest set of self-driving hardware and software incorporated a new array of sensors, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar, all developed and built in-house. Krafcik said Waymo had reduced the cost of a single lidar unit by 90 percent, to about $7,500. Among major outside suppliers of this technology, Velodyne Lidar Inc and Quanergy Systems Inc both have said they are developing smaller solid-state lidar units that eventually would cost $200 or less. Waymo's existing test fleet of self-driving cars, including some specially equipped Lexus RX450s and Google's own "Firefly" prototypes, has accumulated nearly 2.5 million miles in less than eight years, mostly on city streets. Krafcik said Waymo planned to test the first self-driving Pacificas this month on public roads in California and Arizona. He did not say when the system would be ready to install in production vehicles. Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH.N) and Mobileye NV (MBLY.N) have said they are collaborating on a self-driving system that could be sold to automakers beginning in 2019. Ford Motor Co (F.N), General Motors Co (GM.N) and BMW AG (BMWG.DE) have said they intend to introduce self-driving cars in 2021.

To do that, we have to oversee both the self-driving software and self-driving hardware' Nick Ismail Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, which was formerly known as the Google Self Driving Car Project, will begin testing its driverless technology in Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Minivans, modified through a partnership with Fiat-Chrysler. The company was formally launched by Google in December. Road tests are poised begin later this month and its autonomous driverless technology will produce lowers costs for key components and improve the reliability of self-driving. >See also: The future of driverless cars and data security “Our latest innovations have brought us closer to scaling our technology to potentially millions of people every day,” said John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo. Indeed Krafcik said that cost of a package of LIDAR sensors and radar in a car has fallen by more than 90%, from an initial $75,000. The cheaper and more efficient technology will “see small people and objects close to the car, and spot tiny objects far away, too,” Krafcik said. “We’re serious about creating full self-driving cars that can help millions of people. To do that, we have to oversee both the self-driving software and self-driving hardware.” The road tests are due to take place in California and Arizona, Waymo will start testing its technology. According to Waymo, this is the next step in its six year journey that has seen the Google self-driving car go from limited drives in a small number of modified Lexus SUV’s, to testing a fleet of vehicles on public roads across four states. The company’s confidence stems from its claim that the self-driving technology is now performing four times better in 2017 than it was this time last year. >See also: The inevitable road to the autonomous car: are they safe? “The Waymo self-driving program is the first true end-to-end integrated solution that we see in the market today,” said Arunprasad Nandakumar, a tech analyst with Frost & Sullivan. “In the coming months, the Waymo minivan will give clearer indications on whether the industry will be able to meet the steep targets that have been publicly announced by various players.” Related Topics autonomous technology Google Self-driving minivans Waymo Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Read More Latest Popular A consensus on consumer data is needed How to manage big data in the age of digital Customer feedback is key to product improvements Have you been caught unawares by the EU GDPR? 2017: the year of real applications Women in IT Awards 2017 – finalists revealed The smart nation: Singapore’s masterplan The path to manageable data Wine cellar, swimming pool and a treehouse: Inside Zoopla’s new office Rolling into the digital age: inside Rolls-Royce’s tech transformation Products Information Age Magazine Since its launch in 1995, Information Age has been regarded as one of the most respected technology titles in the B2B realm.

What is Android Things? Google launches its own Internet of Things platform to take on Apple’s HomeKit What is Android Things? With the Internet of Things in its infancy, Google has released a new software platform for developers. So what is Android Things? We take a quick look at what delights it offers. We take a look at Google's newly announced IoT software platform By Martyn Casserly | 09 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Google recently announced the release of a new IoT (Internet of Things) platform that utilises the power of Android and will allow developers to easily create new smart devices. Android Things is its name and there’s a real chance that the platform could be a very big deal. We take a quick look at what is Android Things and why it matters. Related: Rethinking Security for the Internet of Things | 12 Best smart heating systems 2017 |  Google Home preview What is the Internet of Things? There’s been a lot of talk about IoT over the past few years. This is due to the fact that technology has now reached a point where small, low power, internet enabled circuitry can be cheaply integrated into a number of products. This explains the growth in internet security cameras, door locks, thermostats, lights and, yes, even smart fridges. The principle of the IoT is that these products use the web to communicate with each other and their owner (usually via a smartphone app) and take care of simple tasks automatically or via remote commands. Essentially it allows you to turn on the heating before you arrive home or be reminded to pick up some milk because you’re running low. Of course Red Dwarf did warn us of a future where we were terrorised by talking toasters, but hopefully we have heeded those lessons well. There are still a few fundamentals to be worked out as the IoT becomes a mainstream reality, principle of which is what software platforms the various devices will support. Google’s release of the Android Things developer beta will be welcome news to those who prefer the Android way of life, while Apple’s already prevalent Homekit option currently caters for those with iOS devices. There will no doubt be a fair amount of crossover in regards of products, but the real ground will be taken by those who make it easy and profitable for devices to be made and run on their side of the fence. See also: Apple Home release date and rumours What is Android Things? | What does it do and who is it for? Android Things enables Android developers to create new smart devices that use Google’s existing services and Android APIs to accomplish tasks. This is bolstered by Google providing regular security updates for the platform. Intially the supported hardware will include Intel Edison, NXP Pico, and Raspberry Pi 3, all of which - according to Google - can be scaled up to large production runs. The new software builds on Google’s previous IoT project Brillo,  incorporating several useful tools from that experience. These include  Google Play Services, Google Cloud Platform, Android Studio, and the Android Software Development Kit. The company is also updating the Weave platform to make it easier for devices to connect to the cloud and interact with the new central part of the Google smart system - Google Assistant. There are already a number of big name companies adopting Weave - including Belkin WeMo, TP-Link, Philips Hue, Honeywell, and LiFX - so we would expect to see some Android Things enabled products appearing before too long and focussed on the Smart Home market.  It’s good to see Google focussing on the IoT area, as it feels a very natural place for the search giant’s expertise to really shine. Now a great first step would be to release Google Home in the UK so we can all get a taste for the cloud based world of tomorrow.

Featuresby Robert Triggs6 days ago 16 408 9 Amazon’s “artificial intelligence” software or should we say smart assistant, Alexa, was the quiet star of CES 2017, appearing in a huge range of products, from fridges to smart lamps, to cars. Alexa has even made its debut in its first smartphone, the Huawei Mate 9 – Alexa, and this could be the start of a new trend in 2017 that sees smart assistants become important flagship differentiators. Of course, Google and Apple have been at this for a long time already, and Google Now is already baked in to every new Android smartphone release these days. So really the age of the smart assistant has been here for a while already. However, Google Now certainly isn’t a unique selling point for manufacturers looking to stand out in the competitive high-end market, hence why custom assistants are starting to pop up. Furthermore, vendors are looking for ways to tie in other services and in turn sell more products. Just look at the growing scope of Alexa’s third party app support if you want an indication of where other assistants may be heading. AI developers like Amazon and Microsoft are deliberately designing their systems to be more easily integrated into third party products. So who’s at it? Well, a lot of the big brands. Huawei with Alexa, Xiaomi has partnered up with Microsoft’s Cortana and other apps with the launch of its Mi Mix concept phone, and even the first two OnePlus handsets saw a similar Cortana update of their own last year. We can probably expect others to take up similar licensing options, as AI developers like Amazon and Microsoft are deliberately designing their systems to be more easily integrated into third party products. Nokia also looks to be prepping its own assistant named Viki, although the company hasn’t announced any official details. See also: Amazon Echo commands – our guide to everything Alexa can do 4 weeks ago This arrangement looks to be a win win situation, with vendors receiving powerful software with which to sell consumers on, while the AI developers profit from selling products and collecting information. Not to mention that the more data collected and analyzed for use with these assistants, the more useful and intelligent they can become. So there’s a big incentive to branch out and put AI into as many consumer’s hands as possible as early as possible. Alexa is designed for the smart home, so it’s going to take some time before it catches up with Google when it comes to smartphone functionality. These efforts aren’t just coming from software developers though, some smartphone OEMs are developing their own virtual assistants as well, leading to even greater diversity in the market place. Huawei’s new Honor Magic comes sporting its own AI as part of the company’s new Magic Live UI. Even the new Google Assistant is acting as a lure to the Pixel and Pixel XL over picking the regular Google Now experience available on other handsets. It’s hard to believe that Google Assistant will remain a Pixel exclusive for long, but it is a compelling feature that’s helping the handset sell. Perhaps most importantly though, Samsung is also heavily rumored to be working on its own smart assistant known as Bixby. Samsung agreed to purchase Viv from the makers of Siri back in October of 2016. According to reports, Bixby will be heavily integrated into Samsung’s app suite that will come packaged with the Galaxy S8. This tight integration will enable Bixby to search for specific pictures using the Gallery app, as well as sifting through contacts, calendar dates, emails, and the other functions that we’ve come to expect from services like Google. Those heavily tied in to particular ecosystems may find that Alexa, Bixby, etc, just don't play nicely with the services that they're used to. Speaking of which though, the downside of this diversification in virtual assistants is that of software compatibility. We’re used to Google Now working with Google’s apps, but support from other smart assistants is not guaranteed. For example, Alexa works with Google Calendar but currently only US and UK customers can link Alexa to Gmail by using IFTTT, and that’s not a complete out of the box solution. Of course, Alexa supports a range of third party services that Google currently doesn’t, so there are going to be pros and cons to each software package. See also: Google Assistant to hit supported TVs and set-top boxes in the coming months 2 weeks ago Those heavily tied in to particular ecosystems may find that Alexa, Bixby, etc, just don’t play nicely with the services that they use the most or that they’re used to. For Samsung and the like, perhaps the hope is that consumers will move over to their supported services, but consumers are often reluctant to ditch apps that they’ve become reliant on. This could be a big risk for manufacturers who chose to ditch Google’s popular software in favor of their own more tightly integrated solutions. The bottom line is that we’re almost certainly going to see a variety of virtual assistant flavors hit the smartphone market throughout 2017, and we can expect manufacturers to spend a lot of time talking about them too. Ultimately though there’s no strict need for AI in a smartphone. It’s going to boil down to how useful and well integrated into other services these assistants are that determines whether or not consumers end up loving them, or if AI become just a meaningless buzzword. We perhaps shouldn’t expect miracles from first generation assistants, but the future could be quite interesting indeed.

Next: All PayPal accounts were 1 click away from hijacking by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Remember back in 2013, when Ticketmaster – the world’s largest online ticket retailer – decided to stop torturing people’s eyeballs by making them decipher blobs of melted characters in order to prove that they’re human? Likewise, Google’s now too stabbing a fork into CAPTCHA, the aggravating test that’s supposed to determine if we’re robots or scripts used by spammers or other online misdeed-doers, or if we are instead real, live, warm-blooded simians. CAPTCHA came out of Carnegie Mellon University and stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”. The tests are designed to be hard for robots, easy for humans. They typically consist of typing letters and/or digits from a distorted image. Or, as the case may be, messages to go pleasure yourself. Or, then again, mathematical problems that make your brain bleed. Ten years into using CAPTCHA to keep robots from engaging in dirty tricks online, the “supposed to weed out bots” has now turned into “utterly stink at weeding out bots”. That’s because advances in Artificial Intelligence have resulted in robot creations that are now able to solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text with 99.8% accuracy, according to Google’s recent research. Not that Google’s going to stop testing site visitors to weed out bots, mind you. Rather, as it announced on Wednesday, Google’s going to move away from asking users to read blobby text and type it into a box, as it’s been doing, like this:  And instead will simply ask us, “Are you a robot?” with what it’s calling the “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” API, like so: Asking us to check off a box saying that “I am not a robot” will be an effective way of determining whether or not we’re robots because humans move their cursors in a humanlike way. Specifically, the difference between bot and human can be revealed in clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves a mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button, according to Vinay Shet, the product manager for Google’s Captcha team. Without realizing it, humans also drop clues that can establish whether we’re automated or not: IP addresses and cookies show our movements elsewhere on the Web and can help prove that we’re not a bad actor. Wired quotes Shet: All of this gives us a model of how a human behaves It's a whole bag of cues that make this hard to spoof for a bot. He said that there are other variables that will help make the determination, but those have to be kept secret, lest botmasters figure out how to work around them and once again learn how to slip past Google’s filters. Google’s been integrating automated bot-detection into its CAPTCHAs since at least 2013. In October 2013, Google revealed that it had developed what it called its Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA to filter out bots. The backend doesn’t just look at whatever gobbledygook we type into the box. Rather, it observes our entire engagement with a CAPTCHA, from start to finish – before, during, and after we type into the box – to determine whether we’re carbon-based. On Valentine’s Day, Google gave us a taste of what reCAPTCHA can do, presenting us with chocolates and flowers and throbbing hearts – the first two of which were rendered in text that was simple (for humans) to read. It sounds great, but it’s not yet time to kiss the inscrutably distorted CAPTCHA blobs goodbye. Over the past week, Google’s tests on sites that use CAPTCHA have verified most humans, but it still missed quite a few. As Wired reports, about 60% of WordPress users and 80% of users at video game sales site Humble Bundle got past the CAPTCHA with only the simple checkbox. When Google’s Advanced Risk Analysis engine can’t figure out what we are with a mere click, it’s going to back up the test with a pop-up window that will present users with the same old distorted text we’ve been enduring for years. For mobile users, things haven’t gotten quite so simple as a single click. But when they face a CAPTCHA on their mobile phone or tablet, they’ll now have a much easier hurdle to leap: rather than having to type in text, they’ll be asked to select all the images that correspond with a clue image. Like Google says, it’s a lot easier to tap photos of cats or turkeys than to type in a line of text on a phone: And if you’re worried about the privacy implications of Google analyzing where your mouse moves on a page, Shet pointed out that Google will only be tracking your movements over the CAPTCHA widget when it appears on other sites, not on the entire page. This is how he put it to Wired: You don’t have to verify your identity to verify your humanity. Besides, as we’ve noted before, tracking movement is not just a Google thing. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail or any webpage can track everything you do and could be keylogging your every pointer movement or keystroke. Logging keystrokes is no super secret, privacy-sucking vampire sauce. It’s plain old Web 1.0. This is not news, but it’s certainly worth repeating: anybody with a website can capture what you type, as you type it, if they want to. The reality is that JavaScript, the language that makes this kind of monitoring possible, is both powerful and ubiquitous. It’s a fully featured programming language that can be embedded in web pages, and all browsers support it. It’s been around almost since the beginning of the web, and the web would be hurting without it, given the things it makes happen. Among the many features of the language are the abilities to track the position of your cursor, track your keystrokes and call “home” without refreshing the page or making any kind of visual display. Those aren’t intrinsically bad things. In fact, they’re enormously useful. Without those sort of capabilities sites like Facebook and Gmail would be almost unusable, searches wouldn’t auto-suggest and Google Docs wouldn’t save our bacon in the background. In the case of Google’s advances with reCAPTCHA, such an ability can stop a lot of bad bots from doing things that can be worse than the annoyance of having to endure typing in text from a blobby image. Think bots that harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages, site scrapers that grab the content of websites and re-use it without permission on automatically generated doorway pages, bots that take part in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and more. I’ll take the kittens, please!

In the era where the mouse is becoming obsolete Google are going to rely on user mouse movements or clicks to define whether a person is human or not. There are some pretty big gaming communities that have been scripting human like mouse behavior for years. It’ll be interesting to see how this progresses.

Too ambiguous for me. I recall getting one of “click all the sandwiches” and after many failures I realized that in the USA a hamburger is called a sandwich. Reply Paul Ducklin says: September 9, 2016 at 5:40 pm I thought a hamburger was called “a hamburger” in the US :-) By definition, of course, even in British English, a hamburger *is* a sandwich. At any rate, there seems to be no suggestion in any of the Oxford lexicons (British or American) that sandwiches can’t be circular. Two pieces of bread with an edible filling in between is all you need to pass the test. I guess the CAPTCHA folks were hoping a robot wouldn’t be able to handle the subtleties… Having said that, if you tried to order a hamburger by asking for “a sandwich” in Maccas, I think you would get, errrrrrrr, either a sandwich, served in the form of a square cut into two triangle, or a word from the security guard (depending on how strongly you argued the case, and whether it was after 1am).

While it may not be building its own car, Google continues to develop the technology that’s going to be deployed in collaboration with other car manufacturers. It has been working with Chrysler on one such project and has confirmed at the North American International Auto Show that the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans will be rolled out on public roads for the first time later this month. The first fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans will be rolled out in Mountain View, California and Phoenix, Arizona. Google’s self-driving Lexus SUVs have already racked up thousands of miles in these locations. Waymo is doing things differently now. Google’s self-driving car spin-off confirmed that it’s building all of the technology to enable the car to drive itself in-house. It’s not purchasing parts off the shelf, so to speak, it’s actually building all of the sensors, cars, and mapping equipment that’s vital for an autonomous car to function. This enables the company to bring down the manufacturing cost and have more control over the essential hardware. Waymo CEO John Krafcik revealed during his speech that the company had cut its costs by 90 percent so the same sensors that Google bought for $75,000 a few years ago are now being built by Waymo itself for just $7,500. Waymo is not looking to be an auto parts supplier like Delphi which is also working on autonomous cars. It will continue to form partnerships with other car manufacturers to further the cause of cars that are capable of driving themselves. Filed in Transportation..

But you have to rethink that, because Waymo, the self-driving car startup project from Google, is ready to release the Chrysler Pacifica minivans. Waymo is a self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around. Without a driver! But, there are some fascinating facts about Google’s project, Waymo. The company created sensors to go along with the self-driving software. And Chrysler was more than happy incorporate the software to its Hybrid Pacifica minivan. So at the end of January a fleet of 100 will begin cruising. On a sidenote the company has tested its technology on nearly 2.5 million miles of road. That’s a lot of testing. The autonomous fleet minivans will hit the roads in Mountain View, California and Phoenix, Arizona. John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive said at a speech: “Today we can imagine our self-driving technology being applied in a variety of ways: personal transportation, ride hailing, logistics, last-mile solutions for public transport, just to name a few.” And some people might be sceptical about the newest project powered by Google, because the company put a halt to its self-driving vehicle. But, the fact that Waymo appeared pretty quickly after the announcement show us that Google is not ready to abandon that dream.   And let’s not forget that Google started to experiment with self-driving technology back in 2009, and Krafcik said the sensors unveiled Sunday are the latest addition of that research and development. Another fascinating factor is that Waymo’s system allows the car to “see” its 360-degree surroundings. That system will help the car to navigate accordingly using LIDAR sensors that send out millions of laser points each second and eighth “vision modules” that construct a high-resolution picture. Also, a radar tracks down objects as they move around the car. John Krafcik said about the technology: “It’s a virtuous cycle,” “Better hardware gives us better data to develop our software; and as our software become more sophisticated, we get better at optimizing the most important aspects of our hardware.” Finally building both the hardware and the software cuts down the cost. Krafcik noted that the company was shaving 90 percent off its costs.   Share the joy                 Share this: Reddit Email Facebook Skype Twitter Tumblr Google LinkedIn More Pinterest Author: Martha Papadimitriou Martha is a journalist, a blog writer, a mother and a bookworm.

You are here: Blog Share 9 January, 2017 Four key features to appreciate about Google Trips By Nikki Gilliland @ Econsultancy 0 comments Google has been increasing its focus on travel for a while now. Along with recent updates to its online airfare comparison tool, Google Flights (which now tells users the cheapest times to book tickets), it’s also launched its first native app in the sector.  Google Trips is designed to be every traveller’s ‘personal tour guide’ – but what sets it apart from other travel apps? Here’s a look at some of its key features. Organisation in one place While Google Flights wants to disrupt sites like Kayak and Skyscanner (i.e. the places people go to book), Google Trips aims to take the reins immediately after this point, helping travellers to plan and organise their holidays. Once users sign in using their Gmail accounts, the app provides a list of past trips as well as future ones, keeping things like hotel and flight details all in one place.  As you might expect, with the same style and design of Google's 'Nearby' search funtion, it's pretty easy to use. And this convenience appears to be one of its biggest selling points – not to mention a reason existing Google account holders might naturally feel inclined to download the app. With more than 1bn monthly active users, Gmail gives Trips a ready and waiting audience. So unlike other travel apps such as TripAdvisor or Lonely Planet, it offers the unbeatable incentive of tapping into a service many of us already use and adding a whole heap of extras on top.   Inspiration  Curating travel plans is not Google Trips’ only draw. It’s also designed to offer inspiration, using its ‘Things to Do’ feature to offer a wealth of information about hotspots, restaurants and pretty much everything you need to know about an area. The amount of detail offered is impressive. Again, unsurprising considering Google's gargantuan pool of data. Google has certainly covered all bases, ensuring users will reach for the app during both advanced planning and while in-the-moment. Users can map out daily itineraries, delving down into deeper information such as walking distances and even how long tourists typically spend in locations. There's also a nice real-time element, too. If you’re using it online, the app will update weather conditions, offer relevant suggestions and even give random recommendations if you fancy going off the beaten track.   Map integration and utility Another significant feature of Google Trips is the map function, which allows users to easily access Google Maps directly from the app.  This functional aspect is very welcome. While many people already use Google to discover nearby places, the tech giant is clearly hoping to be a one-stop travel shop, so to speak, joining the dots in the over-arching 'Google' user experience.   Offline feature Lastly, one of my favourite features in Google Trips is the fact that it can be used offline. Users have the option to download itineraries and information to refer to at a later date, solving the problem of international data charges - one reason many people fail to use travel apps while abroad. I've only recently discovered that Google Maps can actually be downloaded already - a fact which Google apparently doesn't like to advertise too much. With Google Trips, however, this comes to the forefront, with the feature being nicely highlighted to let users know that it is there. In conclusion... So, will Google Trips spell trouble for the likes of TripAdvisor? With popularity and loyalty towards the latter already being well-established, Google might have its work cut out convincing travellers that it can provide the same kind of knowledge and travel expertise. Likewise, let's not forget that Google Trips does not allow bookings from within the app, meaning the user experience will be disrupted at this point. Having said that, with its attention to detail, there's a lot to entice users back. Data is obviously where its real strengths lie, and combined with a familiar interface and easy-to-use design, it could mean a successful step up for Google's travel presence.

Huawei’s new headset was recently announced in a Google blogpost which detailed upcoming Daydream-ready devices.  As well as its headset, Huawei’s Mate 9 Pro and Porsche Design Mate 9 smartphones were also revealed to be joining the Daydream family. According to Google, Huawei’s headset has been “built to be easy to use” with “an adjustable focus so it can be used without eyeglasses.” Google vision Visually, Huawei’s headset is more reminiscent of Samsung’s Gear VR than Google’s Daydream View thanks to its white plastic build and focus dial. However, it appears the Huawei headset will have the benefit of compatibility with Google’s VR motion controller as it appears alongside the headset in the official images. Google launched the Daydream virtual reality platform along with its own Daydream View headset in November 2016, making Huwaei only the second company to release a Daydream-ready headset.  However, it certainly won’t be the last. Google has made it clear that though it has its own headset, Daydream is a platform and that by bringing new headsets  to the space it hopes “to give consumers even more choice in how they enjoy VR.” Huawei isn’t just adding to Google’s Daydream devices, though, it’s also adding a new smartphone to the Tango platform. At the moment, the number of devices using the Tango AR technology is very small, limited to the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro and Asus Zenfone AR, and there are only 36 Tango-compatible apps currently on the Google Play Store.   This hasn’t put Huawei off, though, and according to a report from Android Authority the company will release its own Tango-based smartphone in the near future. Other than that there are plans for it to exist, nothing is known about Huawei’s Tango phone - not even a codename.  However, it makes sense that if Huawei is planning to support the Daydream side of the Google VR department, it would also release products that would allow its users to make use of the Tango technology.  At the moment, there are no release dates or price points set for either Huawei’s Daydream headset or Tango smartphone but we’ll update as more information becomes available.  Interested in joining the VR revolution yourself?

The right GPU, Android N and above, and OLED display. There are others, but you need that spec for high performance. If you don’t, your latency is high enough that you’ll notice it, and that immersion is broken and that’s not a good experience.” Performance factor This means it’s not enough for a phone to have some high-specification components and not have others. To be Daydream ready a phone has to have the right combination of specifications; it could have the right processor but if it doesn’t have the right display, it’s not going to work.  This explains why Huawei’s Mate 9 won’t be Daydream compatible, but the Mate 9 Pro and Porsche Mate 9 will be – though the Mate 9 is a high-end smartphone, it has a Full HD display while the Pro and Porsche models have more suitable Quad HD displays.  As a result, though Google Daydream View is a relatively low-cost VR headset, it could be a long time before low-cost smartphones are able to use the Daydream technology.  Fortunately, Singh also said that Google is actively working with smartphone manufacturers to see if specification requirements can be tuned and changed in a way that will allow the list of Daydream-supported devices grow at a faster rate.  Daydream ready?

Buying on a budget doesn't have to entail a compromise. The 2015 Moto G is even now a magnificent budget phone, and there are plenty of other cheap phones in our round-up of the best budget phones you can buy in the UK in 2017. Best budget smartphone reviews. A little money can go a long way in the smartphone market. We round up the best phones under £150 By Chris Martin | 09 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments What is the best budget phone? Best budget phone RRP Key specifications Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) £149 Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, Snapdragon 410, 1/2GB RAM, 8/16GB storage, 5in HD, 2470mAh Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 £125 Android 5.0.2 Lollipop, Snapdragon 615, 2GB RAM, 16GB storage, 5.5in Full-HD, 3000mAh Vodafone Smart Prime 7 £75 Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Snapdragon 210, 1GB RAM, 8GB storage, 5in HD, 2540mAh Jump straight to our full best budget phone chart What's the best budget phone? The best cheap phone in the UK is the Moto G 3rd-gen after it's price cut, followed by the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6. Also check out the Smart Ultra 6 and the Xiaomi Redmi 3S as cheap alternatives. Read more about these phones and some top cheap phone alternatives in our best budget phones chart below. Plus: what to look for in a budget phone. Also see: Best Phone Deals In our experience the best way to get a cheap phone is to buy it SIM-free then grab a great-value SIM-only deal. You won't be paying £50-odd per month for a phone for the next two years, and you can swap it for a newer model whenever you fancy it and have the spare cash. All the phones in our best budget phones chart cost under £150, which is just a quarter of the price you'll pay for flagships such as the Galaxy S7, HTC 10 and LG G5 - also see Best phones 2017. If you are in the market for a budget phone, you'll quickly find that some of the best deals are sold via mobile operators. What you need to watch for is whether these phones are sold locked to that operator's network. This is the case with the best cheap phone on our list - the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 -  but if you don't want to become a Vodafone customer you should look further down the list for a non-network-branded handset, such as the Moto E. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017 We've rounded up some of the best network-unlocked phones here, and an alternative route to getting a cheap unlocked phone is to buy a Chinese phone, and you'll find some of these in our group test. You might not have heard of the brands, and they won't be available on the UK High Street (save for the likes of Huawei and ZTE), but Chinese phones are well-known for offering amazing specs for the money and undercutting their European rivals. In most cases you'll get a phone with a mid-range specification at a budget spec. Of course there are down sides, for example what should you do if a phone bought from China is faulty? We've rounded up the major pitfalls in our article on buying grey-market tech, but if you're still interested you should see our round-up of the best Chinese phones 2017. Ranked in order below are our reviews of what we consider to be the best budget phones on sale right now. We've based this chart on the SIM-free price, specifications and performance of each budget smartphone. You can click on a phone in which you're interested to read the full review, see example photos from the camera and benchmark results. Best budget smartphones: Buying advice If you're looking for a cheap phone, you have to accept the fact that the manufacturer is going to cut some corners to achieve that low price and you aren't going to get the same speed, features and quality of screen as you might with a phone costing two, three or even four times its price. It used to be the case that budget phones were instantly recognisable by their low-resolution displays, meagre amounts of storage and chunky, plastic bodies, but things are improving in this area all the time. These days, for £150 it's quite possible to buy a phone with a full-HD display and an 8mm body. Most will support 4G connectivity, but not all will support NFC (Chinese phones will often feature HotKnot in place of MediaTek and, although it's a similar technology, it isn't the same.) We've broken down some of the key areas of specifications below. There are two main operating systems that you will find on a budget smartphone: Google Android and Windows Phone 10. These operating systems will let you download the major apps such Facebook, Twitter, Skype, WhatsApp and more. However, if you want native Google apps including Gmail, YouTube, Maps and others, you should to opt for a smartphone running Android. Content continues below We like Windows Phone, but the choice of apps is more limited, especially when it comes to UK-specific ones and those for physical gadgets such as smart home devices. Also, apps may not have the same set of features that you get on Android. You can't download TV shows from BBC iPlayer on Windows Phone, for example. And that will be a deal-breaker for some people. Also see: Best sounding phone 2017. Best budget smartphones: What to look for in a cheap phone Budget phone processor At the moment we have a strange situation where some cheap phones have the same processor - and performance - as much more expensive phones. For example, the 4G version of the Motorola Moto E has the popular Snapdragon 410 CPU. Yet, there are lots of phones costing twice at much as the Moto E's price with exactly the same chip. What's important is not the benchmark results (they're a way to compare phones to see if one is better or worse than another) but whether they feel responsive in real-world use. You'll need to read our reviews to find out whether a phone performs well or not. Budget phone battery Battery life is also a factor in performance. However, there's isn't a great difference between the best and worst budget phones in this respect. They generally have similar size batteries which typically last a day (and a bit) in 'normal' use. Of course, if you use the phone for hours on end to browse the web, use it as a sat nav, play games or watch videos you'll find the battery might run out well before the day is out. Battery saver modes won't really help here, since the only modes which will significantly extend battery life will also prevent you from doing those things and limit use to phone calls and text messages. A plus point of budget phones when it comes to battery life is that they very often feature lower-resolution screens, which places less of a strain on the battery. Budget phone screen When it comes to screens, arguably the other component you should care about, there are some things to look out for. One is resolution. With screen sizes gradually increasing, low resolutions mean text and icons can look blocky and jagged. On a 5in screen, 1280x720 is the minimum you want, but higher is always better, and as we've mentioned you can find a full-HD screen at this price (don't expect Quad-HD). On smaller phones with, say, 4.5in screens, you can get away with 960x540, but you really can do better. Screen quality and brightness may not be so important to you, but it's worth checking our reviews to find out if a screen is particularly good or bad. Low brightness can make a screen difficult to view in bright sunlight. Budget phone cameras People's phones are increasingly their main camera, so it pays to choose a phone with the best possible camera for photos and videos. Cameras are the first items to be cut down in budget phones, so it's common to find low-quality, low-resolution sensors and lenses. We always take test photos and videos and explain whether they're any good or not in our reviews. What you can't do is to look at a camera's specifications and work out whether it will take good shots or not: the numbers are largely meaningless - although they can be a good guide to how capable a phone camera is going to be. If one manufacturer offers a 13Mp rear camera and another just 5Mp, it doesn't take a genius to expect better quality from the manufacturer who offers 13Mp. Just be sure to check that 13Mp camera is not actually an 8Mp camera using software interpolation to get to 13Mp. Don't overlook the front camera. It's rare not to get one at all if you're spending over £60, but quality varies hugely. Avoid anything with a very low VGA (640x480) resolution and aim for at least 1.2 or 2Mp. In many cases these days you can get 5Mp at this price. Numbers do matter at this level, as manufacturers often really skimp on the front camera, so if selfies or Skype chats are order of the day, choose a budget phone with a good front camera. Best budget phones: Software We've already mentioned the difference between Android and Windows Phone. Android is the best choice for most people, but be aware that manufacturers often add their own interfaces on top of Android. Google's own Nexus phones and Motorola's have 'plain' Android, but the rest are customised to greater or lesser degrees. Again, our reviews will give the specific details. Some of these interfaces have extra features worth having, or a replacement camera app that's much better than the stock Android one. Others take it too far and can also be sluggish and unresponsive. Going or a phone with plain Android generally means you'll get any updates faster, especially when a whole new version of Android comes out. It can be a wait of many months for other phones, or they may not get updates at all. Read next: Best new phones coming in 2017 Best budget phone reviews: 1. Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) Rating: Reviewed on: 18 May 16 RRP: From £149 inc VAT Compare: all Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) deals With various upgrades including a waterproof design, great cameras and stock Android, the new Moto G 2015 is a great affordable phone. The device is still a bit chunky and it's a shame to see the stereo speakers gone. It's worth opting for the model with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. Now with a price cut to £149, the Moto G 3rd-gen is the best budget phone you can buy. Read our Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) review. 2. Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 August 15 RRP: £125 Compare: all Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 deals The Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is worth its £125 price tag without a doubt. It's one of the best experiences we've had with a budget smartphone, and nothing about this phone suggests that it's budget apart from its price tag. Compared to the Smart Prime 6, this is definitely the better option to go for and we'd definitely pay the extra £50 for it – it's more powerful, has better cameras and a larger, higher quality display. It won't run the latest 3D mobile games but for every day use, it's a great phone and the fact that you can add up to 128GB of external storage means that there’s more storage than you can shake a stick at. Great work Vodafone. Read our Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 review. 3. Vodafone Smart Prime 7 Rating: Reviewed on: 29 June 16 RRP: £75 Pay as you go Compare: all Vodafone Smart Prime 7 deals We like the improved design of the Smart Prime 7 and Vodafone has even dropped the price, even if it is by £4. You get a decent phone for the money but we can't help but be a little disappointed by the downgrade to a Snapdragon 210 and that the camera is suddenly limited to 720p. Prime 6 owners have little reason to upgrade and although you can't go too wrong for just £75 you might be better off spending a little more on a better rival. Read our Vodafone Smart Prime 7 review. 4. Vodafone Smart Prime 6 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 June 15 RRP: £79 Compare: all Vodafone Smart Prime 6 deals The Vodafone Smart Prime 6 is a great budget smartphone that we think is worth more than the £79 that Vodafone asks for it. Its processor may not be able to compete with grey-market phones like the Doogee F1 Turbo Mini, but it handles day-to-day use just fine with no noticeable lag. While the Moto E 4G performed slightly better during our benchmarks, the Smart Prime 6 has a bigger screen, better camera and is £30 cheaper, making it our choice out of the two handsets. Read our Vodafone Smart Prime 6 review. 5. Xiaomi Redmi 3S Rating: Reviewed on: 11 August 16 RRP: £100 Buy from Xiaomi Tech Compare: all Xiaomi Redmi 3S deals Right now the Redmi 3S Pro is available for just an extra £5 over the 3S, but ordinarily we would have said you will struggle to find better value for money than what is offered by Xiaomi's new Redmi 3S. This budget Android phone is feature-packed and capable, and has a new fingerprint scanner. You can't expect any more for £120, just remember that Google Play isn't installed out of the box. Read our Xiaomi Redmi 3S review. 6. Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 Rating: Reviewed on: 19 July 16 RRP: £135 Compare: all Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 deals Vodafone’s Smart Ultra 7 in our opinion isn’t really an upgrade over the Smart Ultra 6. It’s £10 more expensive than the previous model and doesn’t really perform as well – the Smart 7 had worse benchmarking results than its predecessor in GFXBench, scoring 13fps compared to 14fps in T-Rex and 5.3fps compared to 5.7fps in Manhattan, although the Smart Ultra 7 bested the 6 in Geekbench 3 with results of 3002 compared to 2469. The camera, though the same on paper, seems to have had a slight downgrade too, producing rather washed out photos during testing. On the other hand, the 5.5in 1080p HD display is vibrant and crisp, and one must remember that the smartphone only costs £135 so if you are on a budget, it’s still a solid option. Read our Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 review. 7. Motorola Moto E 4G Rating: Reviewed on: 3 March 15 RRP: £109 inc. VAT Compare: all Motorola Moto E 4G deals The new Moto E 4G is a worthy upgrade over the original Moto E, with upgrades in every area. For an extra £20 it adds 4G LTE connectivity and a front-facing camera, plus performance and storage improvements. It might not be as fast as the grey-market Doogee F1 Turbo Mini, but this Moto E 4G is a much better deal than the EE Kestrel, making it the best budget 4G phone intended for UK sale we've seen. Read our Motorola Moto E 4G review. 8. Cubot P12 Rating: Reviewed on: 21 January 16 RRP: £74.99 inc. VAT Compare: all Cubot P12 deals We can't argue with the immense value for money offered by the Cubot P12. It's not the fastest budget phone we've seen, but it is probably the best-looking. The lack of 4G support is disappointing, but the spec sheet otherwise offers fairly impressive reading at this price. A strong rival to the Vodafone Smart Prime 6 as a network-unlocked budget smartphone, even if Vodafone as a brand is much better-known in the UK than is Cubot. Read our Cubot P12 review. 9. Wileyfox Swift Rating: Reviewed on: 26 November 15 RRP: £129 inc VAT Compare: all Wileyfox Swift deals For a brand-new smartphone maker's first effort, we're impressed with the Wileyfox Swift. It's a stylish little handset which offers essentially the same specs as the Moto G for less money. We love the customisation available in Cyanogen OS but elements such as the cameras aren't as good as rivals. Vodafone's Smart Ultra 6 remains a better option for slightly less money - unless a 5.5in screen is too big in which case look at the Smart Prime 6 as an alternative. Read our Wileyfox Swift review. 10. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 31 May 16 RRP: £121 plus import duty from China (16GB storage, 2GB RAM) Compare: all Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 deals The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 may not be best suited to UK users out of the box, but with some simple setup tweaks it is an excellent budget Android phone with a fantastic design and performance for the price.  Read our Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 review. 11. Xiaomi Redmi 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 2 February 16 RRP: £114.95 Compare: all Xiaomi Redmi 3 deals The Xiaomi Redmi 3 is a very decent budget Android phone, but it isn't intended for a UK audience and doesn't come with Google Play installed out of the box, so we wouldn't recommend it for those not familiar with Android. It has a plasticky but decent build, with good performance for the money.  Read our Xiaomi Redmi 3 review. 12. Bluboo X9 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 January 16 RRP: £82.02 Buy from Bluboo Compare: all Bluboo X9 deals We never fail to be impressed by how much value you can get for your money if you're prepared to buy a smartphone from China rather than the UK. Bluboo might not be well known over here, but its X9 is a stylish phone that packs in both a fingerprint scanner and a 5in full-HD screen for just £110. General performance is capable, and there's plenty of space here for all your apps and media.  Read our Bluboo X9 review. 13. Meizu M3 Note Rating: Reviewed on: 19 June 16 RRP: £132.58 Buy from Meizu Compare: all Meizu M3 Note deals The Meizu M3 Note is a great phone, with outstanding battery life and a nice metal unibody design, but it isn’t a patch on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, which is faster and comes with a better camera, more up-to-date software and, importantly, a cheaper price tag. That said, it’s difficult for us to recommend to UK users (particularly novice UK users) the Meizu M3 Note over other budget Chinese smartphones we’ve tested, given that Google Play is not preinstalled and so much of it has not been adapted from Chinese. Read our Meizu M3 Note review. 14. EE Harrier Mini Rating: Reviewed on: 7 July 15 RRP: £99 inc. VAT Compare: all EE Harrier Mini deals We're much keener on the Harrier Mini than we are its bigger brother. While both phones offer very good value, £99 sounds much more appealing than £199, and we prefer the Mini's more compact design. Performance is slower and the screen isn't as good, but you won't get top-end specs from either phone. But as much as we think the Harrier Mini is a great deal, the Vodafone Smart Prime 6 offers better value. It's £20 cheaper and has a larger, better screen, and it seems more adept in photography. Buy the Harrier Mini over the Smart Prime 6 only if you'll benefit from Wi-Fi Calling once it becomes available.  Read our EE Harrier Mini review. 15. Motorola Moto G 2014 (second generation) Rating: Reviewed on: 15 September 14 RRP: £145 inc VAT Compare: all Motorola Moto G 2014 (second generation) deals With a bigger screen, much better speakers and improved cameras, the new Moto G is a great budget smartphone. The lack of support for 4G will be a deal-breaker for some, though. It isn't without its rivals, but if you're specifically looking for a budget dual-SIM Android phone, it's a good choice. Read our Motorola Moto G 2014 (second generation) review. 16. Just5 Blaster 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 November 15 RRP: 149 Euro + 12 Euro shipping (approx £105 + £8.50 shipping) Compare: all Just5 Blaster 2 deals Although you can't just walk into a shop and buy it in the UK, this Just5 Blaster 2 is certainly a better budget buy than the Samsung Galaxy Core Prime. At around £105 it's no surprise to find a plastic build, but we appreciate the inclusion in the box of interchangeable colour covers. The screen is good, if a little dull, and performance is spot-on at this price point. The cameras are acceptable, and the software free of bloat. A good all-round budget option.  Read our Just5 Blaster 2 review. 17. Samsung Galaxy Core Prime Rating: Reviewed on: 21 October 15 RRP: £109 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy Core Prime deals If you love Samsung Android phones then you'll like the Galaxy Core Prime. It does lack a few features, but the missing ambient light sensor is one cut corner too far. For only £79, we prefer Vodafone's Smart Prime 6. It has a 5in 1280x720 screen, better cameras and an ambient light sensor. Plus it runs an essentially plain version of Android. Read our Samsung Galaxy Core Prime review. 18. EE Rook Rating: Reviewed on: 22 July 15 RRP: £49.99 Buy from Everything Everywhere Compare: all EE Rook deals If you don't mind the basic design, the EE Rook isn't a bad little phone at all. We can hardly argue with the price of £39 for existing customers and the performance is better than we expected for a sub-£50 phone. It's mainly the miserable viewing angles of the screen which put us off so you are better off spending a little more if you can afford it. Read our EE Rook review. 19. Moto G 4G Rating: Reviewed on: 13 August 14 RRP: £135 inc VAT Compare: all Moto G 4G deals Motorola's Moto G is the best budget smartphone around. At £135 it's got great build quality, an excellent screen, decent cameras and Android 4.3 Jelly Bean soon to be upgrade to 4.4 KitKat. Read our Moto G 4G review. 20. Motorola Moto G 4G 2015 Rating: Reviewed on: 9 April 15 RRP: £149 inc. VAT Compare: all Motorola Moto G 4G 2015 deals If you're looking for a cheap 4G smartphone then the Moto E 4G is the best deal on the market right now. If you would rather have a cheap dual-SIM phone with 3G connectivity then the mark 3 Moto G is your best bet. But the new Moto G 4G for 2015 is not the best phone for either customer, and its larger, higher-resolution screen, marginally improved photography credentials and stereo sound are not enough for us to turn a blind eye to its £60 higher price, slower hardware and missing software features.

Android phone buying advice and best Android phone reviews.  Also see: Best Phone Deals We have removed the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from our smartphone chart due to the ongoing battery issues which, in some cases, are catching on fire. It has been discontinued so if you have one, stop using it and return it for a refund. Android has the largest market share in the smartphone world, but whereas Apple’s share is divided between just a few iPhones with obvious differences between them there are hundreds of Android phones available to buy. And the choice gets even more confusing when you consider that each Android phone manufacturer has multiple Android phone product lines, each with its own features and benefits. Also see: Best smartphones 2017 UK In our best Android phones chart we focus primarily on flagship devices, with the exception of where a phone lower down the range stands out for its excellent value (see the OnePlus X and Moto G4), feature set or performance. The phones in this group are those most likely to be bought on a contract, however, and their initial cost will be largely irrelevant. If you are buying them SIM-free you should check out our best SIM-only deals, but if budget is a primary consideration for you, also see our round-up of the best budget phones.  Specs to look for in an Android phone When we talk about flagship smartphones, we really just mean the top model in a company’s phone line-up. You’d usually expect to pay between £500- and £600 for it SIM-free, or around £40- to £50 a month on a contract. But cheaper phones can have flagship specs - and especially when you consider some of the surprisingly affordable Chinese phones we review.  In 2017 a flagship Android phone specification will look something like this:  • Android 6.0 Marshmallow (Android Nougat will increasingly be available on new Android phones soon) • Slim, lightweight metal frame Content continues below • 5-5.5in Quad-HD IPS display with Gorilla Glass 4 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 820/821 quad-core processor or comparable octa-core chip • 4GB+ of RAM • 32GB of storage, plus microSD support • Fingerprint scanner • 12Mp-plus primary camera with dual-tone flash, optical image stabilisation, laser autofocus and large apertures, plus support for 4K video recording • 5Mp selfie camera • 4G LTE Cat.9 • Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi • Bluetooth 4.2 • NFC, GPS, GLONASS, OTG • Circa-3000mAh battery with fast charging We’ve placed the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge at the top of our list because it is the fastest Android phone in our benchmarks, with the longest battery life, the best camera quality, and it has a load of extra features such as the dual-curved-edge screen, heart-rate scanner and new always-on display (also seen in the standard Galaxy S7 and LG G5). We love its premium metal-and-glass, waterproof build, and although there isn’t a huge amount new in this year’s model Samsung really didn’t need to make any huge improvements to retain its crown for best Android phone. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017. But that’s not to say the other phones in our list are not worth a second look, and especially now that we get closer to the point where it’s impossible for phone makers to differentiate their devices on traditional grounds such as performance (all are excellent). The LG G5, for example, has a cool new modular design that lets you bolt-on accessories to expand its functionality, and it’s one of few flagship phones to feature a removable battery. The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 has a large screen with stylus support for enhanced productivity, while the HTC 10 supports Hi-Res audio, and the Sony Xperia Z5 ties into PS4 Remote Play. For the ultimate in screen quality, the Premium variant of the Xperia Z5 has a crazy-high-resolution 4K screen. The Xiaomi Mi 5s is significantly cheaper than the competition here, but offers many of the same features. This is the International Edition, which ships with Google Play support and, as such, most users will quickly find themselves in its MIUI 8.0 UI. For a pure Android experience there can be no better than Google’s own Nexus 6P, Pixel and Pixel XL, and as Google devices they will always be first to receive new operating system updates.  (Also see: What's the fastest smartphone 2017 for comparison with more Android phones.) Of course, with all the best Android phones on a similar level of awesomeness, your choice may come down purely to how it looks - and that’s something we can’t help you with, other than to point out the build quality information not visible from the PR shots and offer our own opinion on how they look.

Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £639 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 edge deals The Galaxy S7 edge is no longer the semi-gimmick it was before. Although some of the main features are things from the Galaxy S5 – Micro-SD and waterproofing – Samsung has given fans what they want. It's now a refined, sophisticated and highly desirable piece of technology. The battery isn't removable but the phone lasts longer than before and has seriously powerful specs under the hood. It has almost everything you could want from a phone even though the IR blaster is gone. We're also very impressed with the new camera and unless the screen is too big for you (despite some software features to help out) we think it's worth getting the S7 edge for the extra £70 with its gorgeous looks and extra functionality. Right now, this is the best smartphone money can buy. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review. 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £569 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 deals The Samsung Galaxy S6 was the best phone of 2015 and, although it’s still early days, the Galaxy S7 is a serious contender for best phone of 2016. Samsung has taken into account what its fans want, addressing the three main areas of concern: removable storage, waterproofing and battery life. It’s also upgraded the core hardware and photography gear, added an always-on display and some useful software. Right now the Galaxy S7 is simply unbeatable. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 review. 3. LG G5 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 May 16 RRP: £529 inc VAT Compare: all LG G5 deals The LG G5 is one of the most radical phones to come along in a while and we’re glad the firm has shaken things up with the modular design. The G5 is innovative and interesting with unique features but it’s a shame the design and build feels unfinished in areas. It’s a top-notch device which can hold its own with the best phones in performance and cameras, but it’s LG’s modular design which is the real selling point here. There is bags of potential but the future of this is unclear so it’s hard to be definite right now. The G5 is one of the best phones around but for completely different reasons to the Galaxy S7. Read our LG G5 review. 4. OnePlus 3T Rating: Reviewed on: 4 January 17 RRP: From £399 Buy from OnePlus Compare: all OnePlus 3T deals The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected. Read our OnePlus 3T review. 5. Xiaomi Mi5s Rating: Reviewed on: 29 November 16 RRP: £282.75 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Mi5s deals We cannot recommend the Xiaomi Mi5s enough. This is the smartphone every 2016 flagship wanted to be, and it comes with a price tag half that of theirs. Fantastic build quality, fantastic performance, fantastic storage, battery and connectivity options - the Xiaomi Mi5s gets a big thumbs-up from us. Read our Xiaomi Mi5s review. 6. Google Pixel Rating: Reviewed on: 9 December 16 RRP: £599 inc VAT Compare: all Google Pixel deals The Pixel has plenty going for it: it’s small, well built, speedy and has excellent cameras. It also supports Google’s Daydream VR headset and runs the plain version of Android 7 – complete with Google Assistant - and will get timely updates. But it isn’t waterproof, doesn’t have a microSD slot or stereo speakers and we’d have preferred a quad-HD screen for VR use at this price. If those downsides don’t bother you, and the OnePlus 3T is too large, then the Pixel is a fine choice and a great Android phone. Read our Google Pixel review. 7. Google Nexus 6P Rating: Reviewed on: 28 April 16 RRP: From £449 inc VAT Compare: all Google Nexus 6P deals Originally, Nexus phones stood out for being excellent value at a price that was low, but not the lowest. They weren't an alternative to flagship phones, but they had the advantage of running stock Android and getting the next version more quickly. The 6P, though, is not only a flagship, but is arguably the best Android phone to buy at the moment. It won't suit everyone due to its size, nor those looking for a phone with dual-SIM slots or a removable battery. There's no support for wireless charging either. But the excellent screen, front-firing speakers, quick charging, great cameras, speedy performance and Android Marshmallow add up to make this a phone that's a pleasure to use. And yes, it's also cheaper than its rivals, so unless you think it's worth shelling out extra on the Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+ or iPhone 6S Plus, the Nexus 6P is the one to buy. Read our Google Nexus 6P review. 8. HTC 10 Rating: Reviewed on: 9 May 16 RRP: £569 inc. VAT Compare: all HTC 10 deals There's a lot to like with the new HTC 10 including a number of hardware upgrades across screen, camera and audio, plus a Nexus-like stock Android experience. However, we're not totally sold on the design and it's tough at the top these days. While the HTC 10 is a solidly good phone and a respectible upgrade for M9 owners, it doesn't blow the competition out of the water. The features which appeal the most are more niche than mass market. Read our HTC 10 review. 9. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £472.99 Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Mi Note 2 deals The Mi Note 2 was wrongly overshadowed at its launch. This is a gorgeous big-screen Android phone with very decent performance, a great camera and plenty of storage. We'd like to see a Quad-HD screen on Xiaomi's flagship phone, but this one should prove plenty sharp and clear. Google apps are not preinstalled, but there is a workaround if you are happy to do some tweaking. Read our Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review. 10. Huawei P9 Rating: Reviewed on: 27 April 16 RRP: £449 Compare: all Huawei P9 deals When comparing the P9 to other flagships, it’s important to remember the £449 price which makes it considerably cheaper than many of its rivals (but not the identically priced Nexus 6P that's also made by Huawei). Overall, we're impressed with the phone: it's well built, feels good and looks good. The cameras aren't the absolute best out there, it doesn't top the charts in game tests and the screen isn't Quad HD, but these minor quibbles are outweighed not only by the price but also because, unlike the Nexus, the P9 lets you stick in a microSD card to expand the storage. If you can afford it, the Galaxy S7 is a better phone overall, but this is a great choice if you can't. Read our Huawei P9 review. 11. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Rating: Reviewed on: 15 October 15 RRP: £484.99 Buy from Samsung Compare: all Samsung Galaxy Note 5 deals So, what do we think of the Galaxy Note 5? We’re very fond of just about every aspect of the Galaxy Note 5, from its curved and sleek design to its vibrant display and high-resolution camera. It can handle almost anything you can throw at it thanks to its CPU, GPU and 4GB of RAM and we experienced no lag during our testing. The only bad point is that the Note 5 would sometimes falsely detect the S Pen detaching – and to point out such a minor fault says a lot about the quality of the handset. With this being said, we’re both surprised and sad that the Galaxy Note 5 won’t be heading to UK shores any time soon. Read our Samsung Galaxy Note 5 review. 12. Honor 8 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 September 16 RRP: £369.99 inc VAT Compare: all Honor 8 deals The Honor 8 is a fantastic smartphone, but the price has gone up from the Honor 7. In return for the additional expense you get a fantastic dual-camera, a sleek and stylish design, a faster fingerprint sensor and a beautiful display, which combined make the Honor 8 a worthy competitor to the OnePlus 3. Read our Honor 8 review. 13. Sony Xperia XZ Rating: Reviewed on: 31 October 16 RRP: £539 inc VAT Compare: all Sony Xperia XZ deals The Xperia XZ is an attractive phone in design if you can get on with the angular style and while it's cheaper than rivals such as the iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, you can get better value with some older phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7. While the hardware is decent, we can't help but mention the very similar Xperia Z5 will save you a lot of money. Read our Sony Xperia XZ review. 14. Google Pixel XL Rating: Reviewed on: 24 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB) £819 (128GB) Compare: all Google Pixel XL deals While the Pixel XL is an attractive phone (if you can get used to the glass section) with decent combination of hardware and software, we can't help but feel a bit disappointed. It's very similar to the much cheaper Nexus 6P and OnePlus 3. You can get plenty of other Android phones for less which have extra features like waterproofing and expandable storage. Sorry Google, but things have gone a bit wrong here. Read our Google Pixel XL review. 15. Moto Z Play Rating: Reviewed on: 11 November 16 RRP: £379.99 inc VAT Compare: all Moto Z Play deals The Moto Mods accessories are the main reason to buy the Moto Z Play, but it's a decent mid-range phone regardless. For an affordable price Lenovo offers premium design, good specs and a well-rounded software experience. You only really need to splash out on the Moto Z for the Quad HD screen, Snapdragon 820 and OIS camera should you feel the need for those features (but also bear in mind the more expensive version has no headphone jack and a smaller battery). Read our Moto Z Play review. 16. Sony Xperia Z5 Rating: Reviewed on: 29 April 16 RRP: £549 inc VAT Compare: all Sony Xperia Z5 deals There's no doubt that the Xperia Z5 is a solid flagship smartphone from Sony and an improvement on the Z3+. We certainly like the new frosted glass rear cover and the addition of a fingerprint scanner in that slim power button. The camera isn't great compared to the best phone cameras out there though, and you can get a better phone for similar money. The price has dropped, and it's now a decent-value waterproof flagship with a Micro-SD card slot. However, you can't use it underwater, and there are newer rivals which are better value, take better photos and have better performance. Read our Sony Xperia Z5 review. 17. Motorola Moto G4 (2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 18 November 16 RRP: £169 Compare: all Motorola Moto G4 (2016) deals Although the new Moto G4 is more expensive than the third-generation, Motorola is offering a Full HD screen, better processor, more storage and memory. Not everyone will enjoy the jump to 5.5in or the lack of full waterproofing but this is still a brilliant phone for under £200. Just bear in mind that the 3rd-gen Moto G is now a great buy at £149 and the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 offers similar specs for just £125 (albeit SIM-locked). Read our Motorola Moto G4 (2016) review. 18. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Rating: Reviewed on: 22 October 15 RRP: £429 inc VAT Compare: all Sony Xperia Z5 Compact deals The Xperia Z5 Compact is the best small phone around, but then there's not much competition in this area anymore and there are a number of phones offering decent specs for a lot less. Those looking for Z5 design and specs in a smaller frame will be pleased but it's a shame about the chunky design with the sharp edges. The fingerprint scanner is a great addition and the Snapdragon 810 with almost stock Android provides slick performance. However, the camera isn't as good as Sony makes it out to be. Read our Sony Xperia Z5 Compact review. 19. Google Nexus 5X Rating: Reviewed on: 12 April 16 RRP: £299 inc VAT Compare: all Google Nexus 5X deals Those looking to upgrade from a Nexus 5 will be happy and sad in almost equal measure. The 5X is a fantastic phone overall, with excellent cameras, a good turn of speed and an excellent screen. But it's noticeably bigger than its predecessor despite the small increase in screen size, it has limited storage compared to the Nexus 6P and it lacks a couple of camera features due to the slower processor. The absence of wireless charging is another blow for some, but additions such as the fingerprint scanner will make it a great upgrade for others. Read our Google Nexus 5X review. 20. Sony Xperia X Compact Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 16 RRP: £379 Buy from Carphone Warehouse Compare: all Sony Xperia X Compact deals The Sony Xperia X Compact is an odd little smartphone. On the one hand its build quality, lack of waterproofing and lack of a standout feature make it harder to recommend compared to the older Xperia Z5 Compact. However, if you want a sub-5in Android smartphone with excellent battery life it’s the best current option out there. For all its flaws, we also kept coming back to the phone largely due to its sheer portability. Just don’t buy the blue one. Read our Sony Xperia X Compact review.

We round up the best smartphones including best Android phones and best iPhones - best phone reviews. Also see: Best new phones coming in 2017. Also see: Best Phone Deals When we review smartphones we take into account their build quality and design, ease of use, features, performance and value, although the latter isn’t always such a big deal when it comes to a phone you are most likely to buy on a contract. Generally speaking a flagship phone will cost between £500- and £600, or between £40- and £50 per month on a contract. If you are buying SIM-free then you should also check out our best SIM-only deals. Value becomes more important when you consider older-generation phones. For example, we still think the Samsung Galaxy S6 is better than many of the phones in this chart, especially when you consider that it’s now available under £400 SIM-free. However, we move all older-generation smartphones to our best mid-range phones chart, and you’ll now find the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge sitting at the top of this best phones chart. We also have a best budget phones round-up if you're looking to minimise costs. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017 Note that we have removed the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from our chart due to Samsung's discontinuation of it following battery problems. Best phone 2017: Android vs iOS vs Windows There are multiple mobile phone operating systems, but really only two worth talking about: Android and iOS. Windows phones account for around 1 percent of all phones sold, so it makes more sense to go with Android or an iPhone. If you do have your heart set on Windows, also see our list of the best Windows phones 2017. (Similarly, for purely Android choices see Best Android phones.) The vast majority of phones available run the Android operating system, with Marshmallow the latest version. While Apple’s iOS platform has a much lower market share, developers always release their apps on iOS so it has one of the best app stores you'll find. For more, see Android vs iPhone. Also, for a more in-depth look at each OS see our Android Marshmallow review, iOS 10 review and Windows 10 Mobile review. If you have an Android phone or and iPhone and want to move to the other type of phone, it's fair easy move your contacts and other data from one to the other. See How to move from Android to iPhone and How to move from iPhone to Android. What you can't move is paid-for apps, so keep this in mind if you're considering a change of platform. Content continues below Best phone 2017: Why you should buy an unlocked phone An unlocked phone is one which is not tied to any particular mobile operator, such as Vodafone or EE. Buying unlocked usually means buying the phone outright without a SIM. The most important point is that an unlocked phone is almost always a better deal than buying a phone on contract. The only real exception to this are Apple's iPhones - because of their traditional popularity, operators do often subsidise the cost of buying an iPhone in order to lock you into a lucrative long-term deal. Generally speaking, however, if you can afford the upfront cost of the handset, you will pay less over the life of your phone by buying unlocked.  More importantly, you are not locked in. If you want a new handset at any time, you can buy one without having to up-purchase your way out of a contract, or commit to another two years.  SIM-free vs unlocked One thing to be sure of when purchasing an unlocked or 'SIM-free' phone is that not all SIM-free handsets are unlocked. The excellent Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is a classic example of this. It is SIM-free, but if you want to use it for any network other than Vodafone you have to first use it for a month with a Voda SIM, and then pay £20 to get it unlocked. EE's own branded phones are similar. In both cases it may well still be better to buy network branded phones and go through the pain of getting them unlocked, than to buy on contract. But you should do your research before you take the plunge. We can help with that with our feature: 'How to unlock any phone'. The right SIM One other thing to consider is the size and shape of the SIM required for your phone. Make sure you get a nano-SIM if a nano-SIM is what your phone requires. If you get that wrong it is easily solvable - every network will gladly send over a different-sized SIM. SIM cards tend to come in all three sizes - you simply pop out the one you need. But that's assuming you are getting a new SIM, and if you're looking for a SIM-free phone or unlocked phone you probably already have one. You can buy adaptors that let you fit a Nano-SIM or Micro-SIM in a Micro-SIM or full-size SIM slot for a very small charge. More important is to make sure that if you want 4G you get a 4G-enabled phone and SIM.

Samsung Galaxy S7 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £569 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 deals The Samsung Galaxy S6 was the best phone of 2015 and, although it’s still early days, the Galaxy S7 is a serious contender for best phone of 2016. Samsung has taken into account what its fans want, addressing the three main areas of concern: removable storage, waterproofing and battery life. It’s also upgraded the core hardware and photography gear, added an always-on display and some useful software. Right now the Galaxy S7 is simply unbeatable. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 review. 3. LG G5 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 May 16 RRP: £529 inc VAT Compare: all LG G5 deals The LG G5 is one of the most radical phones to come along in a while and we’re glad the firm has shaken things up with the modular design. The G5 is innovative and interesting with unique features but it’s a shame the design and build feels unfinished in areas. It’s a top-notch device which can hold its own with the best phones in performance and cameras, but it’s LG’s modular design which is the real selling point here. There is bags of potential but the future of this is unclear so it’s hard to be definite right now. The G5 is one of the best phones around but for completely different reasons to the Galaxy S7. Read our LG G5 review. 4. Apple iPhone 7 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 October 16 RRP: £599 (32GB), £699 (128GB), £799 (256GB)  The iPhone 7 is an evolution of the 6S, so if you were expecting a revolution you’ll probably be slightly disappointed. However, aside from the underwhelming battery life, it is an excellent phone. It’s waterproof, has fantastic cameras and performance, and the new stereo speakers sound great. There’s now 32GB of storage as a minimum, which helps to mitigate the higher prices. If you have an iPhone 6s, it’s hard to justify upgrading (even for some people with a 6) but if you’re out of contract and want a small phone, it’s the best Apple has made yet. Read our Apple iPhone 7 review. 5. OnePlus 3T Rating: Reviewed on: 4 January 17 RRP: From £399 Buy from OnePlus The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected. Read our OnePlus 3T review. 6. Xiaomi Mi5s Rating: Reviewed on: 29 November 16 RRP: £282.75 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest We cannot recommend the Xiaomi Mi5s enough. This is the smartphone every 2016 flagship wanted to be, and it comes with a price tag half that of theirs. Fantastic build quality, fantastic performance, fantastic storage, battery and connectivity options - the Xiaomi Mi5s gets a big thumbs-up from us. Read our Xiaomi Mi5s review. 7. Google Pixel Rating: Reviewed on: 9 December 16 RRP: £599 inc VAT The Pixel has plenty going for it: it’s small, well built, speedy and has excellent cameras. It also supports Google’s Daydream VR headset and runs the plain version of Android 7 – complete with Google Assistant - and will get timely updates. But it isn’t waterproof, doesn’t have a microSD slot or stereo speakers and we’d have preferred a quad-HD screen for VR use at this price. If those downsides don’t bother you, and the OnePlus 3T is too large, then the Pixel is a fine choice and a great Android phone. Read our Google Pixel review. 8. Apple iPhone 7 Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 19 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB); £819 (128GB); £919 (256GB)   The iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent phone. It’s Apple’s best yet, but it is also Apple’s most expensive yet, with a huge starting price. In some respects, the upgrades seem to justify this, but at the same time some features are arguably only catching up with what the competition has been offering for a while now – water-resistance for one. Taken as a whole, the performance, battery life, camera quality and stereo speakers are all compelling reasons to upgrade. But our advice remains much the same as for the iPhone 7: if you already own the previous generation, there’s not enough here to justify ditching a 6S Plus, especially if you’re halfway through a two-year contract. Those just coming out of contract on the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus would do well to grab a 7 Plus.   Read our Apple iPhone 7 Plus review. 9. Google Nexus 6P Rating: Reviewed on: 28 April 16 RRP: From £449 inc VAT Originally, Nexus phones stood out for being excellent value at a price that was low, but not the lowest. They weren't an alternative to flagship phones, but they had the advantage of running stock Android and getting the next version more quickly. The 6P, though, is not only a flagship, but is arguably the best Android phone to buy at the moment. It won't suit everyone due to its size, nor those looking for a phone with dual-SIM slots or a removable battery. There's no support for wireless charging either. But the excellent screen, front-firing speakers, quick charging, great cameras, speedy performance and Android Marshmallow add up to make this a phone that's a pleasure to use. And yes, it's also cheaper than its rivals, so unless you think it's worth shelling out extra on the Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+ or iPhone 6S Plus, the Nexus 6P is the one to buy. Read our Google Nexus 6P review. 10. HTC 10 Rating: Reviewed on: 9 May 16 RRP: £569 inc. VAT There's a lot to like with the new HTC 10 including a number of hardware upgrades across screen, camera and audio, plus a Nexus-like stock Android experience. However, we're not totally sold on the design and it's tough at the top these days. While the HTC 10 is a solidly good phone and a respectible upgrade for M9 owners, it doesn't blow the competition out of the water. The features which appeal the most are more niche than mass market. Read our HTC 10 review. 11. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £472.99 Buy from GearBest The Mi Note 2 was wrongly overshadowed at its launch. This is a gorgeous big-screen Android phone with very decent performance, a great camera and plenty of storage. We'd like to see a Quad-HD screen on Xiaomi's flagship phone, but this one should prove plenty sharp and clear. Google apps are not preinstalled, but there is a workaround if you are happy to do some tweaking. Read our Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review. 12. Huawei P9 Rating: Reviewed on: 27 April 16 RRP: £449 When comparing the P9 to other flagships, it’s important to remember the £449 price which makes it considerably cheaper than many of its rivals (but not the identically priced Nexus 6P that's also made by Huawei). Overall, we're impressed with the phone: it's well built, feels good and looks good. The cameras aren't the absolute best out there, it doesn't top the charts in game tests and the screen isn't Quad HD, but these minor quibbles are outweighed not only by the price but also because, unlike the Nexus, the P9 lets you stick in a microSD card to expand the storage. If you can afford it, the Galaxy S7 is a better phone overall, but this is a great choice if you can't. Read our Huawei P9 review. 13. iPhone 6s Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 9 September 16 RRP: From £619 inc VAT The iPhone 6S Plus is a remarkable phone, and it's still a fantastic phone 12 months on. The 16GB model has finally been banished and the new minimum storage of 32GB should be workable for a lot of people. 3D Touch can sound gimmicky, but it’s absolutely not. It requires effort to force yourself to use it to begin with, but it quickly becomes second nature and app developers have put it to use in apps and games. Read our iPhone 6s Plus review. 14. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Rating: Reviewed on: 15 October 15 RRP: £484.99 Buy from Samsung So, what do we think of the Galaxy Note 5? We’re very fond of just about every aspect of the Galaxy Note 5, from its curved and sleek design to its vibrant display and high-resolution camera. It can handle almost anything you can throw at it thanks to its CPU, GPU and 4GB of RAM and we experienced no lag during our testing. The only bad point is that the Note 5 would sometimes falsely detect the S Pen detaching – and to point out such a minor fault says a lot about the quality of the handset. With this being said, we’re both surprised and sad that the Galaxy Note 5 won’t be heading to UK shores any time soon. Read our Samsung Galaxy Note 5 review. 15. iPhone 6S Rating: Reviewed on: 9 September 16 RRP: From £539 We're really impressed by the iPhone 6s. It's fast, has a great screen and a good main camera. It misses out on some of the 6s Plus's features, including optical stabilisation, but most people won't really notice. In short, the iPhone 6s is a great phone, and it's even better now it's cheaper and the base model has 32GB of storage. Read our iPhone 6S review. 16. Honor 8 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 September 16 RRP: £369.99 inc VAT The Honor 8 is a fantastic smartphone, but the price has gone up from the Honor 7. In return for the additional expense you get a fantastic dual-camera, a sleek and stylish design, a faster fingerprint sensor and a beautiful display, which combined make the Honor 8 a worthy competitor to the OnePlus 3. Read our Honor 8 review. 17. Google Pixel XL Rating: Reviewed on: 24 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB) £819 (128GB) While the Pixel XL is an attractive phone (if you can get used to the glass section) with decent combination of hardware and software, we can't help but feel a bit disappointed. It's very similar to the much cheaper Nexus 6P and OnePlus 3. You can get plenty of other Android phones for less which have extra features like waterproofing and expandable storage. Sorry Google, but things have gone a bit wrong here. Read our Google Pixel XL review. 18. Sony Xperia XZ Rating: Reviewed on: 31 October 16 RRP: £539 inc VAT The Xperia XZ is an attractive phone in design if you can get on with the angular style and while it's cheaper than rivals such as the iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, you can get better value with some older phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7. While the hardware is decent, we can't help but mention the very similar Xperia Z5 will save you a lot of money. Read our Sony Xperia XZ review. 19. iPhone SE Rating: Reviewed on: 11 April 16 RRP: £379 inc VAT (16GB); £429 inc VAT (64GB) Buy from Apple The SE is what many iPhone fans have been asking for, and it's a great upgrade if you're still using an iPhone 5. For 5S owners, things aren't quite as clear cut. If you're not happy with the 5S's performance, the SE should solve that problem. However, unless you really want to shoot 4K videos, you're not going to notice a massive improvement in photo quality. There's a much bigger jump in quality if you're coming from an iPhone 5 (or earlier), however. Make sure 16GB is enough before you order: we'd recommend the 64GB version for most people. Read our iPhone SE review. 20. Motorola Moto G4 (2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 18 November 16 RRP: £169 Although the new Moto G4 is more expensive than the third-generation, Motorola is offering a Full HD screen, better processor, more storage and memory. Not everyone will enjoy the jump to 5.5in or the lack of full waterproofing but this is still a brilliant phone for under £200. Just bear in mind that the 3rd-gen Moto G is now a great buy at £149 and the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 offers similar specs for just £125 (albeit SIM-locked). Read our Motorola Moto G4 (2016) review.

Beware that the Pixel conceals a secret: artificial intelligence (AI). While Google advertised a lot of ground-breaking features, it also stuffed in a few unadvertised secrets. So what lurks inside of the Pixel? In short, you get pocket-AI, cloud storage, and more. But let’s start with what Google advertised in its first promotional video: According to Google’s marketing department, the Pixel comes with the world’s best smartphone camera, a 3.5″ audio jack, and the mysterious Google Assistant. Artificial Intelligence Comes to Smartphones AI drives the Pixel’s uniqueness. Before 2016, AI and smartphones remained separate from one another. But thanks to Google’s acquisition of three AI firms and Motorola’s ATAP division, the road seems paved toward pocket AI. With the Pixel, civilization hurtles toward a future in which AI fits in your pocket. And that learning machine listens to everything you do. Modern AI, such as that found in the Pixel, relies on a technology known as known as machine learning 4 Machine Learning Algorithms That Shape Your Life 4 Machine Learning Algorithms That Shape Your Life You may not realize it but machine learning is already all around you, and it can exert a surprising degree of influence over your life. Don't believe me? You might be surprised. Read More . Google’s machine learning techniques relate to their acquisition of the AI research firm, DeepMind. DeepMind developed AlphaGo — the AI that beat Go champion Lee Sedol Google's AI Breakthrough: What It Means & How It Affects You Google's AI Breakthrough: What It Means & How It Affects You Read More . And that means a technology capable of outsmarting a human may now inhabit your pocket. But how has Google adapted AI to fit inside of the Pixel? Google Assistant The Pixel’s upgraded personal assistant, Google Assistant, is smart. Like AlphaGo, it learns from observing human behavior. Based on how you use the Pixel, the assistant recommends actions. For example, using telemetry data, it calculates when you leave for work, forecasting traffic and suggesting alternate routes. Other times, Assistant peeks at your photo roll and suggests stitching together bursts of pictures, creating a stabilized image. Sometimes it even automatically applies stylish filters to photos. Here’s an example of an automatically applied filter: Check out this automatically-created animated GIF: Assistant’s self-learning abilities include (at least) five categories. If enabled, Assistant displays related notifications (Google refers to these as Cards) whenever it senses that the user needs them. These kinds of cards include: Weather — Detects your region and forecasts weather for the day. Work Commute — Detects driving conditions, alternative routes, and determines an estimated time of arrival. Next Meeting — Assistant can also hook into your calendar and sense upcoming meetings. Reminders — If you ever set a reminder using Assistant, Google creates a virtual card, which displays itself at a specified time or place. News — Based on your particular news interests, such as sports or technology, Assistant pulls up relevant cards whenever it detects you need them. Ignore the marketing. Assistant will come to all Google products. The reasons range from the practical to the frightening. For the most part, Google wants Assistant to offer conversational capabilities. And training a neural net requires tremendous amounts of raw data and user telemetry. It Knows What You’re Talking About Another Google Assistant feature worth mentioning: contextual processing. Older personal assistants work great for asking a single question. But they’re terrible for continuing a dialog. Assistant closes the gap between a conversant AI and one-shot assistants by adding context to issues. For example, if I ask Assistant for directions to the supermarket and then correct myself by saying “I meant to the nearest bank,” Assistant places that question within the context of the conversation. It then intuits that the user wants to issue a navigation correction. The process feels seamless and without the stutter of the previous generation of personal assistants. To date, only a few Google products include Assistant. That’s the Pixel, Allo, and Google Home. A few other apps, such as the Photo app, include Assistant as a feature. However, it’s unclear as to the extent of its integration. Free Cloud Storage and Smart Storage Google furnishes the Pixel with free and unlimited cloud storage for photo backups. Combined with Smart Storage, you can take an unlimited number of photographs without running out of space. It works like this: based on how you’ve configured your Pixel, your phone might delete images every 30, 60, or 90 days — but only if your photos have been backed up. Plugging your phone into a power source triggers the backup process. Configuring Smart Storage To configure Smart Storage, navigate to Settings and the choose Storage. In the Storage menu, you can toggle both the backup frequency and whether or not a backup occurs. Unfortunately, Google does not integrate (nor does it permit integration) with a third-party cloud storage solution like OneDrive. Because Smart Storage links into Google Photos, that means you get unlimited photo backups Get Free Unlimited Photo Storage & More with Google Photos Get Free Unlimited Photo Storage & More with Google Photos If you aren't using these hidden Google Photos features, you're really missing out. (Hint: There's free and unlimited photo storage!) Read More . Unlike other smartphones, the Pixel comes with full resolution quality. The unlimited storage that comes with other services usually means the photos are compressed (what’s compression? How Does File Compression Work? How Does File Compression Work? File compression is at the core of how the modern web works, one could argue, because it allows us to share files that would otherwise take too long to transfer. But how does it work? Read More ) and of diminished quality. Facial Recognition One of the creepiest features in Google Pixel is its photo app. Once you snap a picture of friends, Google uploads your photos to the cloud, and its AI applies a facial recognition algorithm Face Recognition: How It Works and Who's Watching? Face Recognition: How It Works and Who's Watching? How much is your face worth? Read More . Each and every person in your album can receive a tag (or name). You can search your database for all pictures of a specified individual. But that also means Google keeps a catalog of not just your identity, but the identities of your friends (and random strangers who blundered into a shot). The potential consequences remain unknown — but the risk of abuse chills even the staunchest of technology advocates. Concierge Service If getting access to a machine assistant wasn’t enough, Google also borrowed a feature from the Amazon Fire Phone: direct access to a human assistant. If your Pixel ever malfunctions — or you just need some advice — a human operator can help with just the touch of a button. Hidden Pixel Features In addition to AI, the Pixel throws in a few hidden features, which the users needs to enable or discover. These include gesture support, a red screen-tinting feature, and a hidden notification red-green-blue (RGB) LED light. Night Mode (AKA Night Light) The Lighting Research Center’s study on light exposure found that red light reduces insomnia Get a Good Night's Sleep by Filtering Your Phone's Blue Light Get a Good Night's Sleep by Filtering Your Phone's Blue Light Your phone's screen is keeping you awake. Don't let it. These apps will help you rest well. Read More . Fortunately, Android 7.0 added the ability to automatically redden display color at night. Unfortunately, Google chose to remove this feature in Android 7.1.1 — except for Pixel users. It’s silly that Google pulls useful features from Android, but it helps differentiate their product from their (now) competitors. Keep in mind that Night Mode requires activation. Turning it on is a simple process. First, go to Settings and select Display. Then go to Night Light and turn it on. You can also configure the hours in which the display tints amber. However, the default settings should match your body’s natural circadian rhythms. The Hidden RGB LED Light Among its unadvertised features, the Pixel throws in a secret LED for notifications. Users can enable this feature, which saves on both battery life and screen lifespan. To permit it, the user must navigate to Settings > Notifications and click on the gear icon in the upper-right side of the screen. Then enable the Pulse notification light. From then on, whenever users receive a notification, the LED blinks. I haven’t figured out any of the reasons why the light flashes different colors. It seems that redder light indicates important notifications. Gesture or Motion Activated Features Google co-opted motion and gesture controls from Motorola — they refer to it as Move. The gesture controls allow the user to launch certain apps or features by physically moving the phone. Move includes, as of 2016, five different actions: fingerprint scanner gestures, jump-to-camera, twist-for-selfie, lift-to-check-phone, and double-tap to wake. Fingerprint Scanner Notifications Control Another feature most users won’t know about hides inside of the fingerprint scanner: the scanner doubles as a notifications toggle. Sliding one’s finger down over the scanner displays the notifications tray. A single swipe up dismisses the tray. Here’s a video of how to enable the feature: Jump-to-Camera LG’s flagship smartphones can launch its camera by double-clicking on its power button. The Pixel borrows this feature. This can help you quickly get to your camera app so that you never miss a shot. Twist-for-Selfie Like the Moto X, the Pixel can switch between cameras with ease. It works like this: after opening the Camera app, make a double-twist motion while holding the Pixel to launch the selfie camera. The Pixel then switches from the rear-facing camera to the front-facing camera. Lift-to-Check-Phone and Double-Tap to Wake Ambient Display turns the screen on temporarily to show notifications. On an AMOLED panel, this saves battery life and helps with screen burn-in Save Your Screen: How to Prevent Burn-in on AMOLED Screens Save Your Screen: How to Prevent Burn-in on AMOLED Screens Does your device's screen suffer from burn-in? Do you just want to keep your screen healthy for a long time? Then you'll want to read this article. Read More . Newer Android devices usually include Ambient Display by default. However, the Pixel adds two additional features. Lift-to-check-phone allows the Pixel to switch its screen on whenever it senses that someone has picked the phone up. Double-tap to wake spares the physical power button by waking the device by double-tapping on the screen. Here’s a video demonstrating the new features: Google Daydream View Another interesting feature is its virtual reality (VR) platform: Daydream View. It’s a mostly-cloth headset with a remote that allows you to get lost in a virtual world using the Daydream View app. Here’s a breakdown and explanation of the Daydream View in action: “Improved” Aesthetic Design To distinguish between conventional Android devices and a Pixel, Google added some distinct visual flourishes. Wallpaper Picker The Pixel’s AI-driven software can choose wallpaper designs for its user, along with custom system sounds. Here’s a video demonstrating the wallpaper picker in action: Color Theming Early leaks indicated that the Pixel was finally adding a dark theme. Unfortunately, these rumors turned out to be bunk. What we got was ridiculously underwhelming. Google turned the System User Interface blue, instead of cyan. Here’s a comparison between what you get in stock Android and what you get in a Pixel: Unfortunately, blue AMOLED subpixels degenerate at a faster rate than other colors. I don’t know why Google decided to use blue icons for the settings menu. Even so, the differences are minimal at best. Why Did Google Put Special Features in the Pixel? No one knows for sure. It seems that Google wants to move to where the real money lies: flagship smartphones. And no company makes more money per smartphone than Apple. Unfortunately, Apple’s model revolves around proprietary standards. Unlike Apple, Google doesn’t sell 19 dongles Apple Is Forced to Make USB-C Dongles Cheaper Apple Is Forced to Make USB-C Dongles Cheaper Apple has cut the price of its USB-C adapters. Because it turns out people still use USB-A and HDMI, and don't want to pay top dollar to use their own peripherals. Read More . However, it has moved its Night Light technology out of Android’s open source ecosystem. Given this baby-step away from open standards, should you trust Google by putting its learning machine in your pocket? Have you discovered any hidden features in the Pixel? If not, what exclusive features have you hooked? Please let us know in the comments! Image Credit: Oleg1969 via Shutterstock.com | Cryteria via Wikimedia Commons Previous PostNo US Phone Number?

One could wake lock-screen to see the time and notifications without touching the phone. Reply Kannon Yamada January 14, 2017 at 1:06 pm According to what I've read, there are differences in the way the Pixel implements these features. Assistant is supposed to be a fairly different experience on the Pixel. On a Nexus, the service is supposed to still be known as Google Now. Even so, I doubt Google will keep much a divide between GN and GA. They need to collect data from both user pools in order to improve the capabilities of their Assistant service. Reply ale elatey January 10, 2017 at 6:40 am Not well known that the Pixel supports split screen. Tap and hold the square application button to choose the split application. The application button becomes split too. Tap and hold again to return to one application Reply Kannon Yamada January 15, 2017 at 7:05 pm Thanks for the suggestion Ale! Reply Justin Brightbill January 9, 2017 at 10:42 pm Google pixel must have known I wasn't using its full potential because it pointed me to this article. Spooky. Reply Kannon Y January 10, 2017 at 12:06 am :-) If I had to guess, I'd say it's just Google routing traffic toward articles talking about the Pixel. Reply Justin Brightbill January 9, 2017 at 10:42 pm Google Assistant must have known I wasn't using its full potential because it pointed me to this article. Spooky. Reply JP January 9, 2017 at 8:50 pm Just got the google pixel because my previous phone a samsung s7 got stolen. Main motivation was because I read a write up and was told in the shop that the pixel could be recharged to 7 hours usage in 15 minutes and had a long battery life. That turns out to be completely untrue and the battery life is on the good side of average. As a phone the samsung s7 with sd card and waterproofing is a way better phone. The AI thing is completely pointless and the google assist which is useful for hands free dialling doesnt really work. I think if you need AI to run your life something is wrong. However as the main purpose as a phone it makes the best calls which is a big plus as you can actually hear the other person speaking. Reply Kannon Y January 10, 2017 at 12:05 am Wow, they really oversold the battery endurance of this thing. It's among the best phones out there for battery life, but that's contingent on a lot of factors that aren't comparable in reviews. For example, a lot of times the carrier itself makes a difference in battery life. For example, if you have Verizon and are near a tower, the battery life is going to appear to be great. But if you have T-Mobile and a weak signal, the battery life is going to be atrocious. In theory, the new antenna in the Pixel will lead to better battery life, all factors the same. But the metal unibody is going to have a potentially deleterious impact on reception, which could translate into worse signal strength. Regarding the AI, it is constantly learning from you. The more you use it, the better it understands your unique voice. Also, you have to enable many of the AI features (instructions in this article). You may need to enable "always on" in the Google app to get the full benefit of its assistant (and spying) capabilities. Reply ashley rothery January 10, 2017 at 1:17 pm Let your phone die then charge it after 15min turn it on and you'll be around 60/70% think that's how they got away with saying it... ? It is a good battery though never really die unless I hammer it though. Reply Shannon January 11, 2017 at 4:55 am Yes I was told by a Google operator that the 60% is roughly 7 hours of battery life. However to get to 100% it needs to charge a good hour and a half. My phone, as long as I keep the screen brightness down, lasts around 24 hours with out a re-charge and I use it for 4 jobs, listening to music, using IG all day long, etc. I love my pixel! Reply Chris Olsen January 9, 2017 at 6:43 pm On the drop down notification menu tap and hold the gear icon for about 10 seconds. When released a prompt will ask if you want to to turn on "system UI tuner".

Reply Doc January 9, 2017 at 4:39 pm It's too bad that some of the "hidden features" don't include a removable battery, and an SD card slot with "adoptable storage." Reply Kannon Yamada January 9, 2017 at 5:38 pm :-) What sucks is LG brought the removable battery back and their phones sold terribly. And it was a GREAT phone. They're now headed toward their first loss ever (something like 30 million in operating losses). It's really sad. Reply likefunbutnot January 9, 2017 at 8:58 pm I don't think the battery and SD card are going away on the G6, even if they ditch the camera lens and headphone amp. It's really the major feature of the LG flagships at the moment, though I will 100% agree that they're the only currently acceptable brand of smartphone at the moment because of it. (And also the "can be completely disassembled with just a screwdriver, which is another awesome hidden feature on LG products.) In any case, I think that it's somewhat irresponsible for Google to ship exclusive features on its devices. That just encourages OEMs to develop alternatives and further fragment Android. That's just not what Android needs as an ecosystem. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google app now allows notifications for Doodles By Ida Torres - January 9, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google Doodles are more than just fun things that the search giant adds to their homepage. It also reminds us of important events and milestones that we otherwise may not remember (or even know). But sometimes, you miss out on these amazing doodles and games so Google has rolled out a minor server-side update to allow you to turn on notifications for these on your smartphone’s Google app. This is probably just one of the many notification options you will eventually have the option to turn on. Previously, when you go to the settings of your Google mobile app, there is no section for notifications. But Google has quietly added this and it’s even at the top of the settings page, ahead of Search and Home screen customization options. For now though, the only option you have on the Notifications settings is to toggle on and off for “New Doodle games, videos, and interactive experiences”. This is a good way to bring people’s attention to those interesting things that Google chooses to highlight every once in a while. The notifications for your feed cards, or what you formerly know as Google Now, is not in the new main notifications section but is still in the Your Feed section under the search settings. It may just be that they haven’t transferred it yet to the new section, but it may cause confusion for some new users of the Google app. You don’t have to update anything manually, but just wait for the server-side update to come to your Google app, as long as you carry the most recent version of the app and it is also not limited to the current beta version.

MUST WATCH Four charged for Facebook Live beating video 02:18 Story highlights Krasodomski-Jones: Videos like The Facebook Live torture have existed on the dark corners of the web for years As sites like Facebook and Google grow, the likelihood of these going mainstream was inevitable Alex Krasodomski-Jones is a researcher for the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at the think tank Demos in London. His primary research interest is political extremism and its reportage on social media. The opinions in this article belong to the author. (CNN)Last week, two men and two women were arrested and now face hate crime and kidnapping charges for the abduction and torture of a man in Chicago. The city is notorious for its violent crime. The difference this time was that the crime was broadcast live to thousands of viewers around the world through Facebook. For at least half an hour, Brittany Covington filmed as her sister and friends bound and tortured the man, streaming the assault through Facebook's much-advertised Live app. Unsurprisingly, the video went viral. Many questioned why it reportedly took so long for Facebook to remove the video, others questioned the police response, while others were simply shocked and upset. As a video that is horrifying and brutal, however, it's merely the latest outrage in a well-established digital tradition. JUST WATCHED Gruesome attack broadcast on Facebook Live Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Gruesome attack broadcast on Facebook Live 01:24 Violence and death have been a staple of the Internet for decades. Websites such as Rotten, Ogrish and Bestgore emerged in the 90s and 00s, archiving footage of traffic accidents, autopsies and execution videos. The mantle has most recently been passed to LiveLeak, a British website started by the same team as Ogrish, which hosts graphic videos of rapes, murders and deaths. As of July 2016, Alexa ranks it as one of the top thousand websites in the world, with millions of visitors a day and multimillion dollar revenues. Read More Despite LiveLeak's popularity, it is fair to say that this kind of content has usually lurked in the shadowy corners of the web. There's an argument to say that this is still largely the case. The great Internet companies -- Google and Facebook -- have pursued a relentless campaign of sanitizing the experience of surfing the web. For many of their hundreds of millions of users, these companies' sites make up a near totality of their web experience, and holding the mainstream means keeping it clean. This is no mean feat, especially when the vast majority of the effort going into moderating the billions of messages that flow through their platforms is manual. Relying on users to report a piece of content is the norm, supplemented by an army of outsourced administrators. The bleak reality of this -- surely one of the worst jobs on the Internet -- is brought to life in this Wired article. As the number of Internet users has swelled from million to billions, the number of websites they are likely to spend their time on has probably decreased. JUST WATCHED Ethical questions over Facebook Live Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ethical questions over Facebook Live 03:48 The 90s and 00s saw an explosion in the number and variety of sites, but the last 10 years has seen a consolidation by Facebook, Google and Microsoft of the time we spend online. Add to this a change in user expectation and you have a recipe for disaster: where once it was perfectly acceptable to post a reply on a forum and wait for an administrator to approve it, this would be utterly unthinkable to most people in 2017. The impact on Facebook's share price, not to mention the free and open debate the site enshrines, of pre-moderation -- "hold on, we're just checking the photo you've tried to post is OK" -- would be absolutely catastrophic. Facebook Live is the latest example of this drive toward breaking down the barriers and filters between you and an audience. Live video, streaming with a click, is beamed to an audience of millions without any hope of the content being checked before it hits the eyeballs responsible for Facebook's billions of pounds of revenue. The challenges of fighting against filters are well known. In the wake of the murder of a television anchor in America live on air, both Facebook and Twitter came under fire for automatically playing the video. The same was said after the recent murder of the Russian ambassador to Turkey, shot live on television; his last moments shared time and again by Twitter and Facebook users, as it is every time a video emerges of the barbaric crimes of ISIS. Anyone connected with someone sharing these videos could have been scrolling through their timelines or news feeds and suddenly been force-fed a snuff video -- hardly fulfilling these companies' promises of a family-friendly, mainstream and safe web experience. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook It isn't just snuff or gore, either. Islamist extremists and the far right also operate on major social media platforms. As web users are increasingly concentrated on a small handful of sites, we click shoulder-to-shoulder with the kinds of people sharing the kinds of content we didn't expect nor want in our lives. There's a contradiction here. On the one hand, governments and commentators are calling for social media companies to take greater responsibility for the content on their sites. On the other, these companies are embracing technological change that makes publication quicker, audiences bigger and administration more difficult. If this pattern continues, we can expect further outrages along the lines of the Chicago video, and less patience from governments already keen to pass the buck on Internet governance. Major social media platforms have nothing to gain from hosting this content, of course, but the truth is they are building beasts that they cannot tame.

During the opening keynote, the CEO of the recently spun-out Alphabet company touted how the new in-house sensors will provide a competitive advantage against self-driving efforts by companies that just purchase off-the-shelf cameras and radar components. In a narrative that parallels how the Pixel has numerous advantages not found on other Android phones by being Google-built, Waymo’s approach allows for deeper integration between hardware and software, as well as their respective teams. In addition to reducing development time, there is a notable accuracy improvements in resolution and sensing capability because of the structure. It has also significantly cut down the cost of the key LiDAR sensor responsible for making a 3D view of the world from $75,000 in 2009 to $7,500 this year. Complementing the current mid-range mapping, the company has also developed new-short range LiDAR that detects close-up objects and a long-range one that detects small faraway objects. Ultimately, such a drastic 90% drop in component cost will help with the public adoption of self-driving vehicles. With 100 produced as part of the latest test fleet, the electric Pacifica will be deployed in both Google’s native Mountain View and Phoenix, Arizona. Krafcik shared that Google’s various self-driving cars will have collectively driven three million miles on public roads by May.

Only the big online advertising networks can cut off the lifeblood and reduce the financial incentive to create phony stories. iStock By Knight Kiplinger, Editor in Chief From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, February 2017 Q. I’m troubled by the proliferation of fake news on the internet. I read that the fabricators of these stories have made millions in ad revenue from Google, Facebook and other online advertising networks, based on the traffic the bogus stories generate. What’s being done to stop this? SEE ALSO: Knight Kiplinger's Money & Ethics Quiz A. Fortunately, a lot is being done—belatedly. Ad revenue is the lifeblood of internet publishing, and fake-news mills—employing writers who dream up and churn out outrageous fiction—have been set up simply to tap into a multibillion-dollar ad market. Their made-up stories (with “click bait” headlines) go viral on social media, shared by thousands of web readers who believe them to be true. This traffic triggers ad placements from automated “programmatic advertising” engines used by Google, Facebook and in­dependent online advertising networks. These companies enable the fake-news boom and generate millions in revenues for themselves. Only they can cut off the lifeblood and reduce the financial incentive to create phony stories. Google says it does not place its marketing clients’ ads on sites that allow violent content, hate speech or pornography, and now it says it will include fake-news sites in its ad ban and also try to keep bogus stories out of its news feeds. Facebook also announced recently it will not place ads on fake-news sites, but gullible Facebook users will still be free to share bogus stories with their friends. SEE ALSO: 10 Things You Must Know About Social Security Meanwhile, large national advertisers—always concerned about projecting a positive image for their brands—are putting pressure on social media companies and online media-buying networks to guarantee that their ads don’t appear on fake-news websites or next to bogus stories. Accomplishing this will require a combination of computerized and human monitoring to identify the fraudulent sites, and it won’t be easy. And remember: Curtailing the ad dollars won’t stop fake news that is created not primarily for financial gain, but for ideological purposes—to inflame partisan passions and influence public opinion.

Google’s Tango platform uses computer vision to make mobile devices location-aware, relative to their surroundings — without relying on external systems, such as GPS, Wi-Fi, or sensors. This is useful for indoor navigation and 3D mapping and opens up a world of opportunities for commercial use cases. Just last week, BMW announced it was using Tango to help sell cars remotely. There aren’t many devices on the market that support Google Tango, however. Google’s Lenovo Phab 2 Pro and the Asus ZenFone A do, but the latter was just announced at CES last week and won’t be available until later this year. For this latest initiative, the DIA has teamed up with GuidiGo, a publishing platform specifically for creating guided tours on mobile devices — and a company that has embraced Tango in the past. In February of last year, GuidiGo demoed one of the first Project Tango apps capable of 3D indoor geolocation, at the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya in Barcelona. In terms of how the Detroit Institute of Arts will harness the AR powers of Tango, well, visitors will be able to borrow a Lenovo Phab 2 Pro from the front desk, and then they can explore exhibits such as ancient Egyptian mummies, using an AR overlay to garner an X-ray view of the inside of the sarcophagi. Above: Mummies Above: Ishtar Gate: Ancient Babylonia Elsewhere at the DIA, various pit stops will serve up puzzles, games, and quizzes that patrons can interact with through their Lenovo phablet. Google says it’s working with other museums globally on similar AR-infused exhibits, but it hasn’t shared any specifics yet.

Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Car Wars Is Google’s Self-Driving-Car Business Back from the Dead? Waymo represents a step forward for Alphabet after a series of setbacks. But can the “self driving technology company” compete? by Maya KosoffJanuary 9, 2017 8:36 am Email Facebook Twitter By Bill Pugliano/Getty Images. Google hasn’t given up on the arms race in Silicon Valley to develop self-driving cars, but its years-long progress has been slow and frustrating. Although the $570 billion tech giant had previously been testing a series of retrofitted Lexus S.U.V.s near its headquarters, and has inked a partnership deal with Fiat Chrysler, it has also faced setbacks like losing the head of its self-driving car project. Despite beginning to develop autonomous vehicles in 2009—long before Uber, Lyft, or other competitors—Google appeared to have fallen behind its Silicon Valley rivals. But rumors that Google’s car program was dying may have been exaggerated. In December, one day after the Information published a report claiming that Google was shelving its self-driving-car ambitions in order to pursue partnerships with existing automakers, Google parent company Alphabet spun out its self-driving-car branch as Waymo, a “self driving technology company.” Waymo may not be manufacturing self-driving cars, chief executive John Krafcik, told a crowd of reporters at a press event in December, but it is certainly in the self-driving-car business. “We’ve been really clear that we’re not a car company although there’s been some confusion on that point. We’re not in the business of making better cars. We’re in the business of making better drivers.” Now, Waymo’s cars are about to hit the road. It may not be the “Google Car” that the company originally envisioned, but a fleet of 100 Chrysler Pacifica vehicles, retrofitted with Waymo sensors, are expected to make their debut later this month. The minivans, developed in partnership with Fiat Chrysler, will hit the streets of Phoenix and Google’s hometown of Mountain View by the end of January, Waymo announced at the North American International Auto Show on Sunday. The new Waymo fleet also represents a dramatic improvement in terms of cost and technology. Unlike previous iterations of Google self-driving vehicles, Waymo says its cars have technology made entirely in-house, bringing the price of its sensors down from the $75,000 Google paid in 2009 to just $7,500, The Verge reports. Waymo also claims its autonomous vehicles in 2016 had a lower rate of “disengagements,”—the term for when a person sitting in the car had to intervene to take control of the car to prevent an accident—than in 2015. All told, it seems to be a spot of good news, or at least a moment of good optics, for Waymo and for Google. But Google still has work to do, especially compared to its competitors. Tesla’s electric vehicles, with their semi-autonomous technology, have been on the road for years. Uber, a company founded the same year Google began to develop its self-driving initiatives, has already been testing its own fleet of self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh, California, and now Arizona. General Motors and Lyft are said to be testing self-driving technology together. Even Apple—a company whose own highly secretive self-driving-car project has faced major setbacks—last month acknowledged plans to develop self-driving technologies. Aside from being far behind its competition, Waymo also has yet to prove and explain its business plan: Bloomberg reports that eventually its cars may be used for a ride-sharing program to rival Uber’s, but one that would start at an extreme disadvantage in scale.

Mark Zuckerberg: Trump’s favorite golden boy in Silicon Valley, Peter Thiel, is both an early Facebook investor and serves on Facebook’s board, which bodes well for the company’s ties to the president-elect. But Trump could also change immigration laws in a way that affects Facebook’s ability to hire highly skilled employees. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg and others in the tech community signed onto a brief submitted to the Supreme Court in favor of Obama’s executive actions, arguing that more immigration benefits the tech industry and the country. Trump appears to disagree.Photo: From Bloomberg/Getty Images. Marc Lore (Jet.com): E-commerce companies like Jet.com could become victims of a Chinese trade war. Trump has threatened to add tariffs of 45 percent of Chinese exports. “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what they're doing,” he told supporters earlier in 2016. Trump’s proposed solution could make foreign-made goods—which comprises the bulk of e-commerce products—vastly more expensive.Photo: From Rex/Shutterstock.

Elon Musk: Though Musk and Trump ally Peter Thiel are close—they helped co-found PayPal together, and made their respective first millions of dollars off of it—two of Musk’s companies may be in a precarious situation under a Trump administration. Shareholders in both SolarCity and Tesla Motors now must consider what Trump could do to federal clean-energy tax credits and subsidies, which both companies currently receive.

Where does it go from here? In the future, what surrounds the iPhone will be more important than the phone itself.

You're 10 years old! What do you want to be when you grow up? When Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 10 years ago today, he touted Apple's ability to combine three products -- "a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls, and a breakthrough internet communications device with desktop-class email, web browsing, searching and maps -- into one small and lightweight handheld device." Those characteristics are still in today's iPhones, but they're so much more. Think over 2 million apps more, changing everything from the way we commute to the way we communicate with family and friends. At the same time, it has spawned hundreds of copycats and created new industries that couldn't exist without phones. The iPhone is the most successful consumer device ever created. So where does it go from here? The iPhone: 2007, meet 2017 It was different, it was bold. How is it now? Ten years later, we dug up the original iPhone to give it another spin. by Scott Stein 2:24 Close Drag For Apple, the next 10 years will be about refining and simplifying its hugely popular phone. Whether the iPhone remains a rectangular slab of glass for the next decade is anyone's guess (or, rather, up to chief designer Jony Ive). Importantly, what will become an even bigger focus will be everything else that surrounds the iPhone, like virtual reality and smart home. "iPhone is an essential part of our customers' lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement posted in Apple's online newsroom. "iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come." Here are some of CNET's predictions: Simplicity iPhones used to celebrate just doing a few things well. Now, iOS and the iPhone are endlessly complex. Settings and hidden Easter eggs lurk everywhere. Managing cloud storage and photos, or navigating notifications and privacy will send you down rabbit holes. 18 The iPhone and the gadgets it laid to rest Apple could aim for simplicity once again, paring down the experience to something more essential. It might find a way of pushing only a few things to your attention while keeping the rest in the background. It needs to reinvent its design, even the software, to be less cluttered. And then there are all the phones. There used to be one iPhone... now there are models in different sizes, colors and processors. One rumor has Apple offering multiple display types next year. The reality of the phone market is Apple will have to continue to meet different budgets and lifestyles. There's no going back to that single original iPhone. Connecting to everything The iPhone's already a hub for our fitness trackers, the Apple Watch and a growing world of smart home appliances and connected gadgets. The latest version of iOS included smart home shortcuts built into the Control Panel, like a home-based remote control. Imagine more of that spreading across more devices and services. Seeing the original iPhone for the first time Travel back to January 9, 2007, just after Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone onstage at Macworld and CNET's Declan McCullagh got a first glimpse of it under glass. 2:04 Close Drag It'll be able to talk to other gadgets more easily. Bluetooth 5 promises greater range and higher speeds to connect to other peripherals. In a home, that could make a huge difference. A wild card could be Wi-Gig, an extremely high-bandwidth, short-range variation of Wi-Fi that could be a path to how future iPhones could mirror instantly to larger screens or accessories. Deeper AI Amazon Echo opened the door. Talking to your gadget is now awesome, not annoying. Siri, however -- which lives on nearly all Apple devices -- is still problematic. It's not as responsive as Amazon's Alexa or as intuitive as Google Assistant. It should do more and understand context better. See also 10 ways the iPhone changed everything CNET's take on the iPhone 7 Plus Does the Mac still matter? A more ambient, helpful iPhone is a necessary next step. Consider Assistant and how it lives on Google's Pixel phone, ready to help. iOS 9 takes a few steps there, but expect Apple to continue knitting together apps and services with AI and machine learning. The interesting twist is the company's emphasis on doing its computations on-device, instead of in the cloud. That's a completely different approach than Google and Amazon, one rooted in privacy. Apple's latest Photos app smartly organizes photo libraries by faces and places and automatically knits together memory-reel trailers around themes. Better Siri and smarter AI aren't just what the iPhone needs; it's what Apple needs across the board. Totally port-free We're all sad about losing the headphone jack. What about losing the rest? MacBooks and iPhones have shaved down their inputs to just a few options in 2016. Next, perhaps, comes Lightning. The original iPhone (left) compared to the current iPhone, the 7 Plus.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Charging, for iPhones, still happens via the Lightning cable. Contactless charging -- the type that has been available for Android phones for years, and is used by the Apple Watch, hasn't arrived yet. But when it does, perhaps in the iPhone 8, that Lightning cable will be a lot less necessary. We already can transfer files locally via AirDrop or stream via AirPlay. It would be shocking if Apple followed up a headphone jack-free iPhone 7 with a completely closed-off iPhone 8, but someday there will be an iPhone that flirts with going full wireless. All-screen The iPhone still has bezels, areas of the front of the phone where the screen doesn't extend. For instance, consider the area around the Home Button. Samsung's recent phones have gone nearly edge-to-edge, and even wrapped the display around the sides. A bezel-free all-screen iPhone would fill up more screen space in a smaller size for an easier grip. Reports of Touch ID being integrated into the display would mean you'll just touch a part of the screen to log in or pay. The cloud, the cloud Apple's relationship with cloud services feels overcomplicated. Google and Amazon offer lots of free storage and syncing options. With iCloud, paying for the right storage tier can get pricey. Relying on the cloud has become an answer for accessing files (there's an iCloud Drive folder, now) and photos. But how do photos and videos get managed properly? Despite a growing number of alternative cloud-storage options, it's hard to keep things organized properly. Our first iPhone review from 2007 Take a look at our review of the first iPhone. by Kent German 1:04 Close Drag Cloud services are what's bringing Mac OS and iOS closer together, sharing iMessage, file storage, photos, Notes and Pages files. Cloud services like those from Google co-exist, sometimes beautifully, sometimes awkwardly. Phones are, more than ever, just small terminals to a huge connected system. The iPhone's going to be increasingly dependent on the cloud. AR and VR Samsung has already turned its flagship phones into mobile virtual reality accessories via Gear VR. Google has the Daydream headset and its Cardboard initiative. Apple, however, has stayed quiet on VR. Instead of thinking about a pair of phone-goggle accessories, consider the possibilities of a more advanced camera. Google Tango -- an augmented reality initiative under the same umbrella as Daydream's VR -- uses depth-sensing 3D cameras to scan a room and help project imaginary things into it... or, track movement so that a VR headset could feel like it's really mapping motion. Cook has stated his interest in augmented reality, which probably indicates that more advanced camera features could be where things go next. Enlarge Image The original iPhone came with 4GB of storage.Photo by James Martin/CNET Much like the iPhone 7 Plus can sense depth with its dual cameras, imagine more advanced cameras that can enable augmented reality like Google Tango. Then imagine that these cameras could do power tracking for a VR headset, like the Occipital Bridge. Maybe that's way too much in the weeds for Apple, a company that seems to prefer sleek minimalism. But it's a short jump for the iPhone to adopt AR or VR. Moving past the phone itself The biggest change in the iPhone of 2027 is that it may not be a phone at at, at least not in the sense of the device we know today. What could be more vital about mobile computing over the next decade is what's around the phone. Apple already envisions the iPhone as the remote control for our lives; over the next 10 years, that remote will extend to things like VR and smart homes and cities. And much like the iPod got obliterated, the iPhone may go the same way. Phones may work like Chromecasts, where devices pick up and stream based on what another tells it. Or the Apple Watch can serve as the key to tying connected devices together. Apple is already exploring cross-device communication; if your phone rings, so does your Mac or iPad. "There's at least one vision of the future where the phone as a discrete device goes away and turns into other interfaces like wearables," Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said. Input, output and the brains of a product will be "less tied to a specific device over the years."

The termination of the API comes in the wake of Hangouts' transition to becoming a business-centric platform with basic and straightforward features. Last Wednesday, Apple silently published a blog post about Google+ Hangouts API support. In the post, the Mountain View giant revealed that henceforth the service’s API is no longer supported and that existing apps will continue to function until April 25, 2017. Not only that, developers who were working on new apps received the sad news that they could no longer launch their apps for Hangouts. The Register pointed out that Google’s announcement did not come into light until this Monday because it isn’t really common for people to follow FAQ posts. The tech site also noted that there aren’t that many people who would be affected by the end of the Hangouts API. Related Stories Google's VR Push Builds Momentum With Huawei View Headset Announcement Google Calendar iOS App Update Comes With Apple Health Integration Google CEO Calls For $30 Entry-Level Smartphones Explaining why it terminated Hangouts API, Google stated that this is part of its plan to push Hangouts to providing a new experience focused on meetings to users. The tech giant revealed that Hangouts would soon be focusing on enterprise, so it is best for it to get rid of apps or features that were targeted for social scenarios. Though Hangouts API support has been dismissed, there are some apps that will still be supported by Hangouts. DialPad and RingCentral apps for dialing and placing calls, Slack and other enterprise communications tools, as well as broadcasting tools Toolbox, Cameraman, Control Room will continue to function despite the April 25 expiration date. SlashGear reports Hangouts users will not have access to stickers, doodles and AR overlays from now on. The formerly all-in-one text and video chat service is streamlining for the business-minded users, while Google pushes Allo and Duo to users who want a more social text-based and video-based chatting service, respectively.

Starting with the Detroit Institute of Arts (before moving on to other, as-yet-unnamed institutions), Google is offering visitors Tango-enabled devices that can be used to explore exhibits in augmented reality. At the DIA, visitors can request a Lenovo Phab 2 Pro (the first Tango-enabled smartphone) from the front desk, and use it to find out more about various artifacts. The handset can peer inside sarcophagi to reveal mummified bodies, visualize lost architecture like the six-story Babylonian Ishtar Gate, and restore ancient limestone reliefs to their original, bright coloring. As well as visualizations, the app (made by GuidiGo, which previously designed AR museum guides for Google Glass) will also offer quizzes and games. Tango can be used to discover the long-faded paint applied to Limestone reliefs. Or visualize missing architecture — like the Ishtar Gate. It’s a use-case that certainly plays to Tango’s strengths. The platform offers a more immersive take on the AR-through-a-phone-screen experience we’ve become familiar with thanks to apps like Pokémon Go. Advanced sensors not usually seen in a phone are used to map depth and scale, which allows digital overlays to be applied more accurately to 3D surfaces. The results can be engaging (perfect for museums), but the overall experience is still hit-and-miss. In our review of the Phab 2’s AR abilities we thought it was “at least one step beyond a gimmick,” but not much more than that. It doesn’t help that only two consumer handsets support Tango at this point: the Phab 2 Pro, and the Asus ZenFone AR, announced at CES last week. As with this latest museum initiative (which, again, only includes a single institution at this point), it seems Google needs to dedicate more resources to Tango if it truly wants its take on AR to take off.

At Bett 2017, it's looking to spread the word about its cloud-first approach to education and what it can bring to schools and colleges. The company launched in 2011, after a three-year research project with the Independent Schools Association focused on IT services within independent schools. At the time, small independents were looking for new approaches to support teaching and learning, but needed something extremely cost-effective, that required little or no on-site equipment and that could operate with minimal on-site support. Founder and Managing Director, Ian Nairn, led a team that looked at a range of different learning platforms, including products from Microsoft and Google before deciding, in Nairn's words, "that the set of services that most closely fitted the needs and aspirations of those schools was Google Apps for Education". However, while schools were interested in exploring the potential of Google's cloud-based services, they still expressed a need for help in deployment, training and support. In response, Nairn and his team formed C-Learning as a cloud learning solutions and services business focused on the delivery of apps, training to make the most of them and - ultimately - the devices used to access them. When Chromebooks debuted in the UK in 2011, C-Learning became one of the first Google partners to sell them. "We made a couple of decisions early on," says Nairn, "and one was that we would just deal with schools and colleges; we're a pure education business." C-Learning has resisted the temptation to move into other markets, like business or local government, because "we decided to go very deep, in terms of our expertise, and remain very focused. We're very much a networked partner business. We're very good at what we do. We don't do lots of things - we don't do the provision of internet or the provision of Wi-Fi or provide print - but in all the things we don't do, there's room for other partners to work alongside us. Whereas the things we do, we get people coming along to us and saying 'you've got great experience in this area, can you help us with this?''' For Nairn, it's this depth of education-specific expertise that has become C-Learning's key strength; its experience makes it easy to relate new customers and their needs to those of existing customers, and even put schools and colleges in touch with similar customers who have had the same requirements and been through the same transformations. "We've spent nearly 10 years working with schools and colleges, and we know them," says Nairn. "We know the people and we can connect one headteacher with another headteacher and say 'don't talk to me, don't talk to Google, just go and talk to a fellow headteacher, because you'll believe what they say.'" This approach has also won C-Learning business through referrals and a strong reputation, which sees its Bett presence buzzing with interest every year. Showcasing cloud-first This year, C-Learning isn't focusing on products as much as on the whole philosophy of the cloud-first mindset. In terms of cloud take-up, Nairn feels that the UK and Europe lag behind the US, where 67% of schools fully or partially consume IT services through the cloud - a figure that's expected to rise to 74% in the next two years. Nairn wants to see more schools and colleges reducing their dependence on on-premise technology and focusing on the cloud instead. "Normal market tipping points are between 15 and 20% - the point at which everyone knows someone who's made the move. From the point of view of schools and colleges in the UK going down the cloud route, we're not far away from that." "We have a story to tell, which says that if you're a headteacher in a school or college, then you need to be thinking cloud-first," says Nairn. Why? First, he feels it's important that young people get to grips with cloud-based services, arguing that they "need to be ready with a set of skills around collaboration and communication, about team-working, problem-solving and critical thinking... you can't have a situation where they go through school or college not using these tools." Second, he believes that the cloud is where the real innovation is happening, giving schools in challenging areas opportunity to improve their numeracy and literacy levels and outstanding schools the chance to drive attainment further. "There are now great resources and evidence on how to use Chromebooks, G Suite and products like Read&Write from Texthelp - cloud-based products that in 12 months can take your students, especially boys, from below the national average to above the national average," he explains. That's partly why C-Learning is so keen to reach out to headteachers and the senior leadership team at this year's Bett. "They cannot delegate the decision-making on IT to network managers and ICT co-ordinators," Nairn says. "It's too important for the school or college." In this respect, C-Learning hopes to provide more schools and colleges with a trusted source of advice on how to move cloud-wards. And what's important about Bett to C-Learning? "It's to do with the relationships we have with our partners," Nairn explains. "We want to make sure we're supporting them at Bett because they support us throughout the entire year... With HP specifically, it's all about the cloud and Chrome, VR and immersive education, like the HP Sprout." "These companies are important," he believes, "because they have the reach and research to invest in these technologies ahead of the curve. For a company like C-Learning, as a cloud-learning architect and solutions provider, it's vital that we look down the track towards 2018, 2019 and beyond, because otherwise why should schools and colleges come to us to help them plan for their future?"

By Jason Murdock January 9, 2017 12:38 GMT Russian regulator claims LinkedIn failed to comply with domestic data retention policyCarl Court/Getty Images US technology giants Google and Apple have been hit with demands from the Russian government to remove LinkedIn from app stores in Russia. The Microsoft-owned social network, aimed at business professionals, was banned in the country last year over alleged data violations. Apple confirmed it was tasked with removing the LinkedIn application last December, while Google said it would not confirm the app was removed in Russia but acknowledged it "adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates," the New York Times reported Friday (6 January 2017). Last November, the communications regulator in Russia, the Roskomnadzor, ordered internet service providers (ISPs) in the region to block access to LinkedIn after a court ruled the firm failed to adhere with a 2014 law demanding all data collected on Russian citizens be stored domestically. At the time, Roskomnadzor spokesman Vadim Ampelonsky said there had been "several cases of LinkedIn users' personal data being leaked since 2010." This was likely referencing the series of major cybersecurity incidents reported last year that impacted LinkedIn, Dropbox and others. Despite the ban, the firm's app remained accessible in Android and iOS app storefronts. Additionally, while the restrictions impacted users, it was still possible to reach the website with the use of a virtual private network (VPN). Following the further crackdown, this has now changed, swiftly impacting the firm's six million-strong userbase in the region. LinkedIn said it is "disappointed" with the regulator's decision and confirmed fresh blocks extended to the firm's smartphone application. "[The court ruling] denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses," a spokesperson said in a statement. In October last year, when speculation of the ban first emerged from Russia's state news agencies, German Klimenko, the presidential adviser for internet issues, said the block would be a "signal" for other firms – including Facebook and Twitter – which also fail to abide by the country's data law. Tensions between Russia and the US spiked following the series of cyberattacks against American political groups last year, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The US Intelligence Community (IC) claims it has obtained evidence the hackers were aligned with the Kremlin. Last week, on 6 January, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) released an unprecedented report re-affirming the position of the NSA, CIA and FBI that only "senior-most officials" in Moscow could have ordered the state-sponsored cyberattacks. "We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency," the report said. Meanwhile, on 4 January, it emerged that Apple, following demands from Chinese authorities, had removed English and Chinese-language New York Times applications from the iOS store in China on 23 December last year. Other media apps, including the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal, were left untouched, the NYT reported.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Eugene Volokh January 9 Follow @volokhc An article at Search Engine Land on Dec. 30 reported, under the title “Paradigm shift: Has Google suspended defamation removals?”: A number of attorneys who specialize in online defamation/libel cases have reported to me that Google has recently suspended its longstanding, informal policy of removing URLs from US search results that are specified in duly executed court orders. This poses a major paradigm shift for many victims of online reputation attacks. Beginning around August or September of this year, a number of attorneys from across the US began receiving blanket denials after submitting requests to remove defamatory content from Google’s search results. Since at least 2009, Google has had an informal policy of accepting many removal requests when accompanied by a properly executed court order specifying defamatory/libelous content at specific URLs. I’ve personally seen a number of cases where hundreds and even thousands of URLs have been submitted with court orders, and Google has removed those URLs from search results. But they’ve now stopped. Not for every single request, but for a sufficient number that it’s clear something has changed. Techdirt also picked this up, describing this as “Google seems to have stopped responding to defamation lawsuit court orders.” That characterization, though, appears to be something of an overstatement. Instead, my contact at Google tells me, Google is still deindexing material based on court orders, but it is looking closely at such orders to determine whether everything seems legit. One can see why Google would want to look closely, given the evidence that injunctions have been gotten against nonexistent defendants, attempts to use allegedly defamatory comments as means to deindex professional news articles, injunctions that call for the deindexing of official government documents that clearly weren’t written by the defendants, and allegations that other injunctions involve collusive lawsuits against defendants who weren’t actually responsible for the allegedly defamatory posts. At the same time, many of the orders that Google receives were indeed legitimately obtained, though it’s often hard to tell for sure which are which. (Recall that Google is generally not the target of such U.S. orders and isn’t bound to comply with them — the orders are against the alleged authors of the defamation — but Google has been voluntarily deindexing pages in response to some such orders.)

If accurate, written input could also be used to issue queries, very much like the way it’s performed on Allo.  ( Google | YouTube ) Advertisement Assistant is Google's clever, voice-activated companion, with the operative phrase being voice-activated, that is, unless for those who use Allo, which actually features a typing input aside from voice commands. The Pixel and the Pixel XL, Google's self-branded flagships, and Google's Amazon Echo rival Home, come with Assistant, but it receives commands via voice-only, presumably to champion the hands-free, no-frills nature of the smart artificial intelligence-backed assistant. That could soon change, however, as hinted by a code on the Google app's 6.10 beta. Keyboard Input For Google Assistant A dig-through of the Android search app's beta has revealed a code which suggests users could potentially refrain from barking orders to Assistant should they wish, and opt for a typing input instead, with the same informed results. Immediate benefits include not being worried over anyone within earshot hearing your personal queries, or bumbling through false voice command pick-ups, which could become fodder for hilarity. More importantly, though, the support for keyboard input could pave the way for Google to implement chat bots, which are AI-powered companions anyone can start a conversation with. The great thing about chat bots as opposed to traditional AI voice assistants are their apparent integration of personality. They seem more like friends one can talk to instead of robotic, dispirited personas. This, if partnered with a sterling AI, could spell a widespread and comfortable adoption of AI-powered virtual assistants as the upshot. As further proof of the potential features, previous teardowns of the Android Wear app brought out code snippets that alluded to the fact that Google might also port Assistant to its smartwatch OS. New code found in the Google app seems to bolster this idea. Not much can be combed apart from these, save for new settings for the Android Wear app. Could Android Wear device soon be the next home of Assistant? It's hard to say for now. Possible Google Assistant Gestures? Scouring through the code also hinted at possible gestures for the search app. References to "search gestures" pepper the beta, which could potentially suggest non-touch initialization of Google Assistant. For example, swiping down on the screen might activate the search app, among other possibilities. Android Police, responsible for the dig-through, also suggested that these alleged implementations to Google Assistant could arrive soon via a server-side or an entire app update. Bear in mind that Google might still throw the idea to the bin before ever releasing any of it. That said, the new features are logical improvements to the virtual assistant, and barring them from ever seeing the light of day could be seen an unwise choice from Google. Since its release, there's been clamor to bring over Google Assistant to non-Pixel phones running Nougat and not just Pixel, and there's no clear reason why Google is keeping it on proprietary lockdown for now. There is, however, a clever workaround to this, so users don't have to be up in arms for long. Do you have Google's self-branded flagships? Will you prefer written input over voice commands for Google Assistant? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below!

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google Assistant on Pixel phones will support keyboard input soon Software Google Assistant on Pixel phones will support keyboard input soon By Sohil Nikam - Jan 9, 2017 Google Assistant is one of the most advertized features of the Pixel smartphones, but for the reticent types, interacting with it could be a slight issue since it only accepts voice commands. That’s about to change soon, even as proof of the app preparing for keyboard input support has been spotted. Of course, this is already possible if you use Google Assistant via the Allo app. However, the native integration of the Pixel version of Assistant doesn’t allow you to do that. In the latest update to the Google app, it has been found that a keyboard icon has been included in the layout used in the Assistant popup. This is the proof which has predicted the arrival of keyboard input in the said app. Also Read: Nvidia Shield Android TV is the first to offer Google Assistant support Another upcoming feature which has been hinted at is called Search Gestures. There are no substantial details about its abilities, but Android Police has predicted it to be some sort of a new way to open the Google Search bar with a swipe down gesture rather than just tapping on it. The nature of this feature indicates that it will not just be accessible through the Pixel Launcher, but also the Google Now Launcher which is used by a large number of people. Only time will tell what the exact attribute of this feature is however. But for now, the possibility of keyboard input arriving for Google Assistant should be a far more exciting piece of news for Pixel owners.

It brings in exhibitors from all around the world and every area of technology, allowing attendees to see what's coming. As CES 2017 ended yesterday, and since Neowin was there, we thought it would be a good idea to write down some of the trends that we noticed. The smart home is coming, and Alexa owns it If there was one word that I kept hearing over and over again at different product launches at CES, it was "Alexa". Indeed, Amazon's digital assistant seems to be popping up everywhere. Lenovo announced the Smart Assistant, which is similar to an Amazon Echo, and LG showed off some robots and a smart refrigerator that uses Alexa. Huawei is another of Amazon's partners, announcing the Mate 9, which will have Alexa support later this year. And of course, there were many others. But perhaps the biggest trend - which has been running for a few years now - is to put a CPU and a Bluetooth radio in everything, and that's where the smart home comes in. While you're reading this, take a look at any inanimate object around you, and you can bet that there was a 'smart' version of it at CES. But the smart home market right now is sort of a mess. Your Philips lightbulbs aren't aware of your Nest thermostat and so on, so it can be a bit frustrating to put your smart home together. There's simply no standard to build it on. And that's sort of where Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri (HomeKit), and Google's Assistant (Home) come in. While each device probably has its own hub and its own app, you can interact with them through these voice assistants. When it came down to the smart home devices that were out there (and they seemed to be everywhere), Alexa was one of the most commonly adopted standards. HomeKit was somewhat popular as well, but I didn't hear a peep about Google Home. Indeed, for a digital assistant that grew up without a mobile platform like iOS or Android, Alexa is doing quite well, and it really stole the show at CES. 8K is around the corner While we're still complaining about the lack of 4K content, 8K is most definitely coming. Dell announced a new UltraSharp 8K Monitor, and Samsung showed off some TVs that support the resolution. Dell's monitor is powered by two DisplayPort cables, and when I tried to ask the folks at Samsung how their TVs worked, I couldn't get an answer. Luckily, the HDMI Forum announced that its 2.1 spec is coming this year, and it will support up to 10K at 120fps. So we can all look forward to soon complaining about the lack of 8K content and how most people don't even have the bandwidth to stream it, but the good news is that this means that the price of 4K will continue to drop. Will anyone actually benefit from an 8K screen? Well, I suppose that if you use a really big TV and sit absurdly close to it, yes. I saw more than a few 8K displays and TVs at the show, and Dell's monitor was the only one I could find where the company could tell me when it was coming or how much it would cost. Most of them were prototypes. VR is still big, but AR is on the horizon Remember how 2016 was going to be the year of VR? Well, it's still not something that's widely adopted, but if CES is any indication, 2017 is totally the year of VR. Microsoft showed off a number of headsets at its Partner Showcase, Intel had VR demos, and every PC OEM was announcing new gaming rigs that are VR-ready. Indeed, you certainly never had to walk very far to see someone in a head-mounted display (HMD). What was surprisingly rare at the event was augmented reality (AR). It's been almost two years since Microsoft showed off its HoloLens, and similar devices are still hard to find. But down in the South Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center, there is a small section that's dedicated to AR. I tried out one device that uses a Snapdragon 835 and runs Android. When I asked why not Windows Holographic, I was told that Android was used for the app selection. Other AR HMDs that I tried were more similar to Google Glass, and those used proprietary operating systems. One thing that seemed very clear is that the AR market is very fragmented right now, and everything seems very premature. These devices are just beginning to show up, and I wouldn't be surprised if the market really expands in the year ahead. Wearables are still strong Do you remember how smartwatches are dead? That may or may not be the case, but wearables are still very strong. In fact, I saw dozens of booths that were showing off fitness trackers alone, all of which had their own differentiators. One fitness tracker claimed to actually know when you're eating, another said it could count steps more accurately than anything else on the market, and yet another said that they're just like Fitbit, except the products sell for $15. I also noticed quite a few hybrid smartwatches. These are the ones that look like standard analog watches, but provide additional functionality, such as vibrating when you get a notification, or moving the hands to certain numbers to indicate certain things. And that's just fitness bands. There were inserts for your shoes that can track how your feet are impacted when you walk or run, clothes that can track your movements, and even wearable sex toys. It all comes down to the idea that I mentioned above, which is that these companies want to put a CPU and a Bluetooth radio in anything and everything. Moreover, these products can apply to your health, giving you a reason to buy them. Don't expect the wearable trend to die down anytime soon, because it's everywhere. PCs are still coming in new form factors In fairness, this isn't an entirely new trend, but it's definitely worth noting. Remember when Microsoft first introduced Surface and the 2-in-1 was born? Clearly, the company still isn't done redefining what it means to be a PC. At CES, HP announced its second-generation Sprout Pro, which instead of a keyboard, uses a projected second display. It even has a 3D scanner, which is as simple to use as holding an object under it and rotating it. Dell produced some innovative devices as well, such as its XPS 27, which is the company's take on Microsoft's Surface Studio. It also introduced the Canvas, which is a touchscreen display that sits flat where your keyboard would normally be. When hearing about these announcements and getting hands-on time with HP's and Dell's new devices, I really was reminded of when Surface was introduced. At the time, we had something new, and I thought that was it; Microsoft has reinvented the laptop. But with more and more new form factors coming out, one can't help but wonder what's next. Final thoughts This was the first CES that I've been to, but it was really great to be able to see all of the exciting new stuff that the big companies are working on, as well as the smaller ones. Amazon's Alexa definitely stole the show, and it really goes to show just how much work is cut out for Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Microsoft has its upcoming Home Hub, but it's already running behind. 8K devices will certainly be exciting, if only because it will normalize 4K a bit more than it already is. It has four times as many pixels as 4K does, which is about 33 million. It will raise all-new questions about bandwidth for streaming, content creation, and content availability. And then there's VR. I knew that many companies have bold virtual reality ambitions, but it's clear that this is something in which everyone seems to want to take part. Of course, AR is harder to do, so it will take longer, but it's coming down the pipeline. I wasn't surprised by the amount of wearables that I saw. I had heard the stories of CES shows gone by, where companies will make something that sounds as silly as smart underwear. I'm glad to see the market still thriving, as I do think it's important to the future of technology. Oh, but if you want one more trend, here's a freebie. There are a lot of companies that think that their generic iPhone cases are good enough for people to want to see them at a massive show like CES.

LEAD The Key to Your Company's Success Is Also Terrifying to Most Execs No manager likes to give up control. But it may be exactly what your employees need. By Marcel Schwantes Marcel Schwantes is principal and founder of Leadership From the Core, a leading provider of servant-leadership training and coaching designed to create healthy, engaged and profitable work cultures. He is an entrepreneur, executive coach, speaker, columnist and servant-leadership evangelist working on publishing his first book to be released 2017. Follow him on LinkedIn. @MarcelSchwantes Principal and founder, Leadership From the Core@MarcelSchwantes WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Imagine giving your employees a real say in how your organization is run. Think about it: They show up to work, voice their opinions, express their concerns, toss around their ideas, and...get this--management says "you're right." If that sounds like a scene from a badly scripted movie, think again. Giving employees "voice" has long been recognized as a key driver of leadership trust and organizational effectiveness. Here's Why Research by Ethan Burris of the University of Texas at Austin finds that managers respond positively to staff who use their voice in a way that supports the organization's policies, mission, and culture. Employees not having voice is a problem, says Burris, "and it's not just because employees don't feel like speaking up. There's lots of research that shows when staff don't feel involved in the workplace, they tend to withdraw." Burris' body of research, entitled "The Risks and Rewards of Speaking Up: Responses to Employee Voice," suggests that those employees who do speak up or challenge the status quo, unfortunately, are perceived to be less competent and less committed to their organizations. In an era where 70 percent of employees are disengaged and employees don't trust their top bosses, employees need more than an "open door policy" in order to feel safe to speak up, contribute, and give their best effort. Remember This Google Story? Back in 2010, Google implemented a policy that provided extra payments to same-sex couples to cover the additional income tax they had to pay for health benefits received by a domestic partner. But this didn't happen until a "Googler" emailed the VP of Benefits to voice opinion and explain that the policy was unfair. Google said, "You're right," and changed it. As is the case, Google became one of the first corporate giants to do so, setting the stage for others to follow. When pressed by the New York Times about the cost to Google, Laszlo Bock, Google's HR boss, declined to comment and put the focus back on the principle of it all--equalizing benefits for all Googlers. "If you were to add it all up, it's not like we are talking hundreds of thousands per employee. It will cost some money, but it was more about doing the right thing," said Bock. Give Voice to Employees the ACUITY Way Property/casualty insurer ACUITY, a $1.2 billion giant with 1110 employees, has made Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work for list two years in a row. Quite a number of factors helped them make the list, including things like unlimited education reimbursement, flexible schedules, even casual lunches with executives where they share the company's goals with you. All in the name of building employee loyalty. How do they give voice? ACUITY's senior leaders allow employees to participate in annual strategic planning. Employees actually have the freedom to decide on which charity organizations ACUITY donates to, and they have donated over $12 million dollars the last eight years. As you may imagine, ACUITY has really high employee ratings on their bosses and work environment. This has led to an incredible 2 percent voluntary turnover. Their secret sauce is having created a culture that is built on trust and respect because their employees have voice in really important decisions. Closing Thoughts Affirming Burris' research, voice has shown positive effects of employees speaking up on decision quality, team performance, and organizational performance. But there are prerequisites. It will take having a healthy, people-centered, work culture in place where values like openness, trust, and transparency are woven into the very fabric of how people communicate and relate. This can only start with the top of the food chain designing and implementing ways to value and empower their employees. Like this column?

STRATEGY What Google Really Wants: 7 New Insights That Will Change the Way You Create Content Forget (almost) everything you think you know about SEO, and get the expert take on Google's latest search engine algorithm updates. By Amanda Pressner Kreuser Amanda Pressner Kreuser is co-founder and managing partner at Masthead Media, a full-service media company that provides editorial-quality content services, digital strategy, and media influencer programs customized for brands. @mastheadmedia Co-founder and managing partner, Masthead Media@mastheadmedia WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Confession: I am personally obsessed with all things SEO. And for good reason, too. When the editorial team at my company Masthead Media creates a great piece of content on behalf of a client, we want to make sure that content is positioned to reach and engage with as large of an audience as possible--this is an essential step in ensuring those clients receive a strong ROI. I recently attended the Content Marketing World conference, and--in addition to doing a ton of networking--I had the pleasure of sitting in on Moz founder Rand Fishkin's presentation on the biggest SEO trends of the year. SEO-optimization is an ever-evolving beast, and the new trends Fishkin presented are game changers. While landing at the top of a Search Engine Results Page (SERP) was once primarily about keywords, it's evolved into a more thoughtful process that favors strong, robust content and multimedia. These seven key insights blew my mind, and we've already incorporated them into content strategies of many clients. Read on, and you'll probably want to do the same! 1. Google Search Results Now Read Like Spoiler Alerts In a change reflective of making desktop search mirror mobile platforms, Google now puts more answers to questions right at the top of the SERP, meaning clicking on a third-party link (read: your carefully SEO-optimized blog post) is not always necessary. The takeaway There are two approaches ensure this shift actually drive traffic to your site. The first is to confirm Google isn't already answering a keyword search right on the results page. If the answer is already there, try a different keyword that only features organic results. The second--which is a traffic boon if done correctly--is to make a play to become a featured snippit by very directly answering the question that people are typing into search engines. You may even beat Wikipedia and other large players if you do it right. Fiskin confirms that in many cases, people still click on the source of an answer, even if the information is displayed on the search engine results page. 2. AdWords is No Longer Reliable Google now rounds their data and presents search volume in a few "buckets" and ranges rather than actual numbers of searches, which makes it harder for Google Keyword Planner--better known as Adwords--to determine if there's a lot of search around a particular keyword term. The downside of this is that it makes it difficult for you to determine if its worth it to "go after" a particular search term. The takeaway Sometimes the answer is a simple one. If you want to know what people are really asking Google, just pull up the search engine and begin typing your potential keyword term. Google will start filling in the blanks around what people are really searching for. If you need real numbers, use the Adword numbers and Google Trends data comparatively (not as standalone indicators), or pay Google Adwords for the exact number of searches around a topic. 3. Even Google is Done With Google+ The downfall of Google+ may not be mind-blowing--we've been watching it happen from the beginning!--but even Google doesn't use Google+ anymore. Twitter has replaced the ill-fated + as Google's chosen social media and real time search result, showing up in 6.5 percent of Google SERPs vs. 5.9 just six months ago according to Mozcast. The takeaway Start tuning into how Twitter is used in searches your brand cares about. Engagement and recentness affect Google's display of tweets, so use Twitter to bring you traffic! Don't stop sharing on G+ just yet if you have a big following there, but there is no need to invest any time growing a Google+ following if you don't already have one. Phew! 4.Google Demands Multimedia Only three percent of SERPs display 10 text-only results (think blue links with no images, videos, or sidebars). So while your written content is important, you'll need more than that to search-optimize it. The takeaway To win at search, add "extras" to your content, including well-optimized images, charts, graphs, illustrations, and interactive maps. Make sure your video content is Google-ready, too: the search engine only displays YouTube and Vimeo results for video, so include that in addition to your own player. 5. Google Is Reading Our Minds Thanks to machine learning, Google has figured out exactly what info you're looking for when you type in a search. So, even when you don't type in a "right" keyword phrase, Google can send you to the right place. The takeaway As a marketer, your job is to figure out people's intent in searching--and develop content that directly and masterfully answers their questions. The "winning" content no longer just matches the searchers keywords to your keywords--it the content that best answers the user's question, whether that query is stated or implied. In order to do that, Google looks not only for a specific term in the headline (ie, "top things to do in Paris") or meta description, but also, all of the other terms someone might expect to find in an article that truly answered the question ("Eiffel tour tours, Seine river cruises, etc). 6. Google Will Kill Your Content If People Navigate Away Sneaky click bait isn't going to cut it anymore! Google now looks to see how people react when they click your article from search. If more people abandon it to return to the search engine results page, that bounce rate will push your article down in search ratings. If people stay with it, you content is considered high-quality and will rise in search rankings. The takeaway Keep creating great content, and stay away from click bait titles that are only loosely related to your content. If you really want a page to index before a specific event (e.g., Mother's Day, Christmas) publish it several weeks early. This gives Google enough time to determine if your article is truly valuable--and serve it up to readers during that key period. 7. Your Worst Pages are Killing Your Best Pages You are only as strong as your weakest link...literally. Google will downgrade your site's reputation, and therefore overall ranking on SERPs, if you have too many links that are broken or not getting clicks. The takeaway We often focus on making the "winning" pages on our websites--but rarely look at the pages that get little to no traffic. Run a list of your weakest pages (i.e., those with the highest number of bounces), and periodically update well-performing pages so they continue getting clicks.

It can now be used to add Conversation Actions that provide a way to give your users information, services, and assistance.  The Google Assistant is built in to the Pixel phone, and to Google Home, Google's rival to Amazon Echo that combines search, voice recognition, natural language processing. Users activate the Google Assistant by saying "Ok Google” to get answers and help around the house. Google Assistant uses a wide range of Google technology, from the Knowledge Graph to Natural Language Processing. The new developer platform means you can create applications that interact with the devices - currently only with Google Home, but in the future with Pixel phones and Google Allo.     The actions that have been made available at the moment are Conversation Actions. These can be used to hold a two-way dialog with users. When users request an action, the Google Assistant processes this request, determines the best action to invoke, and invokes your Conversation Action if relevant. From there, your action manages the rest, including how users are greeted, how to fulfill the user's request, and how the conversation ends. Google has worked with a number of companies to provide features for Actions on Google, including conversational interaction development tools API.AI and Gupshup, and analytics tools DashBot and VoiceLabs. There's a Node.js client library that has an Actions SDK and API.AI variant of the library, and you can use the Web simulator to test out your actions and hear the responses the same way you would on a Google Home device. The tool gives you debugging information to diagnose issues and lets you test your experiences before deploying them. If you're developing using the SDK, there's a self-updating command line interface that lets you test and deploy your actions to production. The website also has a collection of samples to get you started. There's also an early adopter program that you can sign up for to be informed as support is added for other platforms.    More Information Early Adopter Program Signup Actions On Google Website Related Articles Google Home Your Personal Assistant New Products For Amazon's Alexa Amazon Opens Up Alexa To Developers and Third Parties Conversation and Cognition at Build 2016    To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.   Firefox Hardware Report 22/12/2016 Mozilla has compiled and published an analysis of the hardware used by a representative sample of Firefox desktop release channel in order to advise its community of web developers about the hardware  [ ... ] + Full Story Action Resulting From Oracle Survey 10/01/2017 At last year's JavaOne Anil Gaur, vice president of Oracle's Cloud Application Foundation group, announced a survey to help determine priorities for the revised road map for Java EE.

The first iPhone was unveiled by Apple's iconic co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs on January on January 9. It was unlike anything the world had seen. But once the world had seen it, people couldn't get enough of it. 10 years later, smartphones -- the real, big-screen smartphones and not the communicators that Nokia and others sold earlier -- are everywhere. The iPhone is arguably the most successful gadget ever launched. Since 2007, it has been the engine powering Apple's stratospheric growth. But billions of dollars in profit that iPhone has brought to Apple is not something why the world remembers it today. The iPhone's legacy is in how it changed the world. It gave birth to smartphones. When Apple launched the iPhone, here is how the company described its new gadget. The introduction is full of Apple's typical hyperbole, but it also proved rather prophetic. iPhone combines three products - a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls, and a breakthrough Internet communications device with desktop-class email, web browsing, maps, and searching - into one small and lightweight handheld device. iPhone also introduces an entirely new user interface based on a large multi-touch display and pioneering new software, letting you control everything with just your fingers. So it ushers in an era of software power and sophistication never before seen in a mobile device, completely redefining what you can do on a mobile phone. Also Read: iPhone 8: Everything you need to know about anniversary-special Apple phone It is quite easy to get carried away while talking about the iPhone and how it changed the world. But all the praise that you heap on it is justified, even if there were areas where it could have done better. It showed that a phone, or for that matter any gadget, can be made without important keys. It was a phone that didn't have the keyboard. It showed that a phone can be good looking -- nay sexy -- and yet be functional. It showed the world that was possible to put the power of a computer, even if in a limited way, into a phone. It showed that even complex functionality can be packed into a device that is simple to use. The iPhone was so different, yet so good, that even Google that was working on Android phones was taken aback and, according to reports, went back to the drawing board The iPhone was so different, yet so good, that even Google that was working on Android phones was taken aback and, according to reports, went back to the drawing board. "Holy crap," Andy Rubin, Android boss at Google, told a colleague after watching Steve Jobs introduce the iPhone to the world. "I guess we're not going to ship that phone." That phone was supposedly a BlackBerry-lookalike Android phone with physical keys. But Google went back to the design lab and then worked on phones that would have full touchscreen, similar to what was there in the iPhone. The iPhone didn't set the benchmark only in 2007. It continued to set them for some time. Nowadays, there are a number of phones with rather great cameras. But it was Apple that realised the importance of the camera in the phone and then focussed on improving it. Apple also showed that design is more than just a case for the phone. World catches up Now, that is a lot of history. The next 10 years for the iPhone may turn out to be less path-breaking. The reason is that world has now caught up to all that was good in the iPhone and in some areas has even started leaving it behind. In 2007, the iPhone changed the world. That is indisputable. In 2017, it needs to change itself. That is also slowly but gradually becoming indisputable. The iPhone, now sold in iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus versions, is still the leader when it comes to the absolute core hardware. It is a phone with very impressive hardware, complete with its unique dual-lens camera (in the iPhone 7 Plus) and colour-accurate screens. But some of the elements, which made it such a superhit among the users, are beginning to feel dated. The Google Pixel phones, for example, have fresher and more versatile software. They offer a more feature-rich experience without compromising on simplicity. With the Google Assistant, they are also more smarter compared to Siri-powered iPhone, especially in the countries like India. Then there are phones like the Galaxy S7 and the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. Both of them are sexier phones in terms of looks compared to the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. These are all little things, but they add up. Overall, the iPhone is still the king of the hill. But the challengers are all around it now, and they are getting closer and closer. The iPhone needs to change this year, especially in terms of its software and the feature set it offers. The good bit is that Apple is also possible thinking on the same lines. While marking the iPhone's 10th anniversary, Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday said: "iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come." These are all little things, but they add up. Overall, the iPhone is still the king of the hill. But the challengers are all around it now, and they are getting closer and closer So far rumours too are hinting at something unique in the iPhone 8 -- or will it be called the iPhone 7S -- that will be released this year. There is a talk of the unique redesign of the phone, the one that will get rid of home button. There is a talk of better camera features and bigger screens. There is the word that the next iPhone may see software that will make better use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. But whatever the changes are coming, it is imperative that they come. After 10 years, for the iPhone the chance is again there to change the world. Yet again.

Voice search is booming. But if you’re smart, these names are old news – you’ve already adjusted digital campaigns to complement more organic, longer tail voice queries. The real question is, are you making the same adjustments for how virtual assistants impact your inbound call strategies? Consumers continue to replace home phones with smart mobile devices, and with that, the rise of voice search has made it easier than ever for consumers to call brands directly. As personal assistants like Google Home and Amazon Echo grow more popular, it’s likely that users will be able to make calls directly from those devices, too. As a result, marketers will see a large spike in inbound call volume. A desktop user, for example, may search for “phone number for Target,” whereas a smartphone user may simply instruct Siri to “call Target near me.” Without the added effort to find and dial phone numbers, consumers will be quicker to call retailers to answer questions. Regardless of how they place the call, once customers get on the phone, brands often miss out on opportunities to track calls and collect crucial information that can elevate the customer experience moving forward. By tracking and recording calls, you can gain a better understanding of who these customers are, where they are calling from, and why they’re calling. This insight can help improve SEO, PPC, and even offline marketing efforts. Multichannel Call Attribution Paints a More Thorough Picture Consumers today interact with brands across multiple channels: television, social media, print ads, videos, and more. And increasingly, consumers are turning to their smartphones as their first point of contact (which is why Google is now shifting to a mobile-first index). We know that if a customer commands Siri to find a phone number for local business, she’s more likely to call – but where is she getting that number from? As we continue to invest in campaigns across channels, many are missing critical information. If customers use voice search to find phone numbers, you’re in the dark about where they found that information without call tracking and phone call recording software. Fortunately, call tracking technology allows marketers to understand where customers saw brand messages and what inspired them to convert. One way to do this is through dynamic phone number tracking. Dynamic Phone Number Tracking Eliminates Confusion To illustrate, say a customer is riding the bus and uses her phone to search for a new dentist to get a dental implant. The customer lands on an optimized dental implants page for a local dentistry, and types in the number listed to call on her smartphone. Without call tracking, there would be no way to track how she found that number and no way to understand the performance of any SEO efforts made on that page. Enter dynamic phone number tracking. Dynamic phone number tracking is a powerful tool that assigns different contact numbers to each visitor or web source, such as Facebook, Yelp, or Google Adwords. This allows marketers to pinpoint exactly where customers received contact information, whether from a served ad, social media page, or another source. Sophisticated dynamic number tracking ensures that each customer sees the same number even if visiting a different online source after their initial point of contact, to avoid any confusion. For example, a customer who first saw a company’s number on a Facebook page would see the same number listed on the brand’s Yelp page. Additionally, brands can use keyword-level call tracking to identify what each visitor searched to find a business online. When visitors search and visit a website, they are assigned a unique phone number that is associated with the keywords they searched and pages they visited. When those visitors call, customer services representatives can see exactly what keywords they used and what channel they landed on before the conversation even begins. For example, a Downtown Dental secretary could know when picking up the phone that the calling found their business through a local SEO page rather than an ad on Facebook. Recorded Phone Calls Uncover Personal Customer Insights With advanced technology that allows brands to mine vast amounts of quantitative data about customer behavior, many marketers overlook critical information that can only come from one place: the customers themselves. Even if you can track how customers initiated mobile calls with voice search from SEO pages or social platforms, you need to go further by listening to the actual calls themselves. Call recording software is often used to train customer service employees, but it’s incredibly useful for marketers. While this may sound like a time-consuming and expensive process, available technology allows marketers to automatically transcribe recordings and quickly pull insights from conversations. Using advanced call recording technology like automated lead classification, marketers can assess the quality of current campaigns, qualify leads that are most likely to convert, and provide valuable feedback to sales representatives. You can then identify patterns to nail down specific actions that make shoppers convert during phone calls (or, similarly, choose not to convert). Additionally, marketers can understand customer preferences while calling to improve their call technology, such as automated menus that can make or break the experience for impatient prospects. Instead of frustrating customers with clunky interfaces, marketers can develop streamlined automated menus unique to their businesses. Investment in efficient, agile customer-facing call technology makes shoppers happy and saves brands time and money by reducing service calls. Invest in Call Tracking Technology for Optimized Marketing Efforts Marketers have access to an overwhelming amount of tools to reach prospects and convert new customers. With so many resources available, the challenge becomes identifying what is effective and what isn’t. You can spend time and money on wide-reaching multi-channel campaigns, but you can’t assess or learn from your efforts without the right attribution capabilities to make sense of your campaigns. To do this, you need to invest in effective call tracking technology that clears up confusion and supports strong campaigns. Otherwise, you risk wasting money and time on strategies that aren’t helping your customers or business goals.

It is only ironic that at CES last week TCL showed off the first phone that's not made by Blackberry and yesterday Nokia announced the 6, which is the first Nokia branded phone that's being made by a company called HMD international. Nokia and BlackBerry essentially don't make phones anymore and if one must pinpoint a singular reason that they don't make phones anymore is because ten years ago, the late Steve Jobs took to the stage at MacWorld 2007 and proclaimed “today, today Apple is going to reinvent the phone." It was the iPhone, and since that day, it has been the basis of what we, essentially call a smartphone -- a candy bar slap of plastic or metal, with a full glass fascia punctuating a full touch screen interface. As he went about announcing the phone, Jobs tantalised the audience and teased them with the possibility of three products, before revealing that he was talking about only a single product. “A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device," said Jobs describing the device, in what many believe to be the greatest keynote of all time. Back then Nokia's best phone was the N95 and BlackBerry was going great guns with its full QWERTY keyboards and class-leading enterprise email. Microsoft was also making a version of Windows which was tailored for touchscreen devices, to be used in conjunction with a stylus. In his keynote, Jobs systematically went about demolishing the status quo and explaining why phones of the time were broken. "The most advanced phones are called smartphones. So they say. They typically combine a phone plus some e-mail capability, plus they say it has the Internet. It's sort of the baby Internet, into one device, and they all have these plastic little keyboards on them. And the problem is that they're not so smart and they're not so easy to use," he said. Jobs pointed out that the big problem with phones was that they had these hardware user interface elements like a full QWERTY keyboard which couldn't be modified for specific applications. He argued that a touchscreen was the way forward but not with a stylus, as they were easy to lose, but instead, the best pointing device for the phone would be our fingers. Today, every smartphone has a full touch interface, using multi-touch technology which Apple popularised with the first iPhone and iPod touch. Even Google which was developing Android at the time was building something that was like BlackBerry, but it halted development and turned Android into something that's closer to iOS on the iPhone. Over the last ten years, the competition may have caught up, but the iPhone remains the pinnacle of what is expected of a mobile computing device. “iPhone is an essential part of our customers' lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO on the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. “iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come," added Cook, who was Apple's Chief Operating Officer in 2007. Cook became CEO of Apple in 2011 after Jobs resigned owing to his illness. Jobs had been suffering from cancer for more than half a decade and soon after resigning, Jobs passed away in October 2011, ironically, a day after the launch of the 5th iPhone — the iPhone 4s. Over the years, the iPhone business has grown by leaps and bounds and as of now, it is bigger than Microsoft, which for many years has been viewed as Apple's arch rival. Despite this, in the ensuing years, Apple's competition has caught up and 2016 marked the first time in the history of the iPhone that the pace of growth went into the negative. This has mostly come from competition powered by Google's Android operating system — this includes new phones under the Blackberry and Nokia brands. The guiding light for the modern computing experience The iPhone remains the benchmark for what one expects of a smartphone. Features that have found their way in an iPhone have become standardised features across smartphones, even cheap smartphones. In some cases, rumours of an impeding feature in an iPhone prompts other manufacturers to preempt. Back in 2008, when Apple added the app store to the iPhone, third party stores existed for Nokia's Symbian OS, BlackBerry's BBOS and even for Microsoft's Windows Mobile. But back in 2008 there was no mobile app economy per se, at least not the way it exists today. Apple literally built it with the App Store. In 2016, App developers on Apple's App Store earned $20 billion; a significant increase of 40 percent from 2015. “2016 was a record-shattering year for the App Store, generating $20 billion for developers, and 2017 is off to a great start with January 1 as the single biggest day ever on the App Store,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. This number is impressive when you consider, the Google Play store caters to even more users. Mary Meeker's internet trends report for 2016 indicates that Apple only has 16 percent of the market share and but thanks to the premium price of the iPhone, Apple dominates the profits of the smartphone industry. "We estimate the global smartphone industry realised total operating profits of US$9.4 billion during Q3 2016. Apple dominated and captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. Apple's ability to maximise pricing and minimise production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits. Huawei, Vivo, and OPPO are the next three most profitable smartphone vendors globally this quarter, but they are still a long way behind Apple," said Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics in November 2016. Apple's influence on the market goes beyond the app store. Back in the day, most smartphones were made from plastic and an industrial version of plastic called polycarbonate. With the iPhone 4, it introduced an industrial design which incorporated metal and glass. Today, metal and glass can be seen, even on phones that cost less than $100. These days, most technology majors talk about machine learning and artificial intelligence as the next frontiers. On mobile, Apple was the first to jump on the boat with its Siri virtual assistant that debuted with the iPhone 4s. Now, an argument can be made that Apple has done little to use that lead, but the fact of the matter is that Apple was the flag-bearer and was soon followed by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. Now, every big tech firm has a virtual assistant of their own. Apple's chief rival in the smartphone space - Samsung has in fact acquired a start-up called Viv which was founded by the folks who created the Siri assistant for Apple. Back in 2013, when Apple introduced the iPhone 5s, it introduced Touch ID. In 2014, it introduced Apple Pay which worked off Touch ID. Now even a phone like the Xiaomi Redmi 3S which costs just Rs 7,000 has a fingerprint scanner. All this has happened in a span of 3-4 years. Between 2015 and 2016, there were numerous instances of the industry following rumours of what Apple intended to do. Dual cameras became mainstream on phones and we also saw instances of phone manufacturers willing to drop the headphone jack from their devices, just because Apple was doing so. It remains to be seen whether these were the right moves, but the fact remains that the industry follows Apple lead. A rough road ahead in emerging markets Apple's towering success in the smartphone space has meant that business has more or less become commoditised. It resembles the PC business. As per Mary Meeker's internet trends report of 2016, global shipments of smartphones have declined drastically. Growth has gone down to 10 percent in 2016 as opposed to 28 percent. As the iPhone is a premium product its penetration in developing markets like India is almost negligible. "Apple's smartphone market share has halved from 4% to just 2% in India during the past year," said Woody Oh, director, Strategy Analytics in August 2016. In China, which is a massive market for Apple it has fallen behind the likes of Huawei, Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomi. Apple only commands 7.1 percent of the market in China in Q3 2016 as per the latest report by IDC. Its market share fell by 34.1 percent in a year, but this report was filed before the launch of the iPhone 7. Regardless, such a dramatic drop is not a good indicator. Apple views India as its next big growth market, but cracking India is not easy. Apple doesn't manufacture its phones in India which means that tax is high,in turn leading to a situation where India is one of the most expensive places in the world to buy an iPhone. In the US the iPhone retails for $649 for the 32GB unlocked model. A rough conversion to Rupees means the price is around Rs 45,000, however, in India the phone is sold for Rs 60,000. For it to manufacture the phones in India, it needs a components ecosystem to be in place, which is just starting to brim up. In India, it doesn't even have its iconic Apple Stores as Indian law stipulates that a single brand owned store should sell products which have sourced at least 30 percent of the materials locally. The iPhones are fully manufactured in China at Foxconn's factories and designed by Apple in California. To reduce the base price of the iPhone, Apple tried selling refurbished phones which were cheaper. This move was squashed by the Indian government. What the future lies ahead Apple is said to be working on many things, but the common view is that the iPhone isn't a groundbreaking product the way it was a couple of years ago. It is now a product that has been refined to death. In 2016 when Apple launched the iPhone 7 which looked identical to the iPhone 6 from 2014, critics were fast to jump on the fact, that Apple was losing its fabled design mojo. But one can expect Apple to have a massive makeover for its 10th anniversary. A new design is a given but more than that Apple's investments in machine learning should pay dividends. Already, with the iPhone 7, Apple is using machine learning in its camera and photo experience. The photos app uses computer vision technology to identify what is in an image, making it easier to search and on the camera, machine learning is used to fuse two images into one enhanced image. In fact, on the iPhone 7 Plus which has two cameras, machine learning is used in the portrait mode. Computational photography, could be the next frontier of imaging on the iPhone. It is easy to predict that in tandem with iterative advances in hardware, Apple could use its advances in artificial intelligence to make a smarter iPhone. Apple has also opened up Siri to developers which should make it ambient across the experience. It has become very serious about AI and recently its scientists even published a paper on their advances in the space of computer vision. Over the last few years, Apple's services business has grown quite steadily. In India, for instance, Apple has opened an office in Hyderabad which is focused on the development of Maps. One should expect Apple to offer a more localised experience to its customers — not just in India, but across the world. Apple has traditionally built experiences that have scaled across markets. This strategy normally works in hardware scenarios, but when you talk about software and services, they have to be localised. Apple has done that well in China and India could be the next big bet, due to the sheer scale of the market. Virtual and Augmented Reality are two spaces that Apple hasn't invested in yet. Tim Cook has already talked about augmented reality. "We are high on AR for the long run," Cook said during an earnings call in 2016. "I think AR can be huge." "Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it's profound. We might … have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they're incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. … You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier," he added. But for a proper push in this space, Apple should enhance the screens on the iPhones and elevate the sensor hub on its gadgets. Apple has already made some big acquisitions in this space - PrimaSense was acquired in 2013, Metaio was acquired in 2015 and Apple even accrued Faceshift, the company behind the real-time motion capture technology in Star Wars. Apple has even hired computer scientists from Oculus and Magic Leap, two companies which are big in the VR and AR space. It also has technological building blocks in place for its current products. For instance, the wide colour display on the iPhone 7 and the dual camera system which can gather stereoscopic data and can create depth maps are essential to a differentiated AR experience. Even its wearables — the Apple Watch and AirPods are spatially aware, which is a prerequisite for an AR experience. The AirPod has the W1 chip which is a wireless chip tied together with two optical sensors, beam forming microphones, an antenna. The Apple Watch has GPS and an accelerometer. Even the iTunes Store and App Store seem like ideal Trojan horses for Apple to deploy a wealth of content for a push into AR. Apple is also said to be working on a driverless car, but that project seems to be sometime away. In the nearer future, the iPhone will remain the most important thing at Cupertino. How important it is and for how long depends on the innovation Apple brings to the table. AR and AI could be the two things that help it to further the needle from a mobile computing point of view.

The potential banishment is being sought in a Labour Department The complaint alleges that Google has repeatedly refused to provide the Labour Department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure the company isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race. The review of how Google pays the thousands of workers at its Mountain View, California, headquarters is allowed under decades-old laws regulating US government contractors. Google has struck a series of deals with various federal government agencies during the past decade, including a digital advertising agreement cited by the Labour Department that has generated more than $600 000 for the company since June 2014, according to the complaint. That amount is a pittance for Google, whose revenue has surpassed $130 billion during the same span. If Google doesn't comply with all its demands, the Labor Department wants a legal order that would void all of the company's current federal government contracts and block future deals. In a statement, Google said it has provided hundreds of thousands of records in an attempt to comply with the Labor Department's requests, but has rebuffed some of the agency's demands as "overbroad" and an invasion of employee privacy.

But Google, which is part of Alphabet, and other tech companies so far have only been disclosing the types of jobs held by the two genders and different races without providing specifics about the salaries in different employment categories. It is well known, though, that programmers and engineers who write the coding for technology products and services are among the highest paid workers besides the companies' executives. The Labour Department maintains that Google agreed to submit to a higher level of scrutiny when it decided to do business with federal agencies funded by taxpayers. "Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation," said Thomas Dowd, acting director of the Labour Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.

The company started pushing its Android 5.0 Lollipop update to select devices and by the end of November, the update had landed for the Nexus 7 2013, Nexus 7 2012, Nexus 5, Nexus 4, and Nexus 10. While the Android 5.0 Lollipop update delivered new features to Nexus users, including Google’s Material Design, it also brought numerous Android 5.0 problems to Nexus smartphones and tablets. Nexus users were extremely vocal about the issues plaguing their devices and fortunately, Google was listening to the pleas. Advertisement Earlier this month, Google pushed out Android 5.0.1 Lollipop, a bug fix update aimed directly at Android 5.0 Lollipop problems. In the days since its arrival, the update has landed for the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 10, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, and the Nexus 7 2013. It’s not a big update in terms of size but it’s an important update given what’s on board. Advertisement Android 5.0.1 Lollipop did not come to the Nexus 7 2012 nor did it come to the cellular versions of the Nexus 7, both of which are still stuck on Android 4.4.4 KitKat. Last week, we may have found out why. On Friday, Google surprised a lot of people with an Android 5.0.2 Lollipop update release into the AOSP. At the time, the update was a bit mysterious though over time, we’ve started to learn a bit more about the company’s new upgrade. Today, we take a look at the five things Nexus users need to know, right now, about Android 5.0.2 Lollipop, Google’s new version of Android 5.0. Android 5.0.2 Lollipop Update The arrival of Android 5.0.2 Lollipop surprised a lot of people. Google just recently started pushing out Android 5.0.1 Lollipop and many times in the past, the company’s stuck to one widespread bug fix roll out. The company has, however, pushed out device-specific updates and it appears that that is what is going on here. So far, the Nexus 7 2012 Android 5.0.2 update is the only Android 5.0.2 update that’s popped up. And while there was a bit of mystery about the update when it first arrived, we now know what to expect from Google’s new Lollipop update. Thanks to the developer change log, we know that the Android 5.0.2 Lollipop update comes with several bug fixes. This shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise given that smaller updates tend to be focused on fixes rather than features. There are some fixes for storage and alarm problems but not much more than that. This, like Android 5.0.1, will be a smaller update. Advertisement The Nexus 7 2012 never got Android 5.0.1 so it’s possible that these fixes and this update will be limited. Google still hasn’t announced anything yet which means that the door is wide open for the future. Remember, the Nexus 7 2013 and Nexus 7 2012 cellular models are still on Android 4.4.4 KitKat. Google still hasn’t pushed Android 5.0 to either device. Android 5.0.2 Lollipop OTA While the Android 5.0.2 Lollipop update is available in the AOSP, the OTA for the public has yet to begin. At least, as far as we know. Typically, the OTA process comes shortly after the factory images arrive in AOSP so we should be looking at a roll out in the near future. Perhaps, as soon as today. Google rarely announces incremental update release dates so Nexus 7 2012 users could be flying, mostly in the dark. Usually, the OTA process is marked by the release of the file from Google’s servers. We still haven’t seen the Nexus 7 2012 Android 5.0.2 Lollipop update OTA file show up yet. When it does show up, Nexus 2012 users will start to see more and more of their brethren get the Android 5.0.2 Lollipop update. There’s just no telling when the OTA might start. You Can Install Now… If you’re familiar with the sideloading process, and you want to skip the OTA process, you can download and flash the update right now. We do not recommend sideloading if you have never done it before. Only those of you with some knowledge of the manual installation process should think about installing the update ahead of the OTA. Advertisement Android 5.0.2 OTA Most of you will want to wait for the OTA to arrive. You can check the settings to see if the update is there but most of you are simply going to want to wait for a notification to show up in the device’s settings. Google’s Android update roll outs typically take a few days, if not a week or more, to deploy completely. So while some Nexus 7 2012 users will get the OTA on day one, others may not get it for five, six, seven days. One thing that you should avoid is the Google Framework Services “trick.” Nexus users used to do this to try and force updates before Google, and the development community, shunned the practice. If you want to know more about this “trick” we suggest heading on over to Google’s website where it outlines some reasons to avoid the trick. Nexus 7 2012 users, you have two options. One, sideload the software. Or two, wait for the Android 5.0.2 Lollipop OTA to arrive. Advertisement Android 5.0.1 Lollipop Still Pushing Out As for those of you with other Nexus devices, note that Android 5.0.1 Lollipop is still pushing out despite the presence of Android 5.0.2. The Nexus 5 Android 5.0.1 Lollipop update is still pushing and the Nexus 6 Android 5.0.1 Lollipop update is still pushing. Both updates should be completed before the end of the year and there’s no guarantee that either device, or any of the other Android 5.0.1 powered Nexus devices, will jump to Android 5.0.2 Lollipop. If you haven’t seen Android 5.0.1 Lollipop arrive just yet and you own a Nexus 7 2013, Nexus 10, Nexus 9, Nexus 6, Nexus 5, or Nexus 4, take a look at our latest roundup. It will get you caught up to speed. For now, assume that you won’t get Android 5.0.2 Lollipop but know that the door is always open for Google to roll out an updated piece of software. 9 Responses 12/30/2014 dstin2014 Reply So many words, so little info 12/30/2014 Justin Reply My wife is still waiting to get lollipop 5.0 ota update on her Nexus 5.

Flat Rock Assembly Plant is seen in Flat Rock, Michigan Chicago - Ford Motor and Toyota Motor have formed a consortium with four medium-size automakers to speed development of auto-industry standards for in-vehicle apps, a step toward preventing Apple Inc. and Google from controlling how drivers connect smartphones to their cars and trucks. Ford and Toyota said Wednesday that Mazda Motor, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki Motor have joined their SmartDeviceLink Consortium. The non-profit group’s goal is to promote more choice in how smartphones get connected to in-vehicle technologies like dashboard displays and voice recognition, and in other programming, Ford and Toyota said in a joint statement Wednesday. Toyota has resisted offering Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto in its vehicles, citing concern that doing so would diminish safety and security. Ford offers them on all its 2017 model vehicles. But the number 2 US automaker still wants an open-source software platform that all app developers can use as an alternative to those of Google and Apple. “Encouraging innovation is at the center of Ford’s decision,’’ said Doug VanDagens, global director of Ford Connected Vehicles and Services. Suppliers Elektrobit Automotive GmbH, Luxoft Holding, and Xevo also joined the consortium, according to the statement. Honda Motor Co. had contemplated the move but wasn’t mentioned in Wednesday’s announcement.

The automakers worry that if CarPlay and Android Auto establish themselves as must-have options, the influence of Apple and Google over the industry will grow. Ford’s version of the SmartDeviceLink technology is already available on five million vehicles globally, and provides drivers with popular apps like Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, and AccuWeather. By enlarging the consortium, the automakers hope to maintain control over how much access infotainment apps have to vehicle data, according to the statement. “We are excited to collaborate with many auto manufacturers who share our view,’’ said Shigeki Tomoyama, president of Toyota’s Connected Company.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Nokia Working On Possible Voice Assistant Called ‘Viki’ By Tyler Lee on 01/09/2017 03:11 PST Apple has Siri, Google has Google Assistant, Microsoft has Cortana, Amazon has Alexa, and last we heard, Samsung has a voice assistant rumored to be called Bixby. However it seems like Nokia doesn’t want to be left out of the loop because thanks to a recent trademark filing, the Finnish company could have a voice assistant of their own in the works. The trademark filing was for a piece of software called “Viki”, which according to the trademark description seems to sound like a voice assistant platform. It reads, “Software for the creation and monitoring of mobile and web digital assistants working with knowledge and combining all data sources into a single chat and voice based interface.” Of course this is merely speculation at the moment but it certainly does sound like Nokia has their own voice assistant planned. We’re not sure when the company plans on launching this voice assistant, but presumably it could launch alongside their flagship smartphone which we’re hoping will be announced at MWC 2017. Recently HMD, the company licensed to build Nokia’s phones, has announced the Nokia 6 Android smartphone. It comes with some decent specs but it is clearly not the flagship, and there was no mention of “Viki” either, but either way check back with us during MWC 2017 next month for the details.

Go is a open source programming language that “makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software”. Tiobe said Go gained the most popularity in 2016 with “hardly any competition”. “Google’s Go language won 2.16% in one year. Runner ups Dart (+0.95%) and Perl (+0.91%) follow at a considerable distance,” stated Tiobe. “The main drivers behind Go’s success are its ease of learning and pragmatic nature. It is not about theoretical concepts such as virtual inheritance and nomads, but about hands-on experience.” The PYPL Index also showed growth for Go, with it gaining 0.2% in market share over the year. New entrants Tiobe also noted that it saw two languages make their debut on the index this past year, Crystal at position 86 and Kotlin at position 87. It added that TypeScript was also gaining in popularity and is “very popular in the commercial industry”. The Tiobe Index is updated monthly and uses the number of skilled engineers worldwide, courses, and third-party vendors available to calculate its ranking. Popular search engines are also used to calculate the ratings.

Mobile usage and search volume continue to surpass desktop, with more smartphones users relying on mobile information whilst on the go. To accommodate this shift, Google has moved towards mobile friendly results across the board, removing the right rail of advertisements from the search engine result page (SERP) and favouring local optimised listings. Google also provided clarity about their search algorithm—naming relevance, proximity, and prominence as the top three factors in search rank—increasing the importance of location reviews in local search. Search results have moved far beyond ten blue links on a page. Through all these changes, a new player has emerged: voice search. >See also: Voice recognition: has AI just beaten a human? Businesses worldwide have invested heavily in adapting to a “mobile-first world.” Today, as we move from mobile-first to yet another new order, what Google CEO Sundar Pichai called an “AI-first world,” one of the most important issues for businesses is how to continue to thrive in an environment where technology is making more and more decisions about their information before the customer even sees it. Voice search is already seizing a high share of search volume. 20% of Google searches and 25% of Windows 10 taskbar searches are voice-based. Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and Google Assistant are becoming global household names. Voice search will only bring forth new players in search at the intersect of information and connected devices. The popularity of Amazon Echo demonstrates this. Voice search fundamentally changes how consumers receive information and how businesses have to approach SEO. These artificial intelligence agents provide a single answer to many queries. “Where is the nearest open coffee shop?” “What is the best hotel in London?” “Find me a highly-rated restaurant in South Kensington, book me a table.” These answers are provided quickly and powered by a complex set of data, allowing AI agents to understand the user’s intent and distinguish between “who” and “what” and “where”. AI agents are able to base their answers on the nuanced preferences of their users, learning from their actions and adapting to their habits. In the coming year, businesses must adapt SEO strategies to face this new normal head on. As Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to perfect AI, businesses will be racing to perfect their search rankings. The key to success? Structured data. Businesses will need to structure their data accordingly so that their brands rank first for specific keywords and attributes. This leaves no room for error and increases competition tenfold. If the answer provided by AI is wrong, customers will not blame the device or search engine, but rather the business itself. >See also: Is voice recognition to become part of enterprise authentication? In fact, today, 8 in 10 UK consumes encounter incorrect location information online and 49% blame the business for these inaccuracies. One wrong piece of information can negatively impact a business for the long run, increasing customer frustration and brand associations. Search engines and artificial intelligence rely on rich, accurate, real-time data to provide consumers with exactly what they are looking for. The more information a business associates with its locations, the better chance it has of appearing high in search rankings. Businesses must undergo the process of collecting and structuring data on their websites and creating search-friendly local pages so that search engines — and ultimately consumers — will find them. While this is all daunting in scope, businesses can take solace that the same knowledge that powers voice search is that which has transformed the SERP: location data. Name, address, description, categories, reviews—this is the same business information surfaced in knowledge graphics and local packs. >See also: Bolstering contact centre security with voice biometrics The key is ensuring this information is consistent across the ecosystem of directories, maps, and apps such that search engines prioritise it. It’s not just retailers and restaurants who will be affected. Local search is how consumers discover doctors, day care centres, financial advisors, and other high-value services. Optimising location data is paramount for any business to compete in an AI-first world. This is a new age of search. 2017 will only bring new advancements and with them, new challenges. One thing is for certain; artificial intelligence is here to stay, and it will transform the world moving forward.   Sourced by Jon Buss, managing director for UK & Northern Europe, Yext Related Topics AI Artificial intelligence (AI) Search Engines Search results Structured data Voice search Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Read More Latest Popular A consensus on consumer data is needed How to manage big data in the age of digital Customer feedback is key to product improvements Have you been caught unawares by the EU GDPR? 2017: the year of real applications Women in IT Awards 2017 – finalists revealed The smart nation: Singapore’s masterplan The path to manageable data Wine cellar, swimming pool and a treehouse: Inside Zoopla’s new office Rolling into the digital age: inside Rolls-Royce’s tech transformation Products Information Age Magazine Since its launch in 1995, Information Age has been regarded as one of the most respected technology titles in the B2B realm.

A recently-passed Russian law requires that any company holding data on Russians house that data within Russia. Russia began blocking LinkedIn's website last November under that law, which some critics argue is an indirect form of censorship. The removal of the LinkedIn app from Apples App Store and Google's Play shows the willingness of major internet gatekeepers to comply with individual nations’ data-control laws, on both the web and mobile devices. Though some American companies have stuck to their free-speech principles when called on to censor content, that resolve could be seen as weakening. In 2010, Google withdrew from China in protest of government surveillance of human rights activists. But Google has begun a limited, government-friendly foray back into China, and has complied with a European “right to be forgotten” law said to prioritize privacy over freedom of speech. Facebook, meanwhile, has been working on filtering tools that would make it friendlier to the Chinese government, though the program is experimental, and the platform is still banned in China.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot January 16, 2017 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Which Google algorithm changes impacted marketers most in 2016 – and what can we expect from 2017? Development Industry Mobile 09 Jan 17 | Rebecca Sentance Facebook0 Linkedin151 Google+23 Twitter 174 Between the long-awaited rollout of Penguin 4.0, a strengthening of Google’s mobile-friendly ranking signal and the ‘Possum’ algorithm update impacting local search, 2016 was an interesting year for Google algorithm changes. And with an upcoming move to a mobile-first search index already on the cards, as well as a penalty for intrusive mobile interstitials coming into effect on the 10th, 2017 promises to be just as eventful. Looking back at 2016, which algorithm changes were the most impactful for marketers in the industry? And how can brands best prepare themselves for what might be around the corner? I spoke to Sastry Rachakonda and Ajay Rama of digital marketing agency iQuanti, along with Search Engine Watch’s regular mobile columnist Andy Favell, to get their thoughts on what’s to come in the search industry. The most impactful algorithm updates of 2016 “Mobile-first indexing is probably the most significant change that happened this year,” said Rachakonda, who is the CEO of iQuanti, a data-driven digital marketing agency, “since companies were creating unique mobile content that was not the same as their desktop content. They did that for user experience. There were smaller snippets that were design friendly, but weren’t relevant and optimal for the search query.” But while Google’s shift to emphasise mobile search even more heavily – which has included a much fuller rollout of Accelerated Mobile Pages into organic search results – was probably its most noteworthy update overall, Rachakonda believes that a different update was actually more impactful from a brand perspective: Possum. ‘Possum’ is the name given to a major update to local search on Google which came into effect on 1st September 2016, and which is thought to be the most significant algorithm update to local search since Pigeon in 2014. The name was coined by Phil Rozek of Local Visibility System, who thought it was fitting as after the update, many business owners thought that their Google My Business listings were gone, when in fact they were only filtered – hence, ‘playing possum’. The apparently ‘dead’ Google My Business listings gave the Possum algorithm update its name. Image via Wikimedia Commons The update seemed mostly aimed at improving the quality of the local search results and removing spammy listings, which meant that some businesses who had engaged in less-than-kosher practices in order to rank found themselves demoted. “Possum has been the most impactful update for brands by far,” said Rachakonda. “One of our Fortune 500 clients in the insurance industry saw a 7% drop in keyword rankings, which resulted in a 13% loss of month-on-month traffic. We believe this was due to some outdated tactics their previous agency used to get them ranked, which clearly Google wasn’t fond of.” While some businesses saw their traffic drop off as a result of Possum, others were seeing a remarkable recovery thanks to Penguin 4.0, which deployed after much anticipation in late September. The original Penguin update in 2012 targeted and devalued inorganic links, such as links which had been bought or placed solely to improve rankings, which led to significant losses in traffic for businesses who had engaged in those practices. As Chuck Price explained in an article for Search Engine Watch in December 2015, “After Penguin, bad links became ‘toxic’, requiring a link audit and removal or disavow of spammy links. Even then, a Penguin refresh was usually required before one could see any signs of recovery.” But thanks to the Penguin 4.0 update in 2016, these refreshes now take place in real-time, leading to significant recovery for brands who had already taken action to remove and disavow the bad links. Marcela De Vivo took a look at how this recovery works in practice, and what site owners can do to improve their situation if they haven’t already done so.

As I mentioned in my introduction, at least two updates in 2017 are already certain, both of them relevant to mobile search. One, Google’s penalty for mobile sites with annoying interstitials, is due to go live tomorrow, and our search news roundup last Friday featured some new clarifications from Google about what kind of interstitials will be affected by the penalty. The other is Google’s move to a mobile-first search index, a major shift which reflects the fact that the majority of Google search queries are now coming from mobile devices. While we don’t yet have a date for this change, Google confirmed in October that the change would take place within the next few months, which means that Google’s primary index could switch to mobile any day now, and brands would do well to prepare themselves. I asked Andy Favell, Search Engine Watch’s resident mobile specialist, what advice he would give to brands who want to be prepared. “Google has done an excellent job of focusing companies’ minds on the importance of having a mobile-friendly website. The stick approach – the fear of harming the search ranking – has worked wonders for driving adoption of mobile or mobile-friendly sites. “However, companies should have been focusing on the carrot – building websites that would appeal to some of the billions of mobile web users out there. The beauty of mobile first is that a mobile-friendly site is often a much better desktop site. That is still true today. “Rather than worrying about trying to make Google happy, brands should concentrate on the mobile users, consider who they are, their context, and what they want, and provide that the best possible way – i.e. intuitive, fast-loading, good UX and usability. Businesses that do this will get more traffic, more happy users and more conversions. “That’s not just good for business, it’s good for your search ranking also. Because Google wants what’s best for the search user.” Brands will need to prepare themselves for mobile search becoming Google’s primary index some time soon in 2017. Those are the changes we know about so far. But what do those in the industry think is coming for search in 2017? Ajay Rama, Senior Vice President of Product at iQuanti, believes that the mobile-first index will take up most of SEO mindshare over the coming year, but he also has a number of predictions for how voice search – which has become a huge part of the search landscape since 2015 – may evolve and change things. “As voice search starts becoming mainstream, we might see the beginning of a SERPless search – search without a SERP page,” predicts Rama. “We could see early tests in this space where we will see Google Assistant and search being seamlessly integrated into an interactive search experience. Assistant interacts with the user to ask the right questions and take him to the target page or a desired action, instead of showing a SERP page with various options. In this new experience, ads would have to be reinvented all over.” Given that Google’s innovations of the past few years, from semantic search to Quick Answers, have increasingly been geared towards understanding users’ exact intentions with the aim of finding a single, ideal result or piece of information to satisfy their query, it’s not hard to imagine this happening. Rama also foresees a much more extensive rollout of Google’s voice-controlled Assistant to go along with this. “Google Assistant will become part of Android, and will be available on all Android devices. Talking to the device in local languages becomes mainstream, and Google Assistant will lead this space. Their machines will learn all accents and all languages, and will soon become a leader in the voice devices, especially in non-English speaking nations.” Can you imagine Google search without the SERP? With the expansion of voice search, it could become a reality. While it’s hard to imagine that all of these developments will take place in 2017 alone, there’s definitely a possibility that we’ll see them begin. Google Assistant is already reported to be learning Hindi as a second language, and more languages could well follow if the uptake of Hindi is a success. However, Google Assistant is fairly late to the game compared to established voice assistants like Siri and Cortana who have been around much longer, and have had more time to refine their technology. So is it still possible for Google to pull ahead in this race? With this change in the way we search comes a change in the way we market, as well; and if the search results page is to disappear one day, advertising will have no choice but to colonise whatever takes its place. We’re already seeing a shift towards an ‘always-on’, always-connected culture with devices like the Amazon Echo constantly listening out for voice commands. Rama believes that Internet of Things-connected devices could easily start to ‘spy’ on their owners, collecting data for the purposes of marketing – “Advertisers would love to get into living room and dinner table discussions.” This might seem like sobering food for thought, or a whole new world of possibilities, depending on your perspective. Either way, it will be extremely interesting to see whether search continues to develop along the path it seems to be taking now – or whether it veers off in other, even more unexpected directions.

PA:Press Association 2 This isn’t your typical Google search, although it is a lot more fun You can search for anything, but the engine won’t show the results for what you just typed in. Instead, it shows the results for what the person just before you searched for – meaning you have no idea what you’re going to get.

That’s because it uses the last person’s input, you could be faced with literally anything when you hit that search button.

The announcement came from John Krafcik, head of Google’s Waymo unit, whose search for partners to develop and install the company’s autonomous driving technology into real cars has so far yielded only an alliance with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and a pending deal with Honda Motor Co. Headlining a future mobility conference during the show’s media preview, Krafcik said Waymo’s latest set of self-driving hardware and software incorporated a new array of sensors, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar, all developed and built in-house. Krafcik said Waymo had reduced the cost of a single lidar unit by 90 percent, to about $7,500. Among major outside suppliers of this technology, Velodyne Lidar Inc and Quanergy Systems Inc both have said they are developing smaller solid-state lidar units that eventually would cost $200 or less. Waymo’s existing test fleet of self-driving cars, including some specially equipped Lexus RX450s and Google’s own “Firefly” prototypes, has accumulated nearly 2.5 million miles in less than eight years, mostly on city streets. Krafcik said Waymo planned to test the first self-driving Pacificas this month on public roads in California and Arizona. He did not say when the system would be ready to install in production vehicles. Delphi Automotive Plc and Mobileye NV have said they are collaborating on a self-driving system that could be sold to automakers beginning in 2019. Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and BMW AG have said they intend to introduce self-driving cars in 2021.

Some of the top flops from 50 years of the Las Vegas show include Digital Audio Tape players, Apple’s Newton handheld computer and Atari’s Jaguar gaming console. Here are some of the more recent disappointments from CES. 1) Smart glasses Google kicked off a wave of optimism about internet-connected eyewear when it unveiled Google Glass at its developer conference in April 2013. At CES in early 2014, there were a bunch on show, including the Epson Moverio BT-200 and Vergence Labs’ Epiphany glasses which let the wearer control drones with hand gestures. As of early 2017, there were no mainstream smart glasses selling in high volumes. Google Glass flopped. Apple Inc is working on the technology, but hasn’t released a product yet. 2) 3D Printers This was the anointed technology at CES 2013. The CubeX from  3D Systems Inc won a Best of CES for emerging technology that year. 3D printers have made steady progress since then, especially for industrial uses, but they aren’t in a lot of homes or offices. MakerBot, a pioneer in the sector that had a strong presence in 2013, has cut staff amid declining sales. Stratasys Ltd bought MakerBot in 2013, and its share price hit a record in January 2014. The stock is down more than 75 per cent since then. 3D Systems shares are down about the same amount in that period. 3) Lily, GoPro drones Startup Lily Robotics won a coveted CES 2016 innovation award for its autonomously steered camera drone. A working version of the gadget wasn’t shown at the conference and shipping dates have been delayed. GoPro Inc founder Nick Woodman took to the stage at the same CES to tease more information about his company’s Karma drone. That gadget finally went on sale in October, but the company recalled thousands of them after they lost power. GoPro was back at CES this year showing off the Karma and the company said it will re-launch the drone later in 2017. 4) Hoverboards At CES 2016, makers of hoverboards battled over which company came up with the technology and related designs. The electric skateboards were gaining in popularity, thanks in part to celebrities like Justin Bieber posting shots of themselves zipping around on the devices. So there was a lot at stake. But things turned sour when US federal marshals raided the CES booth of a Chinese hoverboard maker. Future Motion, a Silicon Valley startup, said it invented and patented a self-balancing electric skateboard that looked strikingly similar to the ones the marshals confiscated. Less than two months later, Amazon.com Inc and other big retailers stopped selling hoverboards after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission deemed them unsafe, saying they “pose an unreasonable risk of fire” if they didn’t meet voluntary safety standards. No hoverboards on the market met those standards, it added at the time. 5) Pebble Pebble Technology Corp was the belle of the CES 2013 ball when the startup announced its smartwatch would ship in late January. The following year its Pebble Steel model made several Best of CES lists including The Verge’s Best Smartwatch. Alas, the company is no more. Struggling under the weight of its debt, the company sold software assets to Fitbit Inc last month. Pebble hardware projects are no more and it isn’t actively supporting existing watches. Too bad for buyers wowed by their showing at CES. 6) Smartwatches At CES 2014, a year after Pebble’s debut, dozens of smartwatches were shown. Google unveiled its Android Wear smartwatch platform a few months later, and Apple announced its Watch in September of that year. The hope was that smartwatches would be the next hot gadget to rival the smartphone. But by the third quarter of 2016, global smartwatch sales were down 52 per cent from a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. 7) The Dell Venue 8 7000 Tablet Calling it the thinnest tablet in the world, CES listed Dell Inc’s Venue 8 device among its 2015 Best of Innovation Award Honorees. It was part of an attempt by Intel Corp. to get its components into more tablets and other mobile devices. The tablet featured an Intel RealSense camera and Atom processor. However, last year Dell stopped selling the tablets. Intel managed to sneak a chip into some of the latest iPhones, but the semiconductor giant still hasn’t cracked mobile. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Samsung to disclose Note 7 probe results on Jan 23 Facebook announces 'fake news' offensive in Germany E-waste rising dangerously in Asia, UN study shows Samsung probe finds battery was main cause of Note 7 fires, source claims Nintendo’s Switch to go on sale March 3 for US$300 (VIDEO) As labour force shrinks, China turns to robots WhatsApp vulnerable to snooping, report says Nintendo’s Switch to go on sale March 3 for US$300 (VIDEO) Bionic woman: Chinese robot turns on the charm Get the pink coins!

The only way you could interact with Google Assistant was by talking to it verbally. Gone was the old way to silently chat with it by typing secret messages. Except in Allo, where text does still rule. That, however, might be changing in the near but still unforeseen future, as Google seems to be paving the way for the return of ye ol’ input box for the Google app. Perhaps Google tried to take a page out of Apple’s book, because Siri definitely doesn’t like talking to keyboards. But speaking aloud, at least loud enough for these assistants to hear, isn’t always advisable all the time. Some occasions require you to be more discreet. Other times, your mouth might be too preoccupied. Whatever the reason, it’s always good to have a fallback on being able to type out what you want. And good thing Google finally agrees. It’s not known exactly when this change will take place. Google has certainly kept silent about it. Only clues buried within the APK of a beta version of the Google search app hints as much. Given that’s still an unreleased thing, Google might still change its mind later on. But at its own risk, since the cat is already out of the bag. Another change that’s coming, but this time already pre-announced, is Google Assistant support on Android Wear. To some extent, it’s a no-brainer, since Assistant replaces the aging Google Now anyway. It’s actually more surprising in the sense that Android Wear is still being supported after all. Snarkasm aside, again no final word yet on when this switch will be flipped. Android Wear users are probably more eager for Android Wear 2.0 first anyway. Google definitely seems to be revving up the engines of Google Assistant and rightly so. If there’s one thing that CES 2017 shows, it’s that Alexa has become the darling of the voice-controlled personal assistant market. Left and right you will hear about this or that device, even cars, integrating with Amazon’s assistant. Google Assistant definitely needs to spread its wings faster and farther if it wants to stay relevant in this space.

The Latest New Products Must-See Join CNET Member Benefits Sign In to CNET My Profile Forums Sign Out Australia China France Germany Japan Korea United Kingdom US Editions English Español Accept your fate: You can't escape the smart home Analysis: The long-predicted connected home of the future finally felt ubiquitous at CES 2017. The good news? You may actually love it. Smart Home by Rich Brown January 8, 2017 2:18 PM PST @rh_brown Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home Yes, Alexa is everywhere. You have only to look at our CES 2017 Smart Home Scoreboard to see how Amazon has married its virtual assistant to cars, refrigerators, televisions and robots. Alexa's momentum isn't surprising given the amount of hype over the last year. For Alexa's competition, Google Assistant is still new as a smart home assistant, and Apple is sticking to its slow-burn approach to growing Siri and its iOS HomeKit platform. That's why our Scoreboard has a loose quality breakdown. I didn't want to simply hand Amazon a prize for supporting yet another smart plug. Alexa takes form at CES 2017.Photo by Chris Monroe/CNET Hopefully also evident from the Scoreboard (or, perhaps, "smart home potential meter") is the breadth of categories in which you will now find these voice assistants. That expansion will help transform the experience from its current Internet of Things grab bag -- the junk drawer full of connected motion sensors, thermostats and light switches -- to a more pervasive experience that will follow us wherever we go (for better or worse). Done right, and our lives become easier and safer, with more time for the things we truly care about. Implemented carelessly, this new connected world will threaten our notions of privacy and personal safety. The reality will ultimately land somewhere in the middle. That outcome will be shaped by what we saw in Las Vegas this past week. Here are the highlights. Ford is first to bring Alexa into the passenger seat Alexa's road trip with Ford brings the cloud a little closer to your car. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 1:48 Close Drag Automotive This is the category I was most interested to see at this year's show. Ford and Toyota both hinted at bringing Alexa to their respective in-car experiences at 2016's CES, and this year Ford delivered. I sat with my colleagues Wayne Cunningham and Ben Fox Rubin inside a Ford C-Max while a company representative demonstrated using Amazon's increasingly ubiquitous voice-command assistant, but the experience was underwhelming. The car was parked inside the Las Vegas Convention Center. The software is still in beta so not every command worked well. Ford had no smart home stuff for Alexa to control. Hyundai and Chrysler had Google Home and Google Assistant integrations of their own here at the show, too. Chrysler's was just a concept. Hyundai lets you ask Google Home to start your car, flash the lights, or provide directions to your house, and then send the route to your in-car navigation system. Handy, but not the same as dictating commands to your home from the inside of your car. But regardless of this somewhat halting start on the ground in Vegas, that's exactly what's happening: Tell your home to crank up the air conditioner, start the coffee brewing and raise the garage door -- all from the comfort of the driver's or passenger seat. It will eliminate driving a car as a weak point in the chain of control over your home -- but it'll also add another set of in-car distractions. Nvidia Shield gets Amazon video, improved gaming and Google Assistant The all-new, do-it-all video box gets a bunch of improvements and keeps the same $200 price (which converts to £161 or AU$272). by David Katzmaier 2:09 Close Drag Home entertainment Centralizing voice and smart home around the TV is utterly obvious, and yet somehow no one has combined all of the pieces into a single, unified product. Shame on Samsung in particular, who is best positioned to do this given its Alexa-supporting SmartThings division, and yet somehow has not. Related link To see how all of this works together, check out our Ultimate Smart Home Compatibility Guide Nvidia's new Shield TV streamer doesn't have a screen, but it might be the best solution when it ships on January 16. It brings gaming, video streaming, SmartThings compatibility (via extra $30 dongle -- converted to £24 or AU$41), and always-listening voice help from a remote that works with Google Assistant. No other streaming device, not even Apple TV, offers that same combination of smart home control with an always-listening voice assistant to control your home entertainment. A trio of budget TV brands -- Element, Seiki and Westinghouse -- also made some voice control progress. Their new televisions have Amazon's Fire TV service built-in, and they included the same voice remote that lets you use Alexa to turn on the TV, change inputs, change channels, and navigate among the usual assortment of streaming services. Logitech's Harmony remotes and the Amazon Fire TV also bring Alexa to your TV, but built-in methods are usually easier and cheaper. It will take deeper integration between products to truly marry your smart home and your television. My near-term holy grail (besides verbally flipping channels) remains a video doorbell feed transmitted automatically to your TV with two-way audio support when someone comes to your front door. Maybe next year. Also: Don't sleep on the cable companies and other service providers who have entered the smart home field. Comcast in particular is taking this market very seriously. LG's see-through smart fridge takes the CES stage It just wouldn't be CES without touchscreen smart refrigerators -- and this year, LG brought one with Alexa built right in. by Ry Crist 1:02 Close Drag Kitchen and appliances Samsung promised it would add Alexa to the touchscreen-equipped Family Hub refrigerator at CES last year. This year LG beat Samsung to the punch. On the whole, LG's Smart Instaview fridge feels like a copycat product to Samsung's Family Hub, from the touchscreen and its various home organization and shopping apps to the cameras inside that let you view the contents remotely. LG's Instaview gimmick is unique -- knock on the screen and it goes translucent, letting you look inside that way, too. Incorporating Alexa into a multi-thousand dollar refrigerator doesn't seem to get you anything different than plunking down a $50 Echo Dot. Still, I wonder if putting Alexa in a fridge won't make Amazon's shopping services (including Amazon Fresh groceries) feel a little more immediate when you're staring into it wondering what to make for dinner. As for Samsung, Alexa has fallen out of favor as a voice assistant. Alexa never came to Family Hub 1.0. The 2.0 version, announced this week, will come with unspecified "advanced voice technology." Is it Samsung's old S-Talk Android voice recognition? Is this what Samsung has in mind for its new voice acquisition, Viv? Samsung gave no specifics during its presentation nor would its US appliance division exec, John Herrington, comment when I asked him directly. For the rest of the appliance landscape, small appliance maker Gourmia brought Alexa to an entire suite of countertop gadgets. Whirlpool and GE rolled out Alexa integrations across their large appliances, with special Alexa-specific commands like preheating the oven, or asking how much time is left on a dishwasher cycle. Not as flashy as a touchscreen on a fridge, but certainly more practical. Hands on with Kuri -- an adorable wandering security cam Imagine if you had a cartoon character roaming your floors, watching your kids and telling them stories -- that's Kuri. by Andrew Gebhart 1:40 Close Drag Home assistants The list of either static or mobile home companion devices was surprisingly robust this year. Two stand out. Among the flood of baby and parenting-focused tech, Mattel's Aristotle is one of the most ambitious thanks to its split personality. Yes, it's another smart speaker with Alexa built into it. But prompt it with "Hey, Aristotle" instead, and you or your kids engage its alter-ego. Among Aristotle's tricks, it can sing a baby back to sleep, read from a list of books, play games. It even has a manners option that requires your kids to say "please" before it will acknowledge a request. If that's not enough, it also comes with a camera for keeping an eye on your kid's room, a bracelet option to help track if your child has completed his or her chores, and of course, the ability to trigger sound effects with compatible Mattel toys. Real-world parents, presumably, are sitting in the next room with their feet up while Aristotle doles out the life lessons. Kuri, from Mayfield Robotics, looks like a refugee from Pixar's "WALL-E." It seems to have its own voice control tech (other robots use Alexa). But most importantly, it's got a ton of charm. Cute-eyed Kuri will toddle along on the floor, patrolling the halls with its camera. It an play music and podcasts, tell you the weather, and even, supposedly, recognize faces. I'm skeptical of the market for free roaming bots that aren't vacuums. The utility doesn't seem to be there yet to sway city dwellers to let a floor drone mess up the already cramped flow of a 1,000 square foot apartment. But years ago, Sony's Aibo showed that consumers can fall in love with a robot. For those with the square footage to spare, Kuri looks to have that kind of appeal. 57 Check out all the smart home products at CES 2017 (so far) Apple's long smart home shadow Alongside these larger trends, the more traditional smart home hardware -- lights, switches, locks -- were present here too. If you didn't hear much from Apple and its HomeKit smart home service at the show, it's because most of its news centered on these kinds of products, which aren't as flashy as cars and fridges and robots. Apple expanded its reach this year, as usual, via its partners, who introduced cameras, security systems, and, finally, a Chamberlain garage door opener to its platform. That's all new stuff that will make HomeKit even more capable. The big question for Apple remains whether it will bring out its own Echo or Google Home competitor to add a truly seamless voice companion to the home environment. Until that happens, or until Apple introduces a better alternative, I suspect HomeKit won't benefit as much from the present hype surrounding voice control at home. That may not matter in the long run. It's still morning in the smart home. But it won't be forever.

You have only to look at our CES 2017 Smart Home Scoreboard to see how Amazon has married its virtual assistant to cars, refrigerators, televisionsand robots. Alexa's momentum isn't surprising given the amount of hype over the last year. For Alexa's competition, Google Assistant is still new as a smart home assistant, and Apple is sticking to its slow-burn approach to growing Siri and its iOS HomeKit platform. That's why our Scoreboard has a loose quality breakdown. I didn't want to simply hand Amazon a prize for supporting yet another smart plug. Hopefully also evident from the Scoreboard (or, perhaps, "smart home potential meter") is the breadth of categories in which you will now find these voice assistants. That expansion will help transform the experience from its current Internet of Things grab bag -- the junk drawer full of connected motion sensors, thermostats and light switches -- to a more pervasive experience that will follow us wherever we go (for better or worse). Done right, and our lives become easier and safer, with more time for the things we truly care about. Implemented carelessly, this new connected world will threaten our notions of privacy and personal safety. The reality will ultimately land somewhere in the middle. That outcome will be shaped by what we saw in Las Vegas this past week. Here are the highlights. Automotive This is the category I was most interested to see at this year's show. Ford and Toyota both hinted at bringing Alexa to their respective in-car experiences at 2016's CES, and this year Ford delivered.  I sat with my colleagues Wayne Cunningham and Ben Fox Rubin inside a Ford C-Max while a company representative demonstrated using Amazon's increasingly ubiquitous voice-command assistant, but the experience was underwhelming. The car was parked inside the Las Vegas Convention Center. The software is still in beta so not every command worked well. Ford had no smart home stuff for Alexa to control. Hyundai and Chrysler had Google Home and Google Assistant integrations of their own here at the show, too. Chrysler's was just a concept. Hyundai lets you ask Google Home to start your car, flash the lights, or provide directions to your house, and then send the route to your in-car navigation system. Handy, but not the same as dictating commands to your home from the inside of your car. But regardless of this somewhat halting start on the ground in Vegas, that's exactly what's happening: Tell your home to crank up the air conditioner, start the coffee brewing and raise the garage door -- all from the comfort of the driver's or passenger seat. It will eliminate driving a car as a weak point in the chain of control over your home -- but it'll also add another set of in-car distractions. Home entertainment Centralizing voice and smart home around the TV is utterly obvious, and yet somehow no one has combined all of the pieces into a single, unified product. Shame on Samsung in particular, who is best positioned to do this given its Alexa-supporting SmartThings division, and yet somehow has not. Nvidia's new Shield TV streamer doesn't have a screen, but it might be the best solution when it ships on January 16. It brings gaming, video streaming, SmartThings compatibility (via extra $30 dongle -- converted to £24 or AU$41)), and always-listening voice help from a remote that works with Google Assistant. No other streaming device, not even Apple TV, offers that same combination of smart home control with an always-listening voice assistant to control your home entertainment. A trio of budget TV brands -- Element, Seiki and Westinghouse -- also made some voice control progress. Their new televisions have Amazon's Fire TV service built-in, and they included the same voice remote that lets you use Alexa to turn on the TV, change inputs, change channels, and navigate among the usual assortment of streaming services. Logitech's Harmony remotes and the Amazon Fire TV also bring Alexa to your TV, but built-in methods are usually easier and cheaper. It will take deeper integration between products to truly marry your smart home and your television. My near-term holy grail (besides verbally flipping channels) remains a video doorbell feed transmitted automatically to your TV with two-way audio support when someone comes to your front door. Maybe next year. Also: Don't sleep on the cable companies and other service providers who have entered the smart home field. Comcast in particular is taking this market very seriously. Kitchen and appliances Samsung promised it would add Alexa to the touchscreen-equipped Family Hub refrigerator at CES last year. This year LG beat Samsung to the punch. On the whole, LG's Smart Instaview fridge feels like a copycat product to Samsung's Family Hub, from the touchscreen and its various home organization and shopping apps to the cameras inside that let you view the contents remotely. LG's Instaview gimmick is unique -- knock on the screen and it goes translucent, letting you look inside that way, too. Incorporating Alexa into a multi-thousand dollar refrigerator doesn't seem to get you anything different than plunking down a $50 Echo Dot. Still, I wonder if putting Alexa in a fridge won't make Amazon's shopping services (including Amazon Fresh groceries) feel a little more immediate when you're staring into it wondering what to make for dinner. As for Samsung, Alexa has fallen out of favor as a voice assistant. Alexa never came to Family Hub 1.0. The 2.0 version, announced this week, will come with unspecified "advanced voice technology." Is it Samsung's old S-Talk Android voice recognition. Is this what Samsung has in mind for its new voice acquisition, Viv? Samsung gave no specifics during its presentation nor would its US appliance division exec, John Herrington, comment when I asked him directly. For the rest of the appliance landscape, small appliance maker Gourmia brought Alexa to an entire suite of countertop gadgets. Whirlpool and GE rolled out Alexa integrations across their large appliances, with special Alexa-specific commands like preheating the oven, or asking how much time is left on a dishwasher cycle. Not as flashy as a touchscreen on a fridge, but certainly more practical. Home assistants The list of either static or mobile home companion devices was surprisingly robust this year. Two stand out. Among the flood of baby and parenting-focused tech, Mattel's Aristotle is one of the most ambitious thanks to its split personality. Yes, it's another smart speaker with Alexa built into it. But prompt it with "Hey, Aristotle" instead, and you or your kids engage its alter-ego. Among Aristotle's tricks, it can sing a baby back to sleep, read from a list of books, play games. It even has a manners option that requires your kids to say "please" before it will acknowledge a request. If that's not enough, it also comes with a camera for keeping an eye on your kid's room, a bracelet option to help track if your child has completed his or her chores, and of course, the ability to trigger sound effects with compatible Mattel toys. Real-world parents, presumably, are sitting in the next room with their feet up while Aristotle doles out the life lessons. Kuri , from Mayfield Robotics, looks like a refugee from Pixar's "WALL-E." It seems to have its own voice control tech (other robots use Alexa). But most importantly, it's got a ton of charm. Cute-eyed Kuri will toddle along on the floor, patrolling the halls with its camera. It an play music and podcasts, tell you the weather, and even, supposedly, recognize faces. I'm skeptical of the market for free roaming bots that aren't vacuums. The utility doesn't seem to be there yet to sway city dwellers to let a floor drone mess up the already cramped flow of a 1,000 square foot apartment. But years ago, Sony's Aibo showed that consumers can fall in love with a robot. For those with the square footage to spare, Kuri looks to have that kind of appeal. Apple's long smart home shadow Alongside these larger trends, the more traditional smart home hardware -- lights, switches, locks -- were present here too. If you didn't hear much from Apple and its HomeKit smart home service at the show, it's because most of its news centered on these kinds of products, which aren't as flashy as cars and fridges and robots. Apple expanded its reach this year, as usual, via its partners, who introduced cameras, security systems, and, finally, a Chamberlain garage door opener to its platform. That's all new stuff that will make HomeKit even more capable. The big question for Apple remains whether it will bring out its own Echo or Google Home competitor to add a truly seamless voice companion to the home environment. Until that happens, or until Apple introduces a better alternative, I suspect HomeKit won't benefit as much from the present hype surrounding voice control at home. That may not matter in the long run. It's still morning in the smart home. But it won't be forever.

After announcing its first smartphone from the comeback lineup, the Nokia 6, seems like the company is working on more than just smartphones for the year 2017. As per the latest reports, the Finnish company is reportedly working on its own AI-powered assistant named 'Viki' which the company is expected to integrate with its future launches. Spotted first by GSMinfo, Nokia has recently applied for a trademark in EU with the name 'Viki'. The trademark application reads - "software for the creation and monitoring of mobile and web assistants working with digital knowledge and combining all data sources into a single chat and voice-based interface." With an AI-powered personal assistant, Nokia will be head to head against the likes of Google (Google Assistant), Apple (Siri) and Windows (Cortana). Further, Samsung is also reportedly working on its own AI-based voice assistant named Bixby which the company is expected to release with the Galaxy S8. According to a report by Sammobile, the AI assistant will be much more advanced than its current S Voice virtual assistant. Quoting an example, one can ask Bixby to filter out and show specific pictures or videos while he/she navigates through the Gallery app. Further, similar to Google Assistant or Apple's Siri, Bixby will pop up contextual answers as well. On the other hand, it will be interesting to see what Nokia has in store in terms of voice-assistant as we have to admit, that the road to the best voice assistant is now a lot bumpier after Google came up with its own Google Assistant last year. Meanwhile, HMD Global yesterday announced the launch of its first-ever Nokia smartphone - the Nokia 6. The device comes with a 5.5-inch full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) 2.5D curved glass display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection and comes equipped with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 (4 x 1.2 GHz Cortex A53 + 4 x 1.5GHz Cortex A53) processor, along with Adreno 505 GPU. It comes with 4GB of RAM, and 64GB internal storage, which can be further expandable up to 128GB via microSD. It also houses a fingerprint scanner, which is embedded in its home button.

Well, out of the expected launches, one smartphone is out and one of them is expected to be the Nokia D1C while we would recommend you to stay updated on our website for further updates on the upcoming launches.

First autonomous Waymo/Chrysler vans are coming to public roads this month Waymo - formerly the Google Car project - and Fiat Chrysler have announced that their self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans will come to public roads in the USA later this month (The Verge). The news came at the North American International Auto Show, where Waymo also said that, for the first time, it has produced all the self-driving technology that goes into the cars itself, from cameras to sensors, as well as the software that guides the vehicles. The minivans will be tested on roads in Mountain View, California and Phoenix, Arizona, where previous generations of Google vehicles have already been tested.

Uber offers traffic data to aid city planners Uber has announced that it will be sharing detailed traffic data from the cities in which it operates with metropolitan planners, researchers, and - in the near future - the general public (WIRED US). The data service, dubbed Movement, is something of a peace offering to cities where the app-based taxi operator has found itself at loggerheads with authorities, and will allow travel time between points to be calculated for any given time of day, revealing potential bottlenecks in road networks. Andrew Salzberg, Uber’s chief of transportation policy said that "we don’t manage streets. We don’t plan infrastructure. So why have this stuff bottled up when it can provide immense value to the cities we’re working in?" 3. Tim Cook takes a pay cut following disappointing 2016 performance from Apple Apple executives, including CEO Tim Cook, will be taking pay cuts after the company missed revenue and operating income targets for 2016 (TechCrunch). The CEO will be taking a 15 per cent pay cut, giving him an income of $8.75 million, compared to his 2015 compensation of $10.3 million. 2016 is the first year since 2009 that the company has missed its internal targets. However, with 2017 marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, Apple's stock market value has been largely unaffected by last year's muted performance. 4. Prior exposure to Dengue virus could make Zika more lethal Scientists at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) have been looking into the effect of the Dengue virus antibodies and how this may worsen Zika infection (WIRED). According to the WHO, Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected female Aedes mosquito, which also spreads Zika. It is a flu-like illness and severe Dengue can be lethal. There is no official vaccine or specific medication to treat the virus. Professor of Biological Sciences at FGCU, Sharon Isern studies the viruses in the Flavivirus family including Zika and Dengue. Writing for The Conversation, Isern explained the work her and her colleagues carried out when looking into whether having an immunity to Dengue from an earlier infection could make having a Zika infection worse.

Iranian internet censorship takes out popular porn sites for other countries Iranian state telecom's attempt to block 256 online porn sites had the spectacularly heavy-handed side-effect of taking them out for a number of other countries as well (The Verge). The state internet provider published phoney routes to the sites, directing users who attempted to visit them to a blank page. However, a number of other countries' internet providers started automatically attempting to use these seemingly short routes to the sites, including major ISPs such as Omantel, Hong Kong’s Hutchison and Russia’s RETN. The ISPs have now begun blocking the bad routes, allowing pornography's normal service to resume, for users outside Iran, at least. 6. It would take just 100 days for a zombie infection to decimate the world's population A real-life zombie outbreak would leave the world’s population in tatters, with fewer than 300 survivors left just 100 days into the infection, according to the University of Leicester (WIRED). Assuming a zombie can find one person each day, with a 90 per cent chance of infecting victims with the zombie infection, the students from the University of Leicester Department of Physics and Astronomy suggest that by day one hundred there would be just 273 remaining human survivors, outnumbered a million-to-one by the undead. The students presented their findings in a series of short articles for the Journal of Physics Special Topics, a peer-reviewed student journal run by the university’s Department of Physics and Astronomy. The student-run journal is designed to give students practical experience of writing, editing, publishing and reviewing scientific papers. 7. Eating peanut butter early protects infants from allergies in later life A study carried out by researchers at King's College London has found that at-risk babies can be prevented from developing potentially fatal peanut allergies by feeding them peanut butter early in their lives (Science Alert). This is a marked departure from previous advice, which recommended that peanut butter be withheld from all infants until three years of age. America's National Institutes of Health has announced that it's changing its healthcare guidelines in response to the findings, which recommend that babies in high risk categories – those who have already developed eczema or an egg allergy – be fed peanut butter as early as four months of age to prevent allergies from developing through exposure to small quantities of airborne peanut proteins.

Hardware hackers load new games onto the NES Classic The enthusiastic modding community for Nintendo's NES Classic mini-console has worked out a method of loading new games onto the console (Ars Technica). The miniaturised NES was one of 2016's top Christmas gifts, even though the mini-console was designed to only ever be able to play the 30 games it came with. However, with the help of a USB connection to offload and copy back the console's firmware, users who are prepared to experiment at their own risk can add new game ROMs of their own choosing thanks to a software tool. 9. Sanrio's latest character is a jaded, office working, black metal loving red panda Following a Twitter push from Hello Kitty creator Sanrio, the world has fallen in love with one of the company's latest creations, Aggretsuko (Polygon). She's a red panda with a soul-destroying office job that sees her surrounded by ingrates, who turns into a corpse-painted black metal singer to express her inner rage. You can make her acquaintance through a video published to Twitter, while fan subs of a 10-episode short cartoon series about her remarkably relatable exploits are available on various video sites. 10. Netflix has released a browser game inspired by its top shows Netflix has released an infinite runner style browser game inspired by hit shows Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, Marco Polo and Narcos (Engadget). Each of the available characters races through a level based on their own show, with Stranger Things' Mike Wheeler having to avoid capture by Hawkins National Laboratory staff and evade the Demogorgon. The game isn't what you'd call deep, but provides a welcome few minutes' distraction as you use the spacebar to jump and double-jump away from danger.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google January 05, 2017 Google, Microsoft, labs and start-ups will create universal quantum computers in 2017 and achieve quantum supremacy over classical computers dwave, google, microsoft, quantum computers, qubits, superconductor Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit Google started working on a form of quantum computing that harnesses superconductivity in 2014. In 2017 or 2018 Google hopes to perform a computation that is beyond even the most powerful ‘classical’ supercomputers — an elusive milestone known as quantum supremacy. Its rival, Microsoft, is betting on an intriguing but unproven concept, topological quantum computing, and hopes to perform a first demonstration of the technology. The quantum-computing start-up scene is also heating up. Christopher Monroe, co-founded the start-up IonQ in 2015, plans to begin hiring in earnest this year. Physicist Robert Schoelkopf at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who co-founded the start-up Quantum Circuits, and former IBM applied physicist Chad Rigetti, who set up Rigetti in Berkeley, California, say they expect to reach crucial technical milestones soon. The largest trapped ion quantum computer with 20 qubits is being tested in an academic lab led by Rainer Blatt at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. In 2016, Rainer Blatt's and Peter Zoller's research teams have simulated lattice gauge theories in a trapped ion quantum computer. Gauge theories describe the interaction between elementary particles, such as quarks and gluons, and they are the basis for our understanding of fundamental processes. "Dynamical processes, for example, the collision of elementary particles or the spontaneous creation of particle-antiparticle pairs, are extremely difficult to investigate," explains Christine Muschik, theoretical physicist at the IQOQI. "However, scientists quickly reach a limit when processing numerical calculations on classical computers. For this reason, it has been proposed to simulate these processes by using a programmable quantum system." The two leading approaches to quantum computers are superconducting loops or trapped ion. Schoelkopf helped to pioneered superconducting loop quantum computers and which Google, IBM, Rigetti and Quantum Circuits have adopted. This involves encoding quantum states as oscillating currents in superconducting loops. IonQ and several major academic labs, encode qubits in single ions held by electric and magnetic fields in vacuum traps. John Martinis, who worked at the University of California, Santa Barbara, until Google hired him and his research group in 2014, says that the maturity of superconducting tech­nology prompted his team to set the bold goal of quantum supremacy. The team plans to achieve this using a ‘chaotic’ quantum algorithm that produces what looks like a random output. If the algorithm is run on a quantum computer made of relatively few qubits, a classical machine can predict its output. But once the quantum machine gets close to about 50 qubits, even the largest classical supercomputers will fail to keep pace IonQ aims to build trapped ion machines that have 32 or even 64 qubits. The ion-trap technology will enable their designs to be more flexible and scalable than superconducting circuits, he says. The people running IonQ have industry heavyweights taking notice. The firm’s founders have received about $64 million in government research funding to date. After years of badgering the IonQ founders to step into the venture capital space, Weller helped put together a team from some of the highest reaches of government and business. At Weller’s urging, New Enterprise Associates made a $2 million investment to help the firm develop a marketable product. Microsoft, meanwhile, is betting on the technology that has the most to prove. Topological quantum computing depends on excitations of matter that encode infor­mation by tangling around each other like braids. Information stored in these qubits would be much more resistant to outside disturbance than are other technologies and would, in particular, make error correction easier. D-Wave Systems has led the market in selling the quantum computing systems. They sell adiabatic superconducting systems for about $10 million apiece.

Image: Kichigin/Shutterstock In another example of state cooperation on censorship, both Apple and Google have agreed to remove the LinkedIn app from iOS and Android stores, following the social network’s ban in Russia. Last November, Russian LinkedIn users suddenly found themselves unable to access the business social network in an apparent censorship attempt by Vladimir Putin’s government. In a statement following the decision, the country demanded that all of its citizens’ data held by the website must be stored within its own borders. Despite an apparent willingness from LinkedIn to cooperate in some aspects (but not all), Russia closed access to the site, which has so far been upheld. Now, according to The New York Times, Apple and Google have agreed to erase its presence entirely from Russia by removing the LinkedIn app from both of its stores. While access to LinkedIn content has been blocked since the ban was introduced, the Russian government is attempting to eliminate any presence it has in the country, including its smartphone app. Apple has since confirmed that the company was first asked to remove the app over a month ago. Google has refused to confirm that it removed the app, but stated that it always complies with local laws. Increasing nation power Meanwhile, LinkedIn has expressed dismay at the decision, with a spokesperson saying that it “denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses”. The news follows less than a week after it was confirmed that the iOS app for The New York Times in China was removed by Apple’s App Store, following demands made by the Chinese government. The country has had a fraught relationship with the news organisation since its decision to publish a string of articles on the accumulated wealth of former prime minister, Wen Jiabao. Attempts to block particular content online has been an increasing tactic by governments across the globe in recent years – including Turkey – but these latest developments are the first signs that major tech companies are now actively cooperating to remove its own content by governmental request.

The update is focused on bringing a lot of critical bug fixes and improvements. The update brings added status bar icon options, improved shelf customisation, updated APN Settings for select carriers, fixed proximity sensor bug during calls, and increased system stability. Notably though, the OxygenOS 4.0.1 update has some known issues - such as a Google Play download issue, and provides some manual workaround measures to fix it. The OnePlus changelog states that not being able to download from Google Play is a known Google issue, and recommends not downloading through mobile data. OnePlus also redirects to these Google troubleshooting steps for resolving the problem if it persists. It also recommends turning on the Battery Saving Mode and resetting Google Play app preferences. Furthermore, the changelog notes another workaround that involves force stopping or uninstalling Truecaller, AVG Antivirus, and Paytm from your smartphone before performing a download from Google Play. The OxygenOS 4.0.1 update also fixes mobile data and Wi-Fi connectivity issues that some users were experiencing. However, the changelog notes that users who continue to experience issues can go to APN settings page and manually try all options available. The changelog also notes that Wi-Fi fluctuation issues may still exist. The Android 7.0 Nougat-based OxygenOS 4.0.1 update is being pushed out over-the-air and will reach all users over the coming days. The company is again calling it an "incremental rollout", implying that it will roll out in batches, and only a few users will receive it on the first day, while others should receive it over the course of the next few days. The company has released the entire changelog on its forum. We recommend you update your device with a strong Wi-Fi connection and good battery. Have you received the update yet?

News Sports Things to Do Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Waymo self-driving minivan will start test drives this month Sunday Jan 8, 2017 at 8:30 PM Waymo, Google's self-driving car division, will start testing its new fleet of minivans on public roads in California and Arizona later this month. The Associated Press Waymo, Google's self-driving car division, will start testing its new fleet of minivans on public roads in California and Arizona later this month. The minivans, built in collaboration with Fiat Chrysler, are Chrysler Pacifica hybrids outfitted with Waymo's own suite of sensors and radar. Waymo and FCA announced their partnership in May. In a speech at the Detroit auto show Sunday, CEO John Krafcik revealed that Waymo built the sensors, radar and software for the new minivans itself. Krafcik said the company felt the system would work better if it was developed specifically for self-driving instead of using off-the-shelf parts. "A single integrated system means that all the different parts of a self-driving car work together seamlessly," Krafcik said. Waymo also was able to significantly lower the cost of the system, Krafcik said. The rooftop lidar — which uses lasers to give the car a three-dimensional picture of the world — cost $75,000 a few years ago. Waymo has brought that cost down by 90 percent and has developed its own short-range and long-range lidar. Waymo's long-range lidar can see a football helmet two football fields away. Krafcik didn't say exactly how Waymo lowered the costs. But the announcement could concern suppliers like Velodyne, which makes lidar systems used by Ford Motor Co. and others, and Delphi Corp., which is developing its own autonomous driving system. Stephanie Brinley, an auto analyst for IHS Markit, said Google won't control the market for self-driving technology, so other suppliers with go ahead with development of their own systems. But some smaller players in the nascent industry are "going to fall away," she said. Waymo has repeatedly said that it doesn't plan to build its own cars, but provide self-driving systems to established carmakers, car-sharing services or others. In addition to FCA, Honda Motor Co. recently announced that it's in talks with Waymo about using its technology in Honda vehicles. Krafcik said Waymo, which has been developing self-driving cars for eight years, expects to reach 3 million miles of test-driving this May.

The space is currently ruled by Google Now and Siri. Alexa and Cortana aren’t far behind either. Joining the fray, possibly, is Nokia’s own assistant and this one’s called Viki. Google Assistant is an evolution of Google Now, but isn’t available on many devices yet. GSMInfo.nl spotted Viki in a trademark filing made by Nokia. The trademark application was for the name Viki, and describes a software for “the creation and monitoring of mobile and web assistants working with digital knowledge and combining all data sources into a single chat and voice-based interface.” Nokia, which recently revived its brand with the launch of the Android powered Nokia 6 in China, seems to have its heart in the right place. Samsung is also aware of the impending, AI-powered future and has been working on its own digital assistants for a while now (dubbed Bixby and Kestra). As far as we’re aware, Viki is still only a name on a trademark application and we don’t even know the work that has been done on this AI. There is also no timeline on if and when Viki will make its way to Nokia’s devices.

While at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, Asus unveiled the ZenFone AR, the second Tango-enabled phone to debut. What makes this interesting is that it also comes with Daydream, allowing it to deliver not only augmented reality but also virtual reality experiences. And, when compared to the chunky Lebovo Phab 2 Pro, the first Tango handset, the 5.7-inch ZenFone AR seems way more mobile. CES 2017: All the announcements that matter The phone weighs 170g, which is 18g less than the iPhone 7 Plus, and it features a sleek, LG G4-like pleather back. The camera system, which Asus called the TriCam, is positioned at the top so that your fingers won't get in the way of the motion-tracking sensor that has a fisheye lens. The phone's main sensor is a 23-megapixel camera with a 0.03 second autofocus. There's also a depth-sensing camera included. With this trio, the phone can do augmented reality, shoot in RAW, and save up to 92-megapixel high-resolution photos by combining four 23-megapixel ones. It also offers 4K video recording and comes with four-axis OIS. We couldn't fully test the phone's camera abilities nor see if it can shoot in a variety of situations, as the show floor itself was well lit. We also couldn't try out any AR, because the demo units ran an older version of Android that doesn't support Tango. But it did have Daydream enabled, so we watched a few videos in virtual reality. Pocket-lint First Impressions The phone has a Super AMOLED WQHD 2K display, which looked crisp and great, and thanks to the Snapdragon 821 processor and 8GB of RAM tucked inside, the YouTube VR app we tested ran fast and smoothly. ZenFone AR also has a 3,300mAh battery - decent, considering AR and VR are known to be battery hogs. It also has up to 256GB of built-in storage and a MicroSD slot for adding up to 2TB more. You also get USB-C charging, a standard headphone socket, a physical home button with an integrated fingerprint sensor. So, even without Tango and Daydream, the ZenFone AR is definitely a noteworthy flagship phone. It packs powerful tech, an excellent screen, and impressive cameras into a slim form factor - and we're looking forward to really giving it a whirl when it releases in the second quarter of 2017.

Business / 4 October 2016, 11:23am Julia Love File picture: Eric Gaillard/Reuters San Francisco - Alphabet’s Google is expected to unveil new smartphones at an event on Tuesday, the company's latest effort to sell consumers on a Google-branded device and to challenge Apple at the high end of the market. Analysts predict the San Francisco product launch will also showcase other Google hardware initiatives, including a voice-controlled speaker system called Home to challenge Amazon.com’s Echo device, and a virtual reality headset. The most eagerly expected offering is a pair of smartphones released under the Pixel brand, replacing the Nexus line. While most vendors other than Apple use Google's Android operating system, the company has for years toyed with various approaches to building its own hardware without alienating manufacturers. Google has sold Nexus phones since 2010, but the devices have gained little traction in a market dominated by Samsung Electronics. Analysts attribute the lacklustre sales to poor distribution, as the phones typically are not available through network carriers, the channel most US consumers rely on. Google also owned the Motorola smartphone business briefly before selling it to Lenovo Group. Because its mobile software is available so widely, Google has struggled to distinguish its own devices, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Google “wants to have this end-to-end experience, but it's not clear that people really want that”, Dawson said. The new Pixel phones are expected to cost more than $600, putting them at the high end of the market, where Apple is the leading player. Dawson is more optimistic about the Home device - unveiled at the company's developer conference this year - which works with home entertainment systems and responds to voice commands. The device represents an important move in an intensifying battle between Google and other tech giants to establish the dominant “digital assistant”. Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are vying for supremacy as more people search the web and make purchases online through voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling some digital devices. Although Amazon was first to market, Google can capture plenty of sales in the nascent category, Dawson said. But as with smartphones, distribution may pose a challenge. “Amazon has the advantage of being able to put this on the home page of the biggest e-commerce site in the world,” he said. Analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies said he also expects Google to discuss its virtual reality headset, Daydream, at the event. He said the company may also reveal plans to combine its Chrome operating system for laptops and its Android mobile software, helping developers build for more devices.

Well technically, most of us have Cortana now, thanks to Microsoft Windows 10, but it’s nowhere near as advanced as that in Halo. I am talking about voice-activated assistants, otherwise known as virtual assistants. Technology has developed tremendously over the years and now we have virtual assistants in the palm of our hands. IT STARTED WITH SIRI Virtual assistants is a software that enables you to interact with your device, with the long-term goal of making it easier for you, compared to interacting with it in a conventional way. Another way of imagining it is that you, the user, are the captain of the device and you give out orders. The first virtual assistant that†garnered mainstream attention was Apple’s Siri, which was introduced in its iPhone 4S on Oct 4, 2011. It was initially created by Siri Inc. for a number of mobile platforms but it was bought over by Apple and thus became an iPhone-exclusive. People became fascinated by the artificial intelligence-based assistant software, especially with its potential in evolving the way we interact with the iPhone. Not only were people interested in a hands-free experience, they found joy in asking Siri a number of strange questions like “are you single?” and “what’s the best smartphone in the world?”. By collecting data from all these questions, Apple made Siri smarter and capable of answering more questions as well as doing more things. Siri has since become an integral part of the iOS experience. It is now part of Apple’s iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and more. This also led to competitors coming up with their own unique spin on virtual assistants. CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS Amazon is building a “Skills Kit” for its virtual assistant Alexa. It allows the developers to create their own voice commands, which allow them to create any kind of interaction possible with their software by just using voices. This includes smart home controls and a to-do list. Amazon is boasting about its high number of third party Alexa skills, but to ensure that there will be no clash in the given commands, the skills need specific syntax to activate such as “Alexa, ask Lazada to track my order”. Apple, on the other hand, has a very strict control limits when it comes to using Siri. It only has a few uses, including calls, messaging, payments, photo search, workouts and ride booking. Even then, it controls the flow of conversation, so the apps can only provide data and some visuals, at most. The upside of doing this is that it reduces the chance of Siri making mistakes. Google meanwhile is doing a similar gatekeeper-type role by utilising keywords to activate specific third party services. Once an approved keyword is detected by the virtual assistant, the developer takes over the interaction using artificial intelligence tools to follow up with the conversation. It is not as strict as Apple but in doing this, it hopes to make the experience as accurate as possible. GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE To encourage more people to adopt Alexa, Amazon and Conexant have begun to offer hardware developer kits that allow hardware makers to start working on hands-free voice controls for their upcoming products in a simpler fashion. Whether it’s a car’s multimedia system, videogame consoles or even home security, it opens up a new realm of possibilities with Amazon’s Alexa for years to come. Google, on the other hand, is going one step further with its Android Things initiative. It is part software tools and part ready-made development hardware with all the basic components and necessary FCC certifications. It’s essentially the same as Amazon’s initiative, except that you get both software and hardware to work with. If you integrate this with your next killer product, you’re already taking another big step forward as you’ll be tied with Google’s Weave platform and thus, have Google’s virtual assistant inside your product. Given how reliable and well-known the Google name is today, this will spell the beginning of more intelligent products with the Google flavour mixed in it. Microsoft’s plans are a bit hazy. They want more people to adopt Cortana into their products even though the Cortana Devices software development kit is not publicly available yet. They have struck a deal with Harman Kardon as an early partner for a Cortana-enabled speaker set but that’s pretty much all we know. At the moment, it seems like Microsoft will be lagging behind its competitors in the race to be crowned the king of virtual assistants. We all know of Apple’s track record of keeping within the family. If they are to go the hardware route, it will either be Apple’s own products or brands within the Apple umbrella like Beats. The company is allegedly integrating artificial intelligence, most likely Siri, into an upcoming Apple AirPods to make it function similarly to Google Glasses. According iTech Post’s Victor Thomson, “Apple is having an original approach, placing a bet on a nonvisual connection. This may be a winning strategy, at least until the optical wearable technology matures.” Now that Siri is becoming capable of doing what we ask as opposed to just answering questions, Thomson also noted that experts are anticipating personalities being injected into artificial intelligence systems. Imagine Siri having interchangeable personalities with each one being capable of interacting differently with users. It could be the answer to globalising the technology. As these virtual assistants evolve, we will start to see that they serve as the basis of future applications as well as existing technologies. Businesses will soon start to fully utilise chatbox applications, as opposed to having a customer service representative when dealing with customer. We will soon be able to control everything in our house with just our smartphones. We may also actually start to see self-driving cars become a reality. This could also spell the beginning of an virtual assisted “Uber” of the future. At present, voice-activated assistants may just be a smartphone software but it does appear that it will be moving to new avenues in the coming years. In fact, there may be a chance that if technology continues to evolve at the pace it’s going right now, we can be doing anything and everything with just our voices. It seems like a futuristic technology ripped straight from Disney’s Wall-E, but the stage is already set for us to experience such a future. WHAT TO EXPECT FROM VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS IN SMARTPHONES FOR 2017? * Virtual assistants having their own unique, and possibly interchangeable, personalities that will make them more akin to real human assistants. * Samsung Galaxy S8 is said to have a brand new artificial intelligence-based virtual assistant called Bixby. It will be usable with all of the phone’s native apps and can be asked to do tasks such as displaying media that satisfies particular criteria given by users. * Huawei to integrate Amazon’s Alexa into its smartphone line-up, beginning with the Huawei Mate 9 early this year. This will put Alexa in direct competition with Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant and the aforementioned Bixby. * According to Bloomberg, Qualcomm will be releasing its Snapdragon 835 chipset for smartphones. One of the chip’s highlights is that it makes it easier for smartphones to handle artificial intelligence-type work such as running virtual assistants which gives more room in evolving the technology in smartphones. * Virtual assistants are expected to expand their capabilities further by extending their services to third party applications. Users will eventually be able to order virtual assistants to do tasks that involve any and every application available. 115 reads Virtual assistants could one day become a component in self-driving cars. We will soon be able to control everything in our house with just smartphones.

By Alistair Barr. Added by Agency Staff on 9 January 2017. Saved under Top, World Tweet The Pebble E-Paper Watch CES debuted gadget hits like the VCR, CD player and Xbox over the years, but the popular consumer electronics conference also showcases a lot of technology that fails to match the hype. Some of the top flops from 50 years of the Las Vegas show include digital audio tape players, Apple’s Newton handheld computer and Atari’s Jaguar gaming console. Here are some of the more recent disappointments from CES. Smart glasses Google kicked off a wave of optimism about Internet-connected eyewear when it unveiled Google Glass at its developer conference in April 2013. At CES in early 2014, there were a bunch on show, including the Epson Moverio BT-200 and Vergence Labs’ Epiphany glasses which let the wearer control drones with hand gestures. As of early 2017, there were no mainstream smart glasses selling in high volumes. Google Glass flopped. Apple is working on the technology, but hasn’t released a product yet. 3D printers This was the anointed technology at CES 2013. The CubeX from 3D Systems won a Best of CES for emerging technology that year. 3D printers have made steady progress since then, especially for industrial uses, but they aren’t in a lot of homes or offices. MakerBot, a pioneer in the sector that had a strong presence in 2013, has cut staff amid declining sales. Stratasys bought MakerBot in 2013, and its share price hit a record in January 2014. The stock is down more than 75% since then. 3D Systems shares are down about the same amount in that period. Lily, GoPro drones Start-up Lily Robotics won a coveted CES 2016 innovation award for its autonomously steered camera drone. A working version of the gadget wasn’t shown at the conference and shipping dates have been delayed. GoPro founder Nick Woodman took to the stage at the same CES to tease more information about his company’s Karma drone. That gadget finally went on sale in October, but the company recalled thousands of them after they lost power. GoPro was back at CES this year showing off the Karma and the company said it will relaunch the drone later in 2017. Hoverboards At CES 2016, makers of hoverboards battled over which company came up with the technology and related designs. The electric skateboards were gaining in popularity, thanks in part to celebrities like Justin Bieber posting shots of themselves zipping around on the devices. So, there was a lot at stake. But things turned sour when US federal marshals raided the CES booth of a Chinese hoverboard maker. Future Motion, a Silicon Valley start-up, said it invented and patented a self-balancing electric skateboard that looked strikingly similar to the ones the marshals confiscated. Less than two months later, Amazon.com and other big retailers stopped selling hoverboards after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission deemed them unsafe, saying they “pose an unreasonable risk of fire” if they didn’t meet voluntary safety standards. No hoverboards on the market met those standards, it added at the time. Google Glass Pebble Pebble Technology was the belle of the CES 2013 ball when the start-up announced its smartwatch would ship in late January. The following year, its Pebble Steel model made several Best of CES lists including The Verge’s Best Smartwatch. Alas, the company is no more. Struggling under the weight of its debt, the company sold software assets to Fitbit last month. Pebble hardware projects are no more and it isn’t actively supporting existing watches. Too bad for buyers wowed by their showing at CES. Smartwatches At CES 2014, a year after Pebble’s debut, dozens of smartwatches were shown. Google unveiled its Android Wear smartwatch platform a few months later, and Apple announced its Watch in September of that year. The hope was that smartwatches would be the next hot gadget to rival the smartphone. But by the third quarter of 2016, global smartwatch sales were down 52% from a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. The Dell Venue 8 7000 Tablet Calling it the thinnest tablet in the world, CES listed Dell’s Venue 8 device among its 2015 Best of Innovation Award Honorees. It was part of an attempt by Intel to get its components into more tablets and other mobile devices. The tablet featured an Intel RealSense camera and Atom processor. However, last year Dell stopped selling the tablets. Intel managed to sneak a chip into some of the latest iPhones, but the semiconductor giant still hasn’t cracked mobile.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Joe Black Yeah well beyond a certain price/utility threshold products just cannot go mainstream. Its cool as proof of concept I suppose. Skerminkel The main issue with “hoverboards” obviously was that they did not hover! It’s like Toyota calling a new Corolla a plane.

The announcement came from John Krafcik, head of Google’s Waymo unit, whose search for partners to develop and install the company’s autonomous driving technology into real cars has so far yielded only an alliance with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and a pending deal with Honda Motor Co. Google pushes virtual reality harder with new phones from partners Headlining a future mobility conference during the show’s media preview, Krafcik said Waymo’s latest set of self-driving hardware and software incorporated a new array of sensors, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar, all developed and built in-house. Krafcik said Waymo had reduced the cost of a single lidar unit by 90 percent, to about $7,500. Among major outside suppliers of this technology, Velodyne Lidar Inc and Quanergy Systems Inc both have said they are developing smaller solid-state lidar units that eventually would cost $200 or less. Waymo’s existing test fleet of self-driving cars, including some specially equipped Lexus RX450s and Google’s own “Firefly” prototypes, has accumulated nearly 2.5 million miles in less than eight years, mostly on city streets. Krafcik said Waymo planned to test the first self-driving Pacificas this month on public roads in California and Arizona. He did not say when the system would be ready to install in production vehicles.

Since the smartphone has already been upgraded to the Android 7.0 Nougat software, the new update is based on the latest version of Google's mobile OS. On the OnePlus forums page, OxygenOS staff member Tony L. announced on Saturday that an OTA update has arrived for the OnePlus 3. He also revealed that the rollout of OxygenOS 4.0.1 is going to be incremental, but he didn’t reveal the reason why this is so. Tony simply noted that only a small percentage of OnePlus 3 owners are getting update notifications this weekend and a broader release of the update is expected to happen in a few days. For the Android Nougat changes, users can expect to see new notifications design and a new Settings menu design. Multi-window view has also been added to the flagship handset, along with the notification direct reply feature and the custom DPI support. The status bar has been upgraded with more icon options as well. The staff member did not forget to mention the improved shelf customization, increased system stability and updated APN settings. Aside from bringing something new to the table, OxygenOS 4.0.1 also addresses a couple of known issues in the software of the device. For example, the bug that’s causing proximity sensor errors during calls has been quashed, as per PhoneArena. The problem with apps not downloading properly from the Play Store has also been singled out in Tony’s update. When apps do not download from Google’s Play Store, the OnePlus dev suggests users should check Google’s troubleshooting steps or try switching on the Battery Saving Mode as well as resetting the Play Store app preferences. For users who are complaining about downloading issues while connected to Data Roaming access, Tony said this is a known Google issue. For other cases like fluctuating WiFi connection and mobile data problems, Tony stated in his post that owners should directly send him a private message for faster and more reliable feedback. For APN-related mobile data issues, the OxygenOS developer wrote that users should alter the APN settings and try all the options there as much as possible.

IBM reported the flaw (CVE-2016-8467) which allows infected computers and malicious power chargers to compromise Nexus 6 and 6p phones. Google badged the bug high severity and prevented locked bootloaders from booting into the necessary risky boot modes. Nexus 6 devices were patched in November while 6P devices received the update this month. The vulnerability overcomes the normal requirement that phones already have adb enabled in developer options. However, users in physical control of handsets will need to tap a prompt to authorise adb connectivity with the infected PC or charger for the attacks to work. That is a function familar with those used to modifying their devices to install custom ROMs, something even security-minded individuals practice, and less so to users running stock phones. Stolen phone call audio from an infected device. Image: IBM. Once ADB is established, the malicious PC or charger can reboot Nexus devices into the bootloader from where malware can be installed. On 6 devices, attackers can eavesdrop on communications including phone calls and SMS, while modem restrictions on the still current 6p model restrict attackers to stealing text messages. "Furthermore, this level of access to the Nexus 6 modem allows attackers to find the exact GPS coordinates with detailed satellite information, place phone calls, steal call information and access or change nonvolatile items or the EFS partition," says Roee Hay and Michael Goberman of IBM's X-Force application security research team. Five commands are used to enable the required USB options for attackers to have persistence on the devices which allows further now silent attacks to be made over a USB connection. Attackers with a victim device in their hand can boot Nexus devices into fastboot and choose BP-Tools or Factory. Another uninitialised kernel memory leakage bug (CVE-2016-6678) in Nexus 6 permits the theft of some network traffic. "We also discovered a vulnerability in the f_usbnet driver itself in which four to five bytes of uninitialised kernel data are padded to every ethernet frame carried over USB," Hay and Goberman say. "This leak may contain sensitive data that could empower cybercriminals to exploit the system." ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 27 Comments More from The Register Google pays $100k to anti-malware crusader Giovanni Vigna Prolific malware murderer bags Mountain View's Security, Privacy and Anti-Abuse award Google's Chrome cloaks Pirate Bay in red screen of malware death Scam ads abound 29 Comments Google password fill effort could kill Android malware's best tricks Small boost to login speed could be a big roadblock for Marshmallow malware 11 Comments Apple fans using Chrome on alert for Mac malware Google AdWords has been spewing software nasties 29 Comments Android-rooting Gooligan malware infects 1 million devices At an estimated rate of 13,000 smartphones a day 22 Comments Security firm clarifies power-station 'SCADA' malware claim It's not the next Stuxnet, says SentinelOne, it's just very naughty code 4 Comments Whitepapers Hunting insider threats Insider threats are a real risk to business because they threaten both customer and employee trust. 5 Steps to Good Governance Why it should be done efficiently and seamlessly, so that employees can focus on more exciting goals—innovative, business-growing goals 4 ways to build better apps with secure content services Four powerful digital content services that can help your company transform the way people interact with your content from within your web and mobile apps.

By: Tech Desk | Published:January 9, 2017 10:37 am A Chrysler Pacifica hybrid outfitted with Waymo’s suite of sensors and radar is shown at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Sunday, Jan. 8, 2017. Waymo is the autonomous vehicle company created by Google’s parent company, Alphabet. (Source: AP ) Waymo, Google’s self-driving car division, will start testing its new fleet of minivans on public roads in California and Arizona later this month. The minivans, built in collaboration with Fiat Chrysler, are Chrysler Pacifica hybrids outfitted with Waymo’s own suite of sensors and radar. Waymo and FCA announced their partnership in May. In a speech at the Detroit auto show Sunday, CEO John Krafcik revealed that Waymo built the sensors, radar and software for the new minivans itself. Krafcik said the company felt the system would work better if it was developed specifically for self-driving instead of using off-the-shelf parts. “A single integrated system means that all the different parts of a self-driving car work together seamlessly,” Krafcik said. Waymo also was able to significantly lower the cost of the system, Krafcik said. The rooftop lidar — which uses lasers to give the car a three-dimensional picture of the world — cost $75,000 a few years ago. Waymo has brought that cost down by 90 percent and has developed its own short-range and long-range lidar. Waymo’s long-range lidar can see a football helmet two football fields away. Krafcik didn’t say exactly how Waymo lowered the costs. But the announcement could concern suppliers like Velodyne, which makes lidar systems used by Ford Motor Co. and others, and Delphi Corp., which is developing its own autonomous driving system. Read more: Meet Waymo, the new name for Google’s first self-driving car project Stephanie Brinley, an auto analyst for IHS Markit, said Google won’t control the market for self-driving technology, so other suppliers with go ahead with development of their own systems. But some smaller players in the nascent industry are “going to fall away,” she said. Waymo has repeatedly said that it doesn’t plan to build its own cars, but provide self-driving systems to established carmakers, car-sharing services or others. In addition to FCA, Honda Motor Co. recently announced that it’s in talks with Waymo about using its technology in Honda vehicles. Krafcik said Waymo, which has been developing self-driving cars for eight years, expects to reach 3 million miles of test-driving this May. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Google Best of Express Meghalaya sex scam: Guest-house owned by Home Minister’s family under probe EntertainmentOk Jaanu box office collection day 3: Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor film struggles to hold ground EntertainmentxXx Return of Xander Cage box office collection day 2: Deepika Padukone-Vin Diesel film expected to earn well EntertainmentSalman Khan shares nostalgic picture from sets of Karan Arjun, wishes SRK-Hrithik for Raees-Kaabil EntertainmentKoffee With Karan: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor turn Karan Johar's show into a mini kitty party Must Read SportsKohli, Kedar hit magical tons to script sensational win SportsThis win is going to take a while to sink in, says Kohli SportsVirat Kohli leaves Twitterati awe-struck after century TechnologyNokia could be developing a foldable smartphone, hints patent TechnologyLenovo sends out press invite for MWC 2017, may debut Moto G5 Plus TechnologyFormer Android chief Andy Rubin to release a high-end, AI-focused smartphone  Sonam Kapoor, Frieda Pinto, Pooja Hegde: Best and worst dressed Bollywood divas at Filmfare Awards 2017 Jan 16: Latest News Centre issues draft requirements under digital village initiative Startup India: 2016 not a good year as new startups decline by 67% China finally agrees to import buffalo meat from India Kathputli Colony: Life at the transit camp C N Rao at Jamia Hamdard Convocation: ‘To excel in science, we need hard work, funds for varsities’                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Helping them out in this endeavour, would Chrysler, with its Pacifica minivans, a fleet of which will be deployed out to the open public roads for testing by the end of January. The news comes from day one of the North American International Auto Show which kicked off on 8 January and this is indeed the first time we see Google’s Waymo chops put to practice using production ready cars as an add on kit. The move comes after Google officially cut a deal with Chrysler back in May 2016. Seven months later, this is Google’s first working model fitted with all of its sensors ready to hit the streets. The objective for now as specified by Waymo CEO John Krafcik, was to “learn how people of all ages, shapes, and group sizes experience our fully self-driving technology.” The car which is originally just the standard e-hybrid version of the Pacifica minivan now comes fitted with an array of sensors that lets it see the world around it no matter what the weather conditions. This would include the radar, sensors, LiDAR and plenty of cameras along with the Waymo’s software bits that now been integrated on the new Pacifica. The important bit according to a report by The Verge is that Google also said that it would be building these components themselves to bring down their prices. It also pointed out that at some point both Chrysler and Google may launch a ride-sharing service with autonomous vehicles similar to what Uber is trying to pull off with Volvo. This is indeed the first of many vehicles to come in what seems to be an Android approach to autonomous cars. While Google can build software and bring down the cost of the components needed for the kit, it lacks the experience when it comes to building cars, which is where the plethora of automakers come into the picture. With that it mind it was only recently that Google built its own smartphone with the Pixel. So it won’t be too long until Google will want to take control over both hardware and software to deliver a class-leading product in the automotive space. Google had recently announced that it was looking to partner with Japanese automaker Honda so the Chrysler Pacifica is indeed the first of many self-driving vehicles to come from Waymo. Automaker Tesla Motors oddly skipped on the LiDAR component altogether thanks to its expensive price tag and found a workaround with software and cameras instead. While LiDAR is primary component for a self-driving car, giving it a 360 view of its surroundings, it still an expensive piece of equipment which was earlier priced as much as the Pacifica minivan itself. Thanks to innovation and the push for self-driving vehicles, the price tags for the same are dropping as much as by 90 percent.

Most importantly it’s the only way I can use Microsoft Office without having to pay Bill every other month. In the old days, all I had to do was buy a new laptop flip the lid, remove crapware that comes preloaded, install an antivirus and then I was good to go. Now things are decidedly different. I had to struggle to gain limited control on how I received my updates. Removing some of the useless applications like MSN Sports and other useless bandwidth hogging parts was unnecessarily hard. Office, it seems, is no longer preactivated To top all that off it seems the preinstalled version of Office that came with the laptop was not even activated! And that is where the trouble began. A tale of confusing licences Since I have sworn off pirated software I decided to find out how much it would cost me to get a licence. The array of licences available is mind-numbing and confusing. There are SPLA, FFP, OEM (I knew was not looking for this right away), USL and of course Volume Licensing where I have to pay Bill every month/year. advertisement After deciding I didn’t really want to spend an eye-popping $290 – families live off that kind of money- to buy glorified text editor I decided to have a look at volume licensing which looked cheaper. Only to be confronted by another endless iteration of options and tables. Later I discovered I had to pay $99 a year for the trouble of having One Note on my desktop. Then it got me thinking. Do I really need Office anymore? Do you really need Office? Like I said above there was a time when Ms Office was the mainstay of every office big and small. Google Docs was not even considered an alternative, it was clunky, lacked essential features, terrorised Internet Explorer and stretched it to its limits, required a very good internet connection and produced documents that were not exactly compatible. That was then. Now, Google Docs is a rival that Ms Office products have to contend with. While for nostalgic reasons people still tend to stick to Ms Office I don’t think the experience is worth the $99 a year experience. Add the fact that sometimes I just want to work from any device without being shackled by the fact that the demi-gods at Microsoft could not be bothered to port Office to it, Google Docs became a viable alternative. The last straw was when the Office Update Utility started chewing through my limited bandwidth in the middle of the day rendering my connection unusable. So I said no to Microsoft and decided to avail to Google one more facet of my life. Now the damn thing knows where I stay, the weather, what I look like, where I have been and just about everything else. Creepily it tells me when it’s time to go to work and alerts me when my secret football team is taking a thrashing. Getting some new love Prior to this change, I had only used Google Docs occasionally. While it takes time to get used to the interface the experience is not unpleasant. One feature that takes some getting used to is the autosave feature. You type something and it is saved almost instantly without hitting Ctrl + S. If you feign a British or American accent then there is voice typing to give your fingers a rest but it seems for all its omniscience Google still struggles to spell Tapiwa. You also get access to common fonts such as Calibri plus the shipload of Google’s famous web safe fonts. A word of warning using these fonts would require the person to whom you are sending the document to, to download the fonts if they are using an offline document viewer such as Ms Office 2013 to view the document properly. The interface is uncluttered and distraction free allowing your to focus on the task at hand. You can also Google search to include links or find the meanings of various words, use a thesaurus and most importantly share and collaborate with others with ease. I am sure Ms Office’s cloud offerings have features to match these and to be fair but Google Docs comes with free 15 GB storage and if I want a paid version I have to pay $5 a month without going through a licensing ballet. I don’t even have to think about back-ups anymore. You can also extend Google Docs using many of the offered add-ons. For the first time, I can spell the word café the way it’s supposed to be spelt without going through hoops. Don’t believe me? Try spelling MØ in Word. The internet catch One serious drawback of using Google Drive is that you need a constant and decent internet connection otherwise you will go bald as you constantly pull out your hair in frustration. Sure you can edit a document offline for a while but the suit is supposed to be used online. A counter-argument can be made that Ms Office requires regular large updates to be downloaded and applied which means an internet connection would still be required but it will not stop working even if you don’t update it so. Also while their version of Excel (it’s really called a spreadsheet) is decent when it comes to advanced features it’s just crap. It cannot even properly import CVS files generated by Google themselves which is pretty embarrassing. You could also check LibreOffice LibreOffice is touted as a FOSS Ms Office alternative. Personally, I don’t believe that at all. I personally detest it myself but some people swear by it. So if you do not have a constant internet connection you can try that route. Stay away from OpenOffice while you are at it. It receives less frequent updates and I can predict its ultimate demise in the next coming months or years. Last words To be clear I did not uninstall Office because it was terrible, it just that for me, and I would guess for most people, there is really no compelling reason to choose it above its competitors anymore. That, plus Google Docs is pretty awesome you should give it a try. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Google, Microsoft Office, office 365 Previous Post « Some light at the end of the tunnel for local gamers.

Notepad++ and you’re in heaven. This ‘Everybody Hates Microsoft’ mantra is getting old. We all know the alternatives are all trying to replicate Windows and MS Office with laughable results. We use Google for Business in our company for email and storage requirements, and we get all sorts of issues with missing files, failed syncs, you-name-it. We miss the features of Outlook and Google deliberately killed compatibility with Outlook for their enterprise email service. The truth of the matter is the world runs on Windows and Microsoft deserves some credit for that Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 11:23 AM Read again slowly this time. My uninstalling Office has nothing to do with hating Microsoft. I run bash in Windows! I and a lot of ppl cannot afford it Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:01 PM PS: Volume Licensing From my experience with Volume Licensing, its is just a term most usually for organisations whereby an organisation requires multiple licenses of the Microsoft product eg the MS Office, but they do not require multiple copies of the installation media. It is cheap in the sense that you get only 1 DVD but your license can have the number of activations or seats that you require e.g for 50 users. That is how the cheapness comes about in that they do not need to ship to you 50 DVDs. What you are actually referring to as having to pay a bill every month if I am not mistaken is Office365. Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:05 PM For MS Office Licenses, the licenses are perpertual and what you expires every 24 months is the Software Assurance which gives you the ability to upgrade to a new version if Microsoft brings in a new version of the software and your Software Assurance is still valid. Yes Microsoft licensing is confusing Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 12:38 PM Thanks Tsenny and EMC. Sometimes I feel the articles on TECHZim, while aimed at addressing some tech issue, lack sufficient investigation that would make them more informative. They end up sounding like posts on a personal blog where there is no editorial moderation. And for some of us, being non-core techies, we will be hoping to read insightful articles on tech as it affects us, how we can make it easier to use, general news, etc. Like how Tsenny just described MS Office licensing in 2 short paragraphs, leaving me with sufficient detail that at least the amount I spend will be once off, but the licensing is confusing. And to the writer, from a PR point of view, “never tell a person who has taken the time to read your writing that they should “read again more slowly this time”. It’s rude. I am saying this from the point of view of both a writer, reader and consumer. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:10 PM Sigh, I apologize for being insensitive, too much time at Stack Exchange and hacker forums where you speak your mind next time I will buy a candle and we will hug it out. I am not speaking for the editor but when I write, and for most tech blogs like ZDNet, Techcrunch, Wired and a gazillion others out there, each writer has his/her little nook and cranny. We know for example that Ernesto from torrentfreak hates the DCMA, Joey from OMGUbuntu loves his cat etc it’s just how it is. I cannot, and will never write about something that I don’t know. I will never even pretend to be unbiased, that is a Western media fiction just compare Fox News and ABC for example and you will know there is never such a thing as a balanced opinion. The point of the article was Ms Office licensing is expensive and stupid compared to how they used to do it. The caustic remark was meant to point out the fact that I was talking about Word Processing and the comment is telling me to use Notepad ! and Notepad++. For the record I use Sublime Text and Atom whenever I need a text editor. Now I will admit I have done it myself countless times: I see the title and scroll down to the comment section to leave a comment without even reading the article. Reply surur says: January 6, 2017 at 7:16 PM The licensing is only confusing because Garikai was looking for a work around to paying full price. For consumers there are really only two options – 1) pay full price for the boxed copy or 2) pay for Office 365 Home. All the other licensing models are for schools and businesses or PC builders, and are not intended for regular consumers. This is the same ridiculous complaint we see about there being 11 versions of Windows . Windows Server is not for granny at home. She either gets Windows with her PC, buys a boxed copy in the store (where there will only be Pro and Home) or purchase an upgrade from the online store, where there will only be Pro and Home. Reply TheKing says: January 6, 2017 at 12:50 PM WPS is the best Microsoft Office alternative for Linux. WPS Writer matches or is actually better than Word. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM No argument here. It’s just I cannot afford it anymore. Reply Lennon says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM I am selling Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus activation key only for $35. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 2:26 PM I have read this and as someone who buys MS Office (Full Pro) almost every month, l can say this is not clearly explained, its a mixed bag of ideas. We need to clearly distinguish which office we are talking about! Is it online office or offline office. Its a rule, if you are using SaaS, the features are limited compared to offline. One such SaaS is MS Office 365. Licensing can be cheap because you can rent it when you need it, and stop when you do not want it. I have both Libre Office and MS Pro on my PC, l still believe Libre is the easier no brainer replacement for MS offline installations. Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 3:38 PM Exactly my point.. the original article is going everywhere else except somewhere specific. Have found more insight from the comments section than the original article. That being said, being a technocrat in an area and supping with the Techcrunch, Google or any of those big guys does not make one a good article writer. One should invest time in learning how to write effectively. Reply NdiniNdadaro says: January 6, 2017 at 2:55 PM I use cracked version much like Rhodes took the land without paying. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 3:30 PM cracked version on works for offline usage, the day it will call home is the day you will kiss it goodbye Reply Tom says: January 7, 2017 at 2:29 AM TechZim, your articles are becoming poorer and poorer by the day. Everytime i read ur articles since u decided to diversify from being a tech only site i am disappointed. Guys u r putting too much off ur emotions and little research in the topic at hand. Your articles are now more of click bait than informative. What have i learned from your article? i hv learned that u dont like that Microsoft dorminates the word editor space. while its ur opinion u didnt fully research on how to get a licence to use Office and which type of user each license suits , u just complained how u dont want to pay money to use Office. this article is good for a teenage blog not a site which aims to inform people. In a nutshell, too much self opinion less facts (this has bn happening for some time ) Reply peterc says: January 7, 2017 at 9:37 AM LibreOffice user here. Not the best thing since sliced bread but it solves most of my problems. Reply Joe says: January 8, 2017 at 10:17 AM I’ve been using Google docs extensively over the last few years. But here is one simple example of many as to why you should not get rid of word and rely solely on Google docs. Write a simple 5 page document in Google docs. Now go to page 3 of the document and start page numbering on that page instead. You won’t be able to. Google states it. There are several simple things like that are missing in docs that is infuriating. I always end up going back to word.

Apple and Google forced to take down LinkedIn from app stores after country blocks the app - Irish Sun Issue 016/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Apple and Google forced to take down LinkedIn from app stores after country blocks the app Irish Sun Sunday 8th January, 2017 • Apple and Google are in a difficult position after Russian demanded removal of LinkedIn • Russia wants to completely cut off access to LinkedIn’s content from within the country • Russian court claimed LinkedIn violated the country’s data laws MOSCOW, Russia - Weeks after a Russian court banned the professional social networking website, LinkedIn from operating in the country - now Russia has demanded that Apple and Google remove the app from the Russian versions of the App Store and the Google Play Store. The communications regulator of Russia, Roskomnadzor had announced that LinkedIn would no longer be available to the Russians after the court noted that Microsoft owned LinkedIn was violating the country’s data laws.  The issue was brought to light when the U.S.-based company defied the newly drafted laws of the Russian legislature.  According to the new set of laws drafted by the country’s legislators in September 2015, named Federal Law 526-FZ, LinkedIn had been violating the two major rules, which is storing personal data within the countries premises and processing information of third parties that are not registered on the website.  The data localisation law introduced several changes, thus affecting several social media sites.  The rules were earlier framed in order to protect users from hackers, however, they are also used against international companies to get them to hand over information about their users, the most companies claim is against their policies. LinkedIn, that has more than 6 million users in the country, had earlier claimed that the decision would hurt several of its users in the country and would cause dismay for those who benefit from the services.  A spokesperson for Roskomnadzor said that LinkedIn did not respond to requests for the relocation of the professional social network's servers to Russia. This led to the ban place on LinkedIn and internet service providers in the country eventually blocked public access to LinkedIn. Russia’s move to force Apple and Google to remove the banned business networking site from their app stores is similar to China’s recent request made to Apple, to ban apps related to or run by The New York Times.  The situation in both Russia and China, however, jeopardises the core value of Apple and Google, of pushing free speech and promoting an open internet.  However, reports pointed out that there were other methods people in the country would still be able to download the app, considering technologies like VPNs are available in Russia.  Share this article: Back to Irish Sun Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

She ultimately ended up calling the office of the deputy inspector general of police. The officer heard her out and convinced her to go in for counselling instead. BAREILLY: A 24-year-old girl, whose boyfriend had left her under family pressure, decided to end her life by jumping into the Yamuna Canal 4 km from Saharanpur. At the water's edge, however, she began having second thoughts and wanted to see if there was an easier way to commit suicide. Like anyone with a question, she turned to Google. The search results, including that of suicide helpline numbers, led to her considering other options. She ultimately ended up calling the office of the deputy inspector general of police. The officer heard her out and convinced her to go in for counselling instead. Google does not immediately show options when someone types "how to commit suicide". Instead, it throws up a host of sites and numbers to contact, including helplines such as that run by Aasra, a crisis prevention centre. "On January 3, I got a call from the girl on my public number. She was quite nervous and was about to end her life. She told me she had even searched how to kill herself on Google. Among the search results, she told me, she found my number. I heard her out and told her to come to my office so we could talk about it in detail," said DIG Jitendra Kumar Shahi, talking to TOI. The girl turned up at his office in a while and narrated her story. She had been in a relationship with a boy for several years, but after the boy got a government job recently, he allegedly changed his mind about marrying her under pressure from his family. "We come across such cases every day. Sometimes girls level harassment or assault charges after a relationship ends. This girl was just deeply traumatized and wanted help. She made no allegations against her boyfriend and in fact spoke warmly of him. I asked the station officer of the women's police station to counsel the couple and look into the matter," the DIG added. The SO of women's police station, Prabha Singh, told TOI that two rounds of counselling had been done so far. "On the day the girl met the DIG, he sent her to me and I advised her to become stronger and that there was no need to be afraid of anybody. Today, we summoned the boy and also had a counselling session with him, in the presence of the girl and advised the couple about the options they had to live better lives and have a good future." The girl was not available for comment in the matter. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

The announcement was made during a presentation on the eve of the Detroit motor show by John Krafcik, CEO of Google’s self-driving car team and the former head of Hyundai North America, during which he highlighted the firm’s existing deals with the Fiat Chrysler Group and Honda to work on future projects. Google's Waymo self-driving company announced Outlining some of the motivations for developing the technology, and the landmark achievements of the eight-year-old project so far, Krafcik reiterated that Waymo was only interested in developing so-called Level 4 autonomy - essentially fully autonomous cars that can operate without a driver or steering wheel and pedals. “Each year more than 1.2m people die on roads - that’s the equivalent of a Boeing 737 falling from the sky every hour of every day all year long," said Krafcik, highlighting what he perceived as the shortcomings of current cars and the issues Waymo is looking to solve. “Then there are the people who can’t drive - 20m in the USA alone. Plus, we spend an average of 50 minutes a day commuting - that’s the equivalent of 162 lifetimes wasted per day. Then there’s the fact an average car sits idle 94% of the time.” Last year, in Austin, Texas, a Google car undertook what Krafcik claimed was the world’s first truly driverless journey, in one of the Google self-driving prototypes - nicknamed Firefly - with no steering wheel and no driver. However, he said Waymo’s co-operation with the FCA Group - and specifically in developing and building 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid models in just under six months ready for road testing later in January 2017 - would create a watershed moment in development. “Where Firefly was limited to 25mph, these vehicles can be tested on all roads and in more road conditions,” said Krafcik.  Is the Google car in trouble? Highlighting some of the technological advances Waymo has made as it has developed its own software and hardware, rather than relying on bought-in technology, Krafcik pointed out how Google’s own Lidar system cost less than 10% of the $75,000 dollars of a bought-in unit a few years ago, adding that it was also technologically more advanced. “The goal is to make this technology accessible to millions of people,” he added. To date, Waymo Firefly vehicles have driven 2.5 million miles autonomously - equivalent to 300 years of typical human driving - and Krafcik stressed that testing was ramping up fast, with it taking the firm six years to cover its first million miles but just eight months to cover the most recent million miles. In addition, Waymo covers more than one billion miles of testing in its simulator each year. It’s on-road testing in California has also suffered substantially less autonomous-related incidents in the past year, with the “disengaged” incident rate falling from 0.8 times per 1000 to 0.2. “We believe we’re at an inflection point where we can start to see the benefit of this technology,” concluded Krafcik. “We can see uses for a car that drives itself at the push of a button across personal transport, ride hailing, logistical transport and last-mile transport services - but we also see potential to create truly exciting new uses too. “We know there’s a better way. An 'almost self-driving car' won’t cut it. We’re thinking beyond a single-use business model. We’re bringing to market a self-driving platform that makes getting around safely easy for everyone. Some projects we may do alone and some we may do with partners. We’re mastering hardware and software to build a better driver for a fully self-driving car.” Click here to read the latest on Apple's self-driving car project Reports - Apple is no longer building its own self-driving car Tweet Widget Facebook Like Google Plus One Tweet Widget Facebook Like Google Plus One Our Verdict Honda Civic The Honda Civic is an impressive achievement and a worthy rival to the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus, but it isn't quite up to class-leading standards Join the debate Comments 1 ammythomas21 ammythomas21 9 January 2017 My mothers neighbour is working part time and averaging $9000 a month.

Vehicles tested in California by Waymo, the autonomous car company owned Google parent Alphabet Inc., had a much lower rate of "disengagements" last year, compared with 2015. Disengagements happen when a human tester needs to take control of a self-driving car, either to avoid an accident or respond to technical problems. Waymo Chief Executive Officer John Krafcik shared the data during a speech on Sunday at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. California requires companies with permits to test autonomous vehicles to disclose the metric. The figure is one measure of the effectiveness of the nascent technology in the real world.  In 2015, Alphabet reported 341 disengagements during 424,331 autonomous miles driven in California. That was 0.8 disengagements per thousand miles. In 2016, the rate improved to 0.2, according to Krafcik.  "As our software and hardware becomes more robust through our testing, we’re driving this number down further," he said during a keynote address in Detroit. Krafcik also highlighted advances in Waymo’s sensor technology.  Krafcik and Alphabet have have stressed the safety of its driverless technology in appeals to regulators and industry partners in recent years. Google began testing its vehicles in 2009. Several rivals have emerged since then. Five of the six other companies with California permits in 2015 reported worse disengagement rates than Alphabet. Volkswagen AG came closest to Alphabet, with a rate of 17.4 disengagements per thousand miles. Tesla Motors Inc., the seventh licensed company, didn’t report the figures. Disengagement rates could vary for different reasons. Companies may count disengagements in different ways. And some companies may be putting their vehicles through tougher tests, increasing the chance of human intervention. Others could be testing simpler situations. Krafcik said Sunday that Waymo’s system has got better at handling fog, rain and snow. In coming weeks, California’s DMV plans to report 2016 disengagement numbers from several other companies testing autonomous vehicles in the state, including General Motor’s Cruise unit, and Ford Motor Co.   In his speech Sunday, Krafcik said Waymo will begin testing self-driving minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV this year in Arizona and California. Arizona, which is also hosting autonomous tests by Uber Technologies Inc., doesn’t require disengagement reports. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The announcement came from John Krafcik, head of Google’s Waymo unit, whose search for partners to develop and install the company’s autonomous driving technology into real cars has so far yielded only an alliance with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and a pending deal with Honda Motor Co . Headlining a future mobility conference during the show’s media preview, Krafcik said Waymo’s latest set of self-driving hardware and software incorporated a new array of sensors, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar, all developed and built in-house. Krafcik said Waymo had reduced the cost of a single lidar unit by 90 per cent, to about US$7,500 (RM33,581). Among major outside suppliers of this technology, Velodyne Lidar Inc and Quanergy Systems Inc both have said they are developing smaller solid-state lidar units that eventually would cost US$200 or less. Waymo’s existing test fleet of self-driving cars, including some specially equipped Lexus RX450s and Google’s own “Firefly” prototypes, has accumulated nearly 2.5 million miles in less than eight years, mostly on city streets. Krafcik said Waymo planned to test the first self-driving Pacificas this month on public roads in California and Arizona.

Alphabet-owned company Waymo has slashed the price of lidar, a key component of self-driving cars that helps them see the world, by 90%, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said during a keynote address to kick off the Detroit Auto Show on Sunday. Lidar is the most expensive component of self-driving cars. As Krafcik noted in his address, a single unit cost $75,000 just a few years ago. A lidar sensor is attached to the top of a car where it spins and shoots out lasers to create high-resolution maps of the car's surroundings. "Just a few years ago, a single top-of-the-range lidar cost upwards of $75,000. Today, we’ve brought down that cost by more than 90%," Krafcik said. "As we look to scale, we will do even better, with the goal of making this technology accessible to millions of people." Waymo is also building all of its self-driving car hardware in-house to ensure that it can scale, Krafcik said. If Waymo has indeed managed to reduce that top-range lidar cost by more than 90%, the company is looking at a price of roughly $7,500 per sensor. Waymo originally used lidar manufactured by Velodyne in its early prototype cars. Since its collaboration with Waymo, Velodyne has reduced the price of its lidar to range from $8,000 to $30,000, depending on how many lasers it shoots out. Ford and China-based internet company Baidu have both invested $150 million in Velodyne for their self-driving car efforts. Google began hiring mechanical engineers to develop "novel lidar systems" in December 2015, marking a departure with Velodyne. Building self-driving technology to scale Waymo Waymo is making serious moves to bring its self-driving cars to market. Waymo is an independent company operating under Alphabet, Google's parent company, as of December. The tech giant has also partnered with Fiat Chrysler, which has supplied 100 Pacifica minivans integrated with Waymo's self-driving tech for testing on public roads in Arizona and California later this month. Waymo has recently changed some of its self-driving car plans in what appears to be an effort to bring the tech to market faster. Waymo originally was pursuing fully driverless cars without a steering wheel, brake, or gas pedals. In December, Waymo said that driver controls will not be removed due to the regulatory environment. The decision came as Waymo faced setbacks pursuing a steering-wheel-less car and felt mounting pressure from Uber, which has launched public trials for its self-driving cars in recent months. Waymo has also said it is not in the business of physically building cars, and that it intends to instead supply self-driving tech to other companies. Bringing its hardware efforts in-house instead of outsourcing from Velodyne, as well as reducing the price of components, is in-line with that strategy. Waymo has said it can see its self-driving tech being used for ride-hailing, personal transportation, public transit systems, and even trucking.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Keyboard Input Could Be Coming To Google Assistant By Tyler Lee on 01/08/2017 17:58 PST Image credit – Android Police One of the ways of interacting with Google Assistant on your Pixel device is through voice. However Google Assistant also lives in Google’s Allo messenger app, in which you interact with the AI using the keyboard. Now it looks like soon you could use keyboard input to interact with Google Assistant outside of Allo as well. This is according to Google’s beta application in which it was spotted that keyboard input could be an upcoming feature, thanks to the addition of a new keyboard icon. Presumably when tapped, it will change Google Assistant’s interface into one that you could write out commands using the keyboard. This might be ideal if you’re trying to do certain things and you can’t use your voice, or if Assistant is having a hard time trying to understand what you’re saying. In addition to keyboard input, the folks at Android Police who did the APK teardown also revealed that there could be a new feature called “Search gestures”, in which it sounds like you could activate Google Search through gestures instead of tapping the search bar. Whether or not this will actually be more efficient remains to be seen. No word on when Google plans on rolling out these new features but it could be that they will be server-side enabled, meaning that no action will be needed from your side, but we’ll keep our eyes peeled anyway.

Chinese talent takes the digital world by storm; giants set to invest big time When around 2,000 enthusiastic Chinese app-developers gathered for Google Inc's annual conference for their ilk in Beijing in December, they didn't allow sub-zero winter chills to dampen their enthusiasm for the event. Suitably impressed, Scott Beaumont, president of Google Greater China, told the large audience at the Beijing Google Developer Day, the biggest such event in the Asia-Pacific region, that Google "is here to know what Chinese (app-) developers want". The rapturous crowd cheered him on. Its internet search engine may have been out of the Chinese mainland since 2010, but Google, like other global tech giants such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, has ambitious plans for the world's largest mobile internet market. The California-based giant has launched a Chinese website for local app-developers and promised help to take their products global. The developments excited Yan Peng, a Shanghai-based app-developer, no end. "Finally, it's here. This is the best Christmas gift for me. I couldn't wait to ask for a day off to celebrate this moment." Such gushing praise was earlier common among Chinese consumers at the launch of much-awaited gadgets like, say, the latest version of the iPhone. But China is no longer just a humongous end-user market. Apps developed in China are increasingly popular among domestic and overseas users. For instance, Clean Master, a junk cleaning app, has over 400 million overseas users. Bigo Live, a live streaming app, boasts 7 million monthly active users from Southeast Asian countries, all of whom came on board within three months. Such developed-in-China apps abound these days. Call China an app-developer hub, if you will. This new facet of China is not lost on the world's tech giants. "China is now an indispensable part of the global developer community," said Ben Galbraith, head of product and developer relations at Google's developer product group. "Chinese developers are responsive to new technology and known for high efficiency." The trend started a few years back. In 2014, China nosed ahead of India in terms of software developers. Out of 18.5 million professional and amateur software developers globally, China accounted for 10 percent of them, while India had 9.8 percent, data from International Data Corp, the US IT consultancy, show. Data on the current scene is yet to emerge, but it is reasonable to assume that the mobile internet boom and China's digitalization push would likely have boosted the app-developer numbers significantly, said Sandy Shen, research director at Gartner Inc, a US-based technology research and advisory company. Sensing future potential, Apple has decided to set up a research and development center in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, South China, later this year. The US tech giant's Shenzhen announcement came after it set up its first China R&D center in Beijing in September last year. The work is still on and the total cost is expected to reach 300 million yuan (.6 million), and staff 500 employees eventually. 12> Also in the News Showbiz2016/06/16 13:58January 16 2017 09:36:19 Nicole Kidman Recalls Oscar Glory: Loneliest Time Attending Shanghai International Film Festival, Nicole Kidman talks about her role in "Grace of Monaco".

Or does it? Davey Winder runs the numbers. Android tops the CVE charts for most insecure product (ahead of Debian, Ubuntu and Adobe Flash) and Google comes second (behind Oracle but ahead of both Adobe and Microsoft) in the insecure vendor listings. That's according to a summation of the stats for 2016. If we dig a little deeper than the headline figures, and take the last couple of years into account, things don't get any the rosier for Google. Both Apple products, and Apple as a vendor, have become ‘more secure' over time using this metric whereas Google has gone in the opposite direction. Measuring security by the number of distinct vulnerabilities disclosed across the year, however, is not really an accurate metric. We asked the IT security industry what it made of the numbers, and the ‘face value' headlines they have generated. Ian Trump, global cyber security strategist for SolarWinds, was of the opinion that “the CVE numbers speak the truth” and “Android will always remain a security concern for Google”.   He went on to insist that there's little financial incentive for Google to improve the security of Android, and he wouldn't be surprised if Android was spun off from Google parent company Alphabet in the next few years. Most everyone else disagreed, however. Take Craig Young, a security researcher at Tripwire, who said that “counting CVEs to gauge relative security levels is a fundamentally flawed practice”, adding it is “discredited by many in the industry including some of the engineers responsible for creating the CVE numbering system”. Stephen Gates, chief research intelligence analyst at NSFOCUS, agrees. He told us that “just because a vendor has a high number of known vulnerabilities, does not mean they have inferior products”. A more meaningful metric, he suggested, would be the how quickly patches were issued. Another nail in the coffin of the CVE charts as a measure of insecurity was hammered home by Jonathan Couch, SVP of Strategy at ThreatQuotient, who in conversation insisted that the real tell for these stats is “how many vulnerabilities were leveraged as actual exploits in the wild”. After all, if the bad guys can't leverage a vulnerability to steal data, for financial or political gain, then it really doesn't matter much in the real world. Consider that Android vulnerabilities tend to require a malicious application to get into the official app store, past the checks that are made, and then for users to download and execute them. This exploit execution simply doesn't happen for most such vulnerabilities. Then there's the open source factor to consider. Lawrence Munro, senior director of SpiderLabs EMEA at Trustwave, points out that “the approach of open source vs. closed source (Android (ASOP) vs. Apple iOS for example) influences the number of bug discoveries, as there's more to work with when you have the source code". And, as High-Tech Bridge CEO Ilia Kolochenko adds, “Android is an open source, very popular, emerging and developing product, it's totally normal that new vulnerabilities are regularly discovered.” Indeed, open source projects will always get more bugs reported courtesy of many more eyes on the code. But it's “hard to explain the precipitous increase of Android bugs compared with last year”, according to Drie CTO Tom Van Neerijnen. Arian Evans, VP of product strategy at RiskIQ, is not so surprised. “The recent spike in Android vulnerabilities isn't particularly concerning or surprising; in many ways, this may be a positive.” Indeed, Google only launched its official Android Bug Bounty programme in June 2015 so what we are seeing now is likely a result of the timing of this programme. Paul Calatayud, CTO of FireMon, agrees and points to the time when the Apple OS was considered secure based upon the low number of disclosed vulnerabilities. Over time, as Apple increased in popularity in the workplace, the vulnerabilities started to be discovered. “I would look at this trend and pattern,” Calatayud says, “and apply it to Google as the main observation.” Some would look outside of Google for the reason why Android tops the CVE listings for 2016. Jonathan Sander, VP of product strategy at Lieberman Software, told us, "Many of the vulnerabilities reported are sourced from their many, many partners involved in the Android ecosystem – from Qualcomm to Samsung and even another CVE chart-topper Linux." So, should we be concerned by Google and Android taking such high positions in the CVE charts? We'll leave the last word to MWR InfoSecurity's managing director John Fitzpatrick who says, “These numbers should be reassuring to Google customers; we should be concerned about the companies who are not assigning CVEs and question what security assurance activities they are undertaking."

Las Vegas Sun January 15, 2017 Currently: 56° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events Sports betting UNLV sports Gaming Education NHL in Las Vegas Smith's World HS Basketball Newsletter signup 0 Comments Waymo self-driving minivan will start test drives this month Paul Sancya / AP John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company created by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, introduces a Chrysler Pacifica hybrid outfitted with Waymo’s own suite of sensors and radar Sunday, Jan. 8, 2017, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. By Dee-Ann Durbin, Associated Press Sunday, Jan. 8, 2017 | 4:46 p.m. Detroit —  Waymo, Google's self-driving car division, will start testing its new fleet of minivans on public roads in California and Arizona later this month. The minivans, built in collaboration with Fiat Chrysler, are Chrysler Pacifica hybrids outfitted with Waymo's own suite of sensors and radar. Waymo and FCA announced their partnership in May. In a speech at the Detroit auto show Sunday, CEO John Krafcik revealed that Waymo built the sensors, radar and software for the new minivans itself. Krafcik said the company felt the system would work better if it was developed specifically for self-driving instead of using off-the-shelf parts. "A single integrated system means that all the different parts of a self-driving car work together seamlessly," Krafcik said. Waymo also was able to significantly lower the cost of the system, Krafcik said. The rooftop lidar — which uses lasers to give the car a three-dimensional picture of the world — cost $75,000 a few years ago. Waymo has brought that cost down by 90 percent and has developed its own short-range and long-range lidar. Waymo's long-range lidar can see a football helmet two football fields away. Krafcik didn't say exactly how Waymo lowered the costs. But the announcement could concern suppliers like Velodyne, which makes lidar systems used by Ford Motor Co. and others, and Delphi Corp., which is developing its own autonomous driving system. Stephanie Brinley, an auto analyst for IHS Markit, said Google won't control the market for self-driving technology, so other suppliers with go ahead with development of their own systems. But some smaller players in the nascent industry are "going to fall away," she said. Waymo has repeatedly said that it doesn't plan to build its own cars, but provide self-driving systems to established carmakers, car-sharing services or others. In addition to FCA, Honda Motor Co. recently announced that it's in talks with Waymo about using its technology in Honda vehicles. Krafcik said Waymo, which has been developing self-driving cars for eight years, expects to reach 3 million miles of test-driving this May. 0 Comments Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

Home Industry In India, public cloud expected to grow 30%: Google Cloud honcho Rick Harshman In India, public cloud expected to grow 30%: Google Cloud honcho Rick Harshman In September last year, Google announced that it was re-branding its cloud business geared towards enterprises as Google Cloud. By: Shruti Dhapola | Published: January 9, 2017 6:14 AM “A region is in a geographic location and it is made up of multiple zones. In India, we pre-announced there will be three zones consisting of multiple data centres.” In September last year, Google announced that it was re-branding its cloud business geared towards enterprises as Google Cloud. More importantly, it announced it will be bringing a data cloud region to Mumbai in 2017 and plans to make significant investments in its cloud enterprise business in India. Google’s Rick Harshman, managing director for Google Cloud Platform in JAPAC (Japan and Asia Pacific Region), spoke to Shruti Dhapola about the future of cloud and the upcoming data region in Mumbai. Edited excerpts. On Google’s plans for the cloud business, especially in India: Google has always been a cloud-level company, before cloud was a common word. We have seven consumer-based services that have a billion-plus users, the eighth is actually Google Cloud platform where we have over a billion people end users running applications, workloads on our platform. On the cloud side, we have clients such as InShorts, DBCorp and a division of Mahindra. In the last year alone we have invested $9.9 billion in our infrastructure and a lot of that has been in Asia. We just launched our second cloud region in Asia which is in Japan, that was in November. We also pre-announced an additional three cloud regions, one of which will be in Mumbai in 2017. That will be important because there are millions of businesses here. You May Also Want To Watch: On cloud region in Mumbai and how it works: A region is in a geographic location and it is made up of multiple zones. In India, we pre-announced there will be three zones consisting of multiple data centres. You have to have multiple data centres if you want to create highly available, fall-tolerant applications. That’s a huge differentiator vis-a-vis running the infrastructure in a premise facility. If you have an incident whether it is a flood or a power disconnection, you will end up being offline. So you need multiple locations, that’s what we mean by region and then zones. Mumbai will be the region, and there will be three zones, but not necessarily three data centres. It could be more than that. It’s already being worked on and the zones will go live sometime in 2017. On Google’s investment in training people for cloud business: We are making investments in ground training; in September we announced our training and certification programme. For upscaling in a market like India, what are the skills that people need as they evolve into their careers? It’s not too big a statement to say that cloud will be front and centre, and it will be important for people to have those cloud-specific skills. Certifications around Google Cloud is going to be a differentiator. We will provide Google-led training and work with Indian partners to provide training. We have a pretty large goal on the number of people that we look to train and enable over the next few years. On Google’s machine-learning APIs for cloud segment: When you think of our machine learning capabilities, it is already a restful API and we have already created the model. So if you (as a business) want to take advantage of the speech API or the vision API or natural language or translate, all of those are already pre-built. Now if you have your own machine learning staff on site, you can use your own data, you can create your own models using the technology that we developed called TensorFlow. On the key differentiator for Google Cloud: We are making a lot of investments to have engineering-to-engineering relationships with companies, which is a big differentiator. We also launched in September something called the Advanced Solution Lab. If you are a company and have identified business problems that you’re trying to solve, and you believe that machine learning can help address those business problems, Google engineers will work with you. On challenges to the cloud business and future growth: Cloud is so nascent here, but it is growing extremely fast. Cloud adoption is just 5% of IT spend across the board globally. Analysts say, by 2020, public cloud will be $85-100 billion globally. In India, public cloud is expected to grow by 30%. So there’s a fast growing market. If you are medium-sized or a large enterprise in India, you will be running thousands of applications. Companies want to have options in cloud—they are already thinking about how to have a multi-cloud strategy. It’s not “am I going to go cloud”, it’s “how am I going to go cloud and who are the partners I want to work with”. I think Google will be one of those, but I am not naive enough to think we’ll be the only ones available. Please Wait while comments are loading...

CEO John Krafcik also said the company would later this month begin testing Chrysler minivans outfitted with its self-driving system on public roads in Arizona and California. "What we're bringing to market is a self-driving technology platform," Krafcik said during a presentation at the annual Detroit auto show that often features product debuts from auto makers. John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo speaks at a press conference at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 8, 2017 ©Geoff Robins (AFP) Waymo and Chrysler have been building specially-outfitted Pacifica hybrid minivans that are autonomous. The minivans were first unveiled in December. Krafcik said the self-driving project was aimed at creating a platform, not working on any one specific product. "This integrated software and hardware platform will allow us to deliver products and services," Krafcik said. "Some of these we may do on our own. Some we may work on with partners." The first autonomous Chrysler minivans will appear on public roads in Arizona and California later this month, Krafcik said. "As we get ready to scale...using mass-produced vehicles becomes an imperative," he said. The self-driving car subsidiary of the technology giant has already conducted millions of miles of testing on earlier iterations of its autonomous system. Krafcik said they have managed to reduce the cost of its laser-guided radar system by 90 percent, from an original $75,000 price tag. "We'll take that cost down even further, with the goal of making this technology accessible to millions of people," he said. "We're at the point now where we believe we're at an inflection point where we can begin to realize the potential of this technology."

The minivans, built in collaboration with Fiat Chrysler, are Chrysler Pacifica hybrids outfitted with Waymo's own suite of sensors and radar. Waymo and FCA announced their partnership in May. In a speech at the Detroit auto show Sunday, CEO John Krafcik revealed that Waymo built the sensors, radar and software for the new minivans itself. John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company created by Google's parent company, Alphabet introduces a Chrysler Pacifica hybrid outfitted with Waymo's own suite of sensors and radar at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Sunday, Jan. 8, 2017. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) Krafcik said the company felt the system would work better if it was developed specifically for self-driving instead of using off-the-shelf parts. "A single integrated system means that all the different parts of a self-driving car work together seamlessly," Krafcik said. Waymo also was able to significantly lower the cost of the system, Krafcik said. The rooftop lidar — which uses lasers to give the car a three-dimensional picture of the world — cost $75,000 a few years ago. Waymo has brought that cost down by 90 percent and has developed its own short-range and long-range lidar. Waymo's long-range lidar can see a football helmet two football fields away. Krafcik didn't say exactly how Waymo lowered the costs. But the announcement could concern suppliers like Velodyne, which makes lidar systems used by Ford Motor Co. and others, and Delphi Corp., which is developing its own autonomous driving system. Stephanie Brinley, an auto analyst for IHS Markit, said Google won't control the market for self-driving technology, so other suppliers with go ahead with development of their own systems. But some smaller players in the nascent industry are "going to fall away," she said. Waymo has repeatedly said that it doesn't plan to build its own cars, but provide self-driving systems to established carmakers, car-sharing services or others. In addition to FCA, Honda Motor Co. recently announced that it's in talks with Waymo about using its technology in Honda vehicles. Krafcik said Waymo, which has been developing self-driving cars for eight years, expects to reach 3 million miles of test-driving this May.

Despite being shut out of all the other awards, Moonlight has won the main award of the night and it’s a hugely deserving win. A standing ovation from the audience implies that it’s also a popular result at the ceremony. Barry Jenkins, as eloquent as ever, will hopefully be accepting an Oscar next month. And that’s the last award of the night! Updated at 11.08pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.01pm EST 23:01 WINNER: Isabelle Huppert (Elle), best actress in a motion picture – drama Benjamin Lee Woah! Insane and brilliant surprise here that Huppert wins for her performance in the pitch black rape revenge comedy from Paul Verhoeven. She is equally shocked and it’s a fascinatingly barmy choice from the HFPA. She was an outsider for an Oscar nomination but now this seems like it will happen for sure. Isabelle Huppert totally guffawed at Leonardo DiCaprio’s pronunciation of her name as well which needs a gif right away. Oh and she carried on talking even after the sound cut out.

He’s already apologised for his bedraggled appearance on the red carpet, which is for a film he is currently shooting. He likened it to looking like a caveman. Awkward music cutting him off again.

The Globes does love a chance to justify the addition of the word “musical” to this category but it’s also a deserving winner. Every single winner from the film has crowbarred in a narrative about how daring the film is and what a risk it was to make it. But, come on, it’s a starry musical, a genre that typically picks up awards and scores well at the box office. So lay off that one, yeah?

A refreshing change here for a category that often cheats by giving the award to Jeffrey Tambor for starring in Transparent, a drama with comedic elements. Glover is overwhelmed again. He said: “I grew up in a house where magic wasn’t allowed so everyone in here is magic.” He talks about doing things that he never thought possible. Good speech and shows that the small screen choices continue to be a tad more daring than the movie picks. Updated at 2.23am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.24pm EST 22:24 WINNER: Damien Chazelle (La La Land), best director Benjamin Lee And yeah, we saw this one coming. It’s a big night for the romantic musical and the 31-year-old picks up his second award for the night. He got played off with a musical cue, which seemed a tad harsh. Which also means that it looks as if Moonlight might go away empty-handed tonight, despite being the most rewarded film of the season so far from the critics circles. It also means that La La Land has really improved its chances at the Oscars.

Android and iOS both have smart photo services built in nowadays, but what happens when you want to jump from one to the other? Here's what you need to know. In this guide we'll be tackling the challenge of moving your whole photo library from one service to the other: this is a full traded-in-my-iPhone-for-a-Pixel scenario, a clean break where you're switching from Apple Photos to Google Photos or back the other way. Image: Google For a lot of people it might be better to have a foot in both camps, at least for some photos or for some of the time, but for simplicity's sake we won't go into every possible scenario here. You can in fact use these services alongside each other pretty easily, but in this case we'll tackle going from one to the other wholesale. It's also worth noting these are not exactly directly comparable services, with Apple's photo offerings very much baked into its hardware and software, and Google Photos very much web-first and operating independently of your computers, phones and tablets. Switching from Apple Photos to Google Photos Before you jump to Google Photos you need to decide if you want to store your photos (and videos) at their original resolution or whether you're happy to put up with some resizing — images are stored at a maximum of 16 megapixels and videos are stored at a maximum of 1080p HD. If you choose the second option, you can store as much as you want, for free. If you want to keep everything as it is, you need to think about paying for Google Drive storage, as you only get 15GB for free. Prices start at 100GB for $US1.99 ($3) a month. Once you've decided, you need to work out where your photos are, and given the different apps on macOS and iOS, and the recent upgrades to both, you could be forgiven for not being too sure. Thankfully, Google Photos isn't too fussed. Download the Google Photos desktop client for macOS and mobile app for iOS and both will get to work picking up all the pictures from your computers and iDevices. The desktop app asks which photo libraries you want to back up when you start it, and the iOS app simply backs up everything it can find. The only images and videos that might get missed are those you've uploaded to iCloud and deleted from your devices, if you're using iCloud. To get these files back on macOS, launch Photos, then open the Photos menu, choose Preferences, switch to iCloud and make sure Download Originals to Mac is selected. On iOS, if you have the space, open Settings then tap iCloud, Photos and Download and Keep Originals. If for whatever reason you can't get your iCloud photos back to a Mac or iOS device, the export options from iCloud on the web are a little less than stellar. Pictures can be downloaded individually easily enough, but for bulk downloads you have to use the Shift or Cmd keys to select multiple items at once, then click the download icon. Once saved somewhere, they can be uploaded to Google Photos using a desktop client or just your web browser. Switching from Google Photos to Apple Photos As we've said, Google Photos lives on the web, but getting all your pictures and videos back down again isn't too difficult — though it might take some time if you've got a massive photo library and a sluggish internet connection. With Apple Photos, you don't have to store your pictures in the cloud, but if you do then you'll probably need to pay for extra storage. The Google Photos desktop client for macOS doesn't have two-way sync, but the one for Google Drive does. First, go to Google Drive on the web, open the Settings page (via the cog icon) and tick the box marked Automatically put your Google Photos into a folder in My Drive under the General tab. That doesn't change anything about what's stored in Google Photos, it just makes everything visible in Google Drive. Then, download and install the macOS client for Google Drive, and make sure the Google Photos folder is selected in the list of folders to sync, which will be displayed during the setup process. Hey presto, all your photos and videos are pulled down from the cloud. In the Photos app on your Mac, pick File then Import to load in the newly downloaded content. It's only if you don't have a Mac computer to hand that difficulties arise — if you're using Apple's photo services solely on iPhones, iPads, and the web, maybe. If you have a Windows machine to hand, you can use the same trick as above to get the images and videos downloaded. Then, instead of running the Photos app on macOS, use iTunes and your iDevice, or just iCloud on the web, to get everything up to the iCloud Photo Library. Alternatively you can use the Google Takeout service to download all of your pictures and video from Google Photos if you don't want to go down the Google Drive syncing route. All of your stuff gets served up as a compressed folder which you can then extract and move to Apple's apps on the desktop, on mobile and in the cloud. A computer of some kind really is essential though as a stopgap between Google Photos and Apple's Photos apps, even if you're planning to use nothing but an iPhone and iCloud Photo Library for the rest of your life. In other words you can't go straight from cloud service to cloud service. Without investing too much time and effort you should be up and running on your new photo management system and ready to take and store pictures again — at least until you decide to switch to something new.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube When you talk with friends, everytime you want to bring up a topic you don’t have to go “Hey <name>” because that would be weird, right? This is why sometimes using voice assistant platforms like Google Assistant or Siri might be weird because you’ll always have to keep prompting it to activate it. However on Android TV, it has been noticed that Google Assistant has been upgraded where it can actually hold continuous conversations with its user. As you might have heard, Google Assistant is arriving on Android TV and the continuous conversation appears to be a few feature that will be part of it. Basically what this means is that Google Assistant will keep listening for a short while after your latest query in case there’s anything else that comes to mind. For example you might want to check the time and weather of a country that you’re visiting, so you could ask for the time and follow it up with the weather without having to go, “OK Google” to activate the second query. This is slightly different from follow-up questions in which you would still need to activate the AI through its keywords. We reckon there might be some who might be too comfortable with the fact that it’s still listening once the initial query has ended, so we have to wonder if there’s maybe a settings that allows you to turn it off. In the meantime you can check out the video above by Android Police to see the feature in action. Filed in Gadgets >General. Read more about android tv, Google and google assistant.

But those days are long gone, with many couples working full time, living far afield from friends and family and only on nodding terms with the neighbours. Social media pages for parents have sprung up to fill the void and while Facebook exchanges can be a source of useful information, support and entertainment, they can also turn nasty surprisingly quickly when posts go rogue.

More videos Twitter, Google, Facebook change policies Online media giants are changing their policies to combat bullying and improve accuracy. Emma Lovell, a businesswoman and mother-of-two from Queenscliff, was stunned by the level of aggression she witnessed in groups supposedly established to offer support. "I would see the most hurtful comments on Facebook every day," she says. "Women would say things to each other online they wouldn't dream of saying in a face to face conversation. They just vent." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Facebook group moderators are on alert for outbreaks of bad behaviour. Photo: Bloomberg Lovell became so disenchanted with the cyber hate she witnessed, she recently set up her own Facebook group, Mumsomnia, with the aim of encouraging women to meet face to face. RMIT University information technology lecturer John Lenarcic​ says social media can be a double edged-sword, providing great support but also fertile ground for bullying. Advertisement "It's almost like a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde world online," he says. "In real life people can be perfectly reasonable but online they can be completely hostile." Rachel Chappell​ was alert to this when she established the Facebook group North Shore Mums in 2012, hoping to make a few local connections as she was new to the area. Since then the group has grown to 20,000 members, publishing 200 new posts a day. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Rachel Chappell - with her children Zara, 4, Ella, 11 months, and Scarlett, 6 - started a group to help her make connections with other mums. Photo: Dallas Kilponen "Obviously, with so many members there are going to be differences of opinion," she says. "Ninety-nine per cent of the time people are supportive and respectful but the other 1 per cent can be quite nasty and we don't tolerate that. "The benefits of being able to share information and advice far outweigh the drawbacks of a small minority who just want to cause trouble." Facebook groups for parents have exploded over the past five years. There are groups for parents in specific locations as well as those with particular interests. Posts are as diverse as the membership, covering everything from domestic violence to where to find a reasonably-priced plumber. There are some topics guaranteed to spark heated debate  but even more prosaic subjects such as shopping centre car parks can get fingers tapping heatedly on keyboards. When Justine Slapp​ co-founded Hills District Mums in 2013 she wanted to connect a few hundred mums in Sydney's north west. The group now has 13,000 members, 2000 posts a week, 15,000 comments on those posts and 14 moderators.  "I was a real control freak in the early days," Slapp says. "I would get really nervous about what people were posting."  Slapp does not believe in shutting down debate and avoids deleting posts unless absolutely necessary. "People hate their posts or comments being deleted," she says. "You're taking away someone's voice; silencing them." For all the outbreaks of bad behaviour online, there are many more examples of generosity, according to Anita Vitanova​, who founded Inner West Mums in 2013. "Recently a mum posted that she didn't have a particular type of syringe she needed to give medication to her child," she says. "Another mum saw it, realised she had that type of syringe and drove it over to the poster." Vitanova has found many of Inner West Mums' 17,000 members post about non-child related topics. "When you are at home with a baby all day you do crave adult conversation," she says. "You see some really intelligent discussions on the group – it's not all about teething and where to get the best babycino." New to the Facebook mums' groups? Here's a list of landmines to watch out for. Tread carefully Feeding: Doesn't matter whether it's breast or bottle, this is guaranteed to spark lively debate. Method of delivery: Drug free with dolphin music and essential oils? In the bath at a birthing centre? At home? In an operating theatre? There are plenty of ways to have a baby and just as many opinions about it. Amber alert Education: Back in the day, choosing a school for your child was a simple affair. They either went to the local comprehensive high school or went private. Smart children went to selective schools. These days the choices seem endless and so are peoples' views on the matter. Paid work versus staying at home: Whether you've chosen to stop paid work to raise a family or raced straight back to the office, there's no easy answer. Life is complex and so is this question.  Sound the emergency signal Vaccines: A casual post about new research on immunisation can unleash a torrent of opinion, some informed, some not so much. Most groups have guidelines about health-related posts. Some automatically delete any posts about the false link between vaccines and autism.  Circumcision: As with many sensitive subjects, there's not a lot of middle ground on this one. One person's medical procedure is another person's child abuse.

But what about the obverse? As hardware upgrade cycles lengthen and computing paradigms undergo rapid transformation, how are the reigning tech giants pushing to keep their growth momentum going? In April 2015, Apple hit its highest ever market capitalization of $774 billion. It would have taken a brave man to bet against the firm Steve Jobs revived being the first to the fabled trillion-dollar market cap mark. But the tech industry is a fickle beast. Apple’s market cap now is $619 billion. That still makes it the leader of the pack by a distance, but it no longer appears as invincible as it once did. Ann Winblad, one of Silicon Valley’s reigning power brokers—a venture capitalist who has spent over three decades observing the industry from up close—has dismissed its chances of hitting a trillion dollars. She’d rather hang her hat on Google’s parent company, Alphabet, with a current market cap of $551 billion. Other analysts point to Microsoft, bouncing back from its long twilight, or Amazon, currently at $484 billion and $368 billion, respectively. The reason for Apple’s slowing down a touch isn’t particularly surprising in hindsight. Its meteoric climb was predicated on its being a personal computing company—one that built its brand around creating new product categories, delivering best-in-class products and a polished user experience. Here’s the thing: personal computing devices, from computers to smartphones, are good enough now to obviate the need for frequent upgrades. And just as Apple lapped Microsoft by creating the smartphone and tablet categories that contributed to the traditional personal computer industry dwindling, future growth in the tech industry will likely come from two areas where it lacks a qualitative edge. The first of these is cloud computing. The ability to rent on-demand processing power, storage and software online is, essentially, the equivalent of division of labour and labour specialization in conventional industries. It sidesteps the need for a great deal of capital expenditure. And it enables greater efficiency in resource allocation, allowing companies to upgrade capacity as and when needed, then scale down again. The potential is obvious. Amazon has an early mover advantage here notwithstanding its image as primarily an e-commerce company. It started Amazon Web Services a decade and more ago, originally intended for its own use but eventually made available to others. It has captured about a third of the market now, leaving Google and Microsoft far behind. The latter are moving to correct this; there is a reason Satya Nadella, formerly head of Microsoft’s cloud business, was made the Redmond giant’s chief executive. Microsoft, after all, reigned supreme in the enterprise space. This is a natural evolution—renting out computing power and software to companies instead of selling software to them. The second area is the linked spheres of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The battle to control homes as entire ecosystems—smart homes—is the most high-profile aspect of this. As daily devices from microwaves to refrigerators to cars become networked, there are two prerequisites for unlocking their full potential: intuitive ways to control them via natural language recognition and algorithms to analyse the constant stream of data from them and enable predictive behaviour and increased efficiency. Apple may have started the AI wars with Siri on its smartphones and tablets, but Amazon, again, stole a march with the Alexa AI hosted on its Echo speaker and hub. Google has followed suit with Google Home, and Microsoft has recently announced Project Evo, an initiative to build similar hubs. And it’s worth keeping in mind that the scope for enterprise applications of AI and IoT is considerably larger than that for the consumer market; the learnings from the latter will be applied to the former. There are no certainties in the tech industry, of course. There was a time when companies like IBM and Oracle led the rest. And while the control the reigning tech giants have established protects them from competitors, it also opens them up to unexpected challenges, such as from European regulators wary of monopolistic behaviour. But for now, it seems the primary battles will play out between them—and the contours of those battles will impact both the functioning of enterprises and how individuals interact with technology that not too long ago used to be static and desk-bound.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:50 AM, January 9, 2017 Updated: 7:10 AM, January 9, 2017 DETROIT - Google <GOOGL.O> unveiled its latest self-driving system in a Chrysler Pacifica minivan during a Sunday preview ahead of the Detroit auto show, saying the technology is more reliable and affordable. The announcement came from John Krafcik, head of Google's Waymo unit, whose search for partners to develop and install the company's autonomous driving technology into real cars has so far yielded only an alliance with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles <FCHA.MI><FCAU.N> and a pending deal with Honda Motor Co <7267.T>. Headlining a future mobility conference during the show's media preview, Krafcik said Waymo's latest set of self-driving hardware and software incorporated a new array of sensors, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar, all developed and built in-house. Krafcik said Waymo had reduced the cost of a single lidar unit by 90 percent, to about $7,500.

Auto Tech by Chris Paukert January 8, 2017 1:30 PM PST @cpautoscribe Up Next New 2018 Buick Enclave expected at the New York Auto Show After seemingly stalling out in the public eye for a while, Google's self-driving car plans appear to be accelerating. Strongly. John Krafcik, CEO of the company's newly created Waymo division, has just shown off the company's autonomous Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan at the Detroit Auto Show. In fact, whether Google's autonomous efforts really ever paused in the first place remains an open question, because from the looks of the progress that Krafcik has outlined, things may have remained "all systems go" all along. Waymo's fleet of 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans hit the road this year.Photo by Waymo According to Krafcik, Waymo has taken the development of all self-driving-related sensors in-house to ensure seamless integration. The new network of sensors, including camera system, radar and Lidar are not just able to see things more accurately and from further afield, they're also cheaper than they were in the company's previous hardware packages. How much cheaper? For example, Krafcik notes that "Just a few years ago, a single top-of-the-range lidar cost upwards of $75,000. Today, we've brought down that cost by more than 90 percent. That's nine, zero. As we look to scale, we will do even better, with the goal of making this technology accessible to millions of people." That suggests the Lidar sensor costs around $7,500, which is still much too expensive for any traditional production car to absorb, but it's significant progress that will likely improve at scale. The company's new vision system incorporates no fewer than eight modules with multiple sensors, and a 360-degree forward-facing "super high resolution multi-sensor model," which Krafcik claims can now detect distant construction cones while the vehicle is running at full speed. Importantly, Waymo says it has made strides in radar development, too, and its new 360-degree system doesn't just track forward-moving vehicles, it can also register rear-approaching ones, too. Radar is seen as a particularly important tool in the fight to make self-driving cars work safely in inclement weather like fog, rain and snow, all of which can wreak havoc on sensors at any speed. 6 Waymo's self-driving Chrysler Pacifica shines up for Detroit Auto Show Speaking of speed, the number of autonomous test miles Google's prototypes have racked up is ramping up sharply. Krafcik notes that it took six years to achieve their first million autonomously driven miles, yet it only took 16 months to log the next million, and they are on track to reach three million miles this May, with that third milestone taking just 8 months. How much are Waymo's self-driving cars improving? The company claims a fourfold improvement in its disengagement figures over the last 12 months, a figure it's been working particularly hard to chip away at. Among its California-based test vehicles, Waymo says its cars are testing at "0.2 disengagements" per thousand miles driven, compared to 0.8 in 2015. Says Krafcik, "Now we believe we're at an inflection point where we can begin to realize the potential of this technology." Disengagements are particularly important success metric for Waymo, because the company is driving headlong toward full Level 4 autonomy, wherein passengers never need to take control of the vehicle. During his speech, Krafcik took a moment to subtly call out those pursuing part-time cars at Level 3 and below: "An 'almost' self-driving one -- what one might call 'aspirational autonomy -- it simply won't cut it," he said. The protuberances all over the Pacifica's bodywork hold Google-developed sensors.Photo by Waymo Of course, Google reps remain mum on what their ultimate goal for developing all this self-driving technology is anyhow. Whether the company plans to manufacture, sell or rent their own Waymo-branded vehicles, whether they intend to license their technology to legacy automakers or outside firms -- or any combination thereof -- remains an open question. In truth, Google's ambitions in this arena remain one of the biggest mysteries in the entire car industry. But the fact that Waymo has now acknowledged that it is going to the tremendous trouble and expense of developing its own full array of sensors should give pause to analysts and pundits who have been speculating that Google is increasingly only interested in being a software provider for autonomous vehicles. It may not yet be any clearer as to just what this Silicon Valley juggernaut has up its automotive sleeve, but it appears the world is at least a bit closer to finding out what Google -- and Waymo -- has in store.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Jan 8, 2017, 4:30pm EST Photos by Sean O'Kane share tweet Linkedin Waymo, the self-driving car startup spun-off from Google late last year, will be deploying its fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans onto public roads for the first time later this month, the company announced at the North American International Auto Show today. The minivans will be hitting the roads in Mountain View, California and Phoenix, Arizona, where the company’s self-driving Lexus SUVs have already driven thousands of miles over the past few years. Also today, Waymo gave the public its first look at the self-driving Pacificas, which have been under wraps since the deal between Google and Fiat Chrysler was first announced back in May 2016. "Mom, can you send the minivan to come pick me up from soccer practice today?" #NAIAS2017 pic.twitter.com/reUmaDZqzC— Andrew J. Hawkins (@andyjayhawk) January 8, 2017 But here’s the thing about these minivans. Waymo says that for the first time, its producing all the technology that enables its cars to completely drive themselves in-house. That means for the first time, the Google spin-off is building all its own cameras, sensors, and mapping technology, rather than purchasing parts off the shelf as it had done in the past. This allows the company to exert more control over its self-driving hardware, as well as bring the cost down to ridiculously cheap levels. In a speech in Detroit, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said that by building its own LIDAR sensors, for example, the company was shaving 90 percent off its costs. That means sensors that Google purchased for $75,000 back in 2009 now only cost $7,500 for Waymo to build itself. Waymo CEO John Krafcik To be sure, the cost of high-end LIDAR sensors have dropped precipitously over the years. Velodyne, a top supplier of LIDAR, retails its sensors for $7,999. But by building its own (or contracting out the manufacturing), Waymo is able to get LIDAR sensors to its exact specifications. For instance, Krafcik said the company developed two new types of LIDAR: short range and long range, allowing its vehicles to see people and objects very close to the car, as well as spot tiny objects far away. That said, Waymo has no interest in becoming an auto parts supplier like Delphi or 3M. Rather its focus is on forging partnerships with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) like Chrysler and Honda to purchase fleets of vehicles or retrofit for self-driving capabilities. Rumor has it that Waymo and Chrysler will eventually launch its own autonomous ride-sharing service to compete with the likes of Uber and Lyft, possibly by utilizing Google’s Waze mapping service. Indeed, during his remarks in Detroit, Krafcik said Waymo was eyeing a number of products, including ride-hailing, logistics, personal transportation, and last-mile solutions. When it spun off Waymo in early December, Google essentially conceded that it was dropping its plan to build its own car, instead refocusing its efforts on making the hardware and software needed to power self-driving. It may be too soon to say that Google is abandoning its plans to build a fleet of driverless cars without steering wheels and pedals. Previously, Krafcik made it clear that Waymo “is not a car company, there’s been some confusion on that point. We’re not in business of making better cars, we’re in the business of making better drivers.” In this Storystream Detroit Auto Show 2017: the biggest cars, concepts, and news The 2017 Detroit Auto Show in pictures Google’s new self-driving minivans will be hitting the road at the end of January 2017 View all 13 stories Next Up In Transportation Google takes another step towards launching its own self-driving Uber-killer with new patent The 2017 Detroit Auto Show in pictures This disassembled Aston Martin DB11 engine is engineering pornography Tesla’s latest Autopilot update rolls back its speed cap on undivided roads Why carmakers want to keep Apple and Google at arm's length Fiat Chrysler reportedly facing US criminal probe in emission scandal Now Trending Apple removes app that let you find your AirPods Rogue One's reshoots show how Disney saved the first standalone Star Wars movie This disassembled Aston Martin DB11 engine is engineering pornography The bizarro big business of Mark Wahlberg and national tragedy DirecTV Now appears to be a complete mess This Article has a component height of 70.

Waymo reveals completely homegrown sensor suite for Pacifica autonomous test car Posted Jan 8, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber debuts Movement, a new website offering access to its traffic data Waymo CEO John Krafcik is delivering the keynote address at the North American Auto Show’s Automobili-D conference Sunday, and he’s revealing a lot about the new Alphabet company’s progress and tech. Waymo, which began life as Google’s self-driving car project, has built all of its own sensors for use on its latest test vehicles, self-driving Pacifica minivans. Use of in-house sensors is huge, since it means Waymo can likely lay claim to controlling more of the self-driving car technology stack than any other player in operation today. Much like Apple can do a lot more than most of tis competitors because it owns and builds both the software and the hardware for its product suite, Waymo can claim tighter integration between its sensor hardware, sensor fusion software, image recognition and other aspects of its self-driving system. Waymo also claims individual performance benefits in each of its new sensors, including vision cameras, radars and LiDAR, saying each provides better resolution, sensing distance and accuracy than the hardware it has been using on prior vehicles. Krafcik also says that its decision to build out all of its sensor suites in-house has a significant talent benefit, since it means that it’ll now have deeply knowledgeable experts in each key sensing area, who can work closely with resources on the AI engineering side to ensure the best possible use of the gathered data by the car’s in-vehicle computational systems. Plus, development cycles should get shorter between generations of software and hardware thanks to their ability to control both. Waymo also created two new categories of LiDAR in its effort to develop its own sensors. Previous vehicles used a single top-mounted medium-range LiDAR, but new short and long range sensing units included in this package mean that the surround view the car sees is now complete, and more granular detail detection both up close and at a distance. Maybe most important from the perspective of Waymo’s ability to woo automaker partners is that building its own sensors gives the company significant cost advantages down the road. After the initial cost of research and development, cost reduction on a per unit basis should grow significantly over time, leading to Waymo’s ability to get a lot closer to reaching prices car OEMs are more comfortable at scale, more quickly. Krafcik says the cost of a single top-end LiDAR, which was $75,000 when Google began experimenting with self-driving vehicles, has dropped by 90 percent thanks to its efforts to build its own. Waymo will field Pacificas with this homegrown sensor suite on board beginning in Arizona and California later on this month, Krafcik announced on Sunday. Throughout its time as Google’s self-driving car project and more recently as Waymo, the company has racked up almost 2.5 million miles driven, with most of those accumulated on city streets. It just take them just eight more months to pass the 3 million mile threshold. Volume is key for autonomous tech not only for training systems, but also for helping prove to regulators and industry stakeholders that th tech is actually safe. Speaking of safety, Waymo says it’s had a four-fold improvement in performance of its vehicles in the last year, as measured by the number of disengagements (when a safety driver has to stop the self-driving software and take over manual control). In 2015, the number of disengagements was around 0.8 times per thousand miles in California, and currently, Waymo’s only seeing around 0.2 disengagements per thousand miles travelled. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Waymo Founded 2009 Overview Waymo stands for a new way forward in mobility.
