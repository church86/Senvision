Google Talk which was probably the first chat messenger from Google for Android platform will soon be merged into Hangouts. In 2013, when Google replaced GTalk with Hangouts, the company still gave an option to users to continue using GTalk. However, after June 26, users will be automatically directed to Hangouts as their default chat messenger for Android. In any case, if you miss the look and feel of Google Talk, Hangouts gives you an option in settings which will offer you a similar experience.   Meanwhile, Google is also removing the SMS integration from Hangouts. Instead, Google will now focus on Android Messages and help people to adopt it as their primary SMS service.     A recent Google blog post read - “In the next few weeks, you’ll see a notification in the classic Hangouts app to switch to another SMS app already on your phone for SMS or to download Android Messages if one isn’t available. Choosing a new messaging app will not impact your SMS message history, and all your messages will be accessible in whichever new app you choose.”   Other amendments include retiring following Gmail Labs - Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews.   Moreover, Google is also removing the ability to email Google+ profile and the use Google+ Circles from the Gmail. However, this is expected to happen not before April 24, 2017.   Source Google Google Talk Hangouts GTalk Hangouts SMS Android Android Messages Gmail First Published : Monday, March 27, 2017 - 11:14 Similar News Google follows Apple, introduces Free App of the Week on Play Store Google reportedly resolves the Bluetooth issue for Pixel and Pixel XL Google Maps now let's you to share your trips and location Android O first developer preview is out: Here is what is new Gmail Updated released: Stream videos in attachments prior to downloading Google working on three smartphones codenamed as muskie, walleye and taimen Advertisement Hot Trend on TMI Truecaller 8 brings Flash Messages, Truecaller Pay and more, partners with Airtel to bring the service to feature phones Apple rolls out iOS 10.3 with new Apple File System, Find My AirPods, smarter Siri and more WhatsApp text status feature makes its way back to iOS Google follows Apple, introduces Free App of the Week on Play Store Facebook Messenger to drop support for some Windows smartphones, Android and iOS devices in line Instagram will now blur out sensitive content on your feed Advertisement Product Finder Advertisement FOLLOW US ON Facebook Twitter Google Plus Youtube How To on TMI How to use your Android smartphone camera as webcam How to bring back the old WhatsApp Messenger: Step-by-Step Guide How to enable Google Assistant on your Android smartphone How to speed up your Android smartphone How to disable troublesome notifications from any app in Android Latest on TMI 01 Top 5 mid-range DSLR cameras in India 02 Oppo India regrets unpardonable action of an employee, promises strict action 03 Panasonic Lumix GH5 DSLR with Venus Engine, 6K photo capturing launched in India 04 LED TV brands like Samsung, Sony and LG cuts down on prices by 15 percent 05 Nubia Z17 Mini spotted on TENAA, specs revealed The Mobile Indian Latest Mobiles Panasonic Eluga Ray Max 32GB Rs.11499 Panasonic Eluga Ray Max 64GB Rs.12499 Panasonic Eluga Ray X Rs.8999 Intex Aqua 4G Mini Rs.4199 LG Stylus 3 Rs.18500 Oppo F3 Plus Rs.30990 Advertisement   Know Us About Us Advertise Contact Us Privacy Policy Articles News Reviews How To Top 5 Device Finder Mobiles Tablets Laptop Camera TV Refrigetator CONTACT US Contact Us Copyright © 2017 the mobile indian.

While Apple's recently announced Clips app is mainly focussed on easing up the process of video creation and sharing on social media, the search giant's upcoming app will reportedly make use of image recognition, allow users to apply filters, and even allow users to add tags to the pictures in groups. Google has confirmed to TechCrunch about the existence of the app but has termed it as one of the several experiments that the company is currently running. The California-based company is trying not to just create "yet another messaging app" but rather provide a collaborative experience to users while editing photos after sharing it with small group of friends, as per the report by TechCrunch. Even though many details about the app, including release timeline or its name, are currently not available, Google will reportedly be making use of its expertise in computer vision in the app to tag the objects in photos and organise them in order to find them with ease later on. The app is also said to allow users to apply filter to the images, a feature made popular by Snapchat but has been adopted by every social media platform now. One of the people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that the new app from Google will be a competitor to Path, a social media app that allows users to share and edit photos and videos with friends. The initial plans to announce the app were said to be for Google I/O in May but after the announcement of Clips by Apple these seem to have been changed, TechCrunch notes.

In the past several days, a slew of big brands have suspended their purchase of ads through YouTube and the Google Display Network, the tech giant’s network of third-party websites. How did ads wind up on videos made by terrorist sympathizers and other undesirable locations on the web? The graphic below explains (click to enlarge). Here are some key points to keep in mind: Ads are targeted at people, not specific websites or content When marketers or advertising agencies buy ads from Google and other online ad providers, those ads are typically targeted to people with certain interests or demographic profiles. In other words, they are buying a target audience, not space on particular websites. It is up to Google to target ads at the desired people. Even when ads appear on sites and videos marketers don’t want to be associated with, there’s every chance they’ve been delivered to people matching the desired profile. Policing the huge amount of content on Google is hard Google faces a big challenge in policing the quality and “brand-safety” of the vast array of content it places ads against, as WSJ’s Jack Nicas reports. The Google Display Network and DoubleClick Ad Exchange can each place ads across more than two million websites, and even more individual articles and webpages. Daily Newsletter Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ’s CMO Today newsletter. Sign up here. It’s a similar challenge with YouTube, which houses millions of videos that show ads. Google has policies in place its content partners must adhere to. But if they publish an article or video that breaches those policies, it’s not easy for Google to detect. (Recall that the lion’s share of Google’s revenue actually comes from its search advertising business.) Advertisers and Google want access to as much ad space as possible Most marketers would rather their ads didn’t appear alongside controversial content, but they also want to reach as many prospective customers as they possibly can. That’s partly why Google’s offerings have proved so appealing. Google, meanwhile, is incentivized to sell and place ads against as much content as possible because it generates revenue every time it does. It’s a tricky balance to strike, and some advertisers are more comfortable having their ads appear on controversial content than others. Google said it’s working to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear.

With premium features, elegant designs and also premium cost, it is said to be a successful device meeting user's demand. The Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL which was released in October 2016, have seen lots of positive comments in terms of its camera. The 12.3MP primary camera of this phone made use of Sony IMX378 sensor, and the 8MP front facing camera sports a Samsung S5K4H8/Omnivision OV8856 sensor in it. DxOMark called this camera as the "the best smartphone cameras ever made." Also Read: Pixel users can now rejoice, Google fixes Bluetooth connectivity issue Now, the software which used to make the most out of these sensors are said to be made originally for Google Glasses. This is the reason behind offering one of the best cameras by the Search Giant. Google Glass at the time of its release, made an interesting start by attracting photographers, doctors, porn industries and also casual users. But because of its camera which had a smaller sized sensor, it resulted in worse photography. Looking at this output, the Google engineers came up with other solution which was later known as Gcam. In the Gcam which looks similar to the HDR, the engineers worked on the image processing software to solve this sensor issue. That is, the solution involved here used a method called as image fusion which takes a rapid sequence of photos and then fuses them in order to create a better quality image.

Join For Free Discover how to focus on operators for Reactive Programming and how they are essential to react to data in your application.  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  Google has announced the availability of the initial developer preview release for its upcoming new major OS release – Android O (Rumored to be named “Oreo”). While this is only a developer preview and some of the included features in it can be pulled out in the future, and things can change – from a Dev perspective, this should be a perfect time to assess the implications such a release might have on your existing app quality, as well as the new opportunities underneath this major release. Before drilling into the Android O release content, let’s understand the current Android market landscape. As can be seen above, the latest Android N release is less than 3% market share with Samsung lead devices, and LG V20 is catching up with this version to perhaps drive that share toward the 5-7% soon. The major market grab is still thanks to Android M and L, that together account for ~60% of the Android market. Even though Google pushes through innovation in the market in an attempt to increase the adoption of its latest OS releases, there won’t be a significant revolution during 2017. That means fragmentation is still growing within the Android landscape. By fragmentation, it’s important to understand that this does not only mean more devices and OS combinations in the market to test against – it also means that from both supported features and test cases, there should be different branches that tie the test suites to a device/OS combination and a supported capability. It’s a Growing Problem As just one example, I took my personal Samsung Galaxy Note 5 – with its week-old Android N (7.0) OS upgrade – and tried leveraging a new feature that was introduced as part of that OS called App Shortcuts. Amazingly, when using this feature on the Twitter app, although it works great and allows me to write a new Tweet from the home screen by pressing on the app icon and selecting that menu option, when trying to interact with the Google Photos native app through the new app shortcuts, the app constantly crashes (see below screenshot). It is important to state that this feature works fine on that app on the Google Pixel (Android 7.1.1 OS) device. This is just one of many fragmentation problems from a testing perspective. Quite simply, there is a growing gap between test suite, app under test, and the target platforms under test. When considering the current market state and its constraints, let’s complicate things with what’s expected in Android O. Android O Capabilities: The Highlights App Background Limits: With the Android O release, developers can enforce more limits on the app resource usage to save battery and other HW device resources. This capability can allow an app based on pre-defined limits to better manage the device battery while in the background, through limits on the use of location services and signal activities. The impact of this new capability on the Dev and Test teams, assuming they are implementing that capability, is obviously more new tests and branching of these tests from Android < O releases. Within these new test cases, there will need to be tests to assure that there are limitations based on the location constraints set by the developers, and other limits that are supported. Notification Grouping: This new capability will allow users to group the notifications by types and to control which notification comes from which app, together with other criteria, so they can better manage the “noise” they receive. The impact of this feature would again be that more testing would need to be added to support the granular notifications that will be supported, as well as the configuration aspect on the device, and environment-related testing that will need to happen around the notification bar when other popups, notifications, and events occur. AutoFill API: This is a usability innovative feature that can allow users to set an “AutoFill” app that can support a specific need like password management, etc., without having the user launch that app in parallel. The impact of such features can vary based on the app context that is being developed since each app will have external needs and sometimes more than one (password management is only one example). Testers would need to understand which apps can serve as AutoFill for their AUT (app under test) and test against them. In that case, it will also make sense to leverage scenarios that were mentioned in bullet 2 like environments, system events, etc. Adaptive Icons: Here, developers can develop the app icons in ways that will look different based on the platform they are installed and launched on. This opens a range of visual-based test automation scenarios that will require a set of different devices with different resolutions and perhaps themes to assure that the dev animated icons look and move/adapt as expected. Bottom Line In this post, we examined a current market landscape that is already fragmented from both device and OS perspectives. That produces great challenges for Agile teams around test automation optimization. We touched on the upcoming Android O release and tried to identify some immediate insights and implications for current teams that develop and test Android native apps. We’ve left for another day the issue of Bluetooth audio quality enhancement, which is clearly another disruptive move in the mobile and mobile web space that both Dev and Test engineers ought to be ready for – leverage the early versions from Dev, EA, and Betas to be prepared for the launch. Are you ready? Learn how divergent branches can appear in your repository and how to better understand why they are called “branches".  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  Like This Article?

Sometimes the free app is a game for you to play, and other times it is a very useful productivity app. The current free iOS app of the week is a highly regarded video camera and editing app called Musemage. Downloading the app through Wednesday saves iOS users the $3.99 that the app usually costs. And while Android users might have been a wee-bit jealous, they no longer have a reason to feel that way. Google has now added a "Free App of the Week" section to the Google Play Store. Like the weekly iOS freebie, you never know what category the free app will be coming from until it is announced. Right now, the free app of the week for Android users is Cartoon Network's Card Wars-Adventure Time. Normally $2.99 from the Google Play Store, at the moment this app won't cost you a dime. Based on the animated cartoon with the same name, Card Wars-Adventure Time gives you the ability to "command an army of awesome warriors, including Husker Knights, Cool Dog, the Immortal Maize Walker, and even the Pig to destroy your opponent's forces! Place towers and cast spells to unleash ultimo attacks." The game allows you to customize your card deck for each opponent. Creatures, spells and towers can be leveled up, and you can merge them all together to become more powerful. Besides being offered for free to Android users, the game is available to those rockin' iOS. The latter though, will have to pay $3.99 for the app. Download Card Wars-Adventure Time. Simply click on the appropriate link (Android|iOS). Now that Android users have their own free app to download each week, we will be passing along the name of the freebie along with information about it and a link to make it easy for you to install it on your Android device.

By Tad Friend One approach to defeating aging suggests replacing body parts as they fail. Another aims at finding a master key to youth. Photograph by Grant Cornett for The New Yorker On a velvety March evening in Mandeville Canyon, high above the rest of Los Angeles, Norman Lear’s living room was jammed with powerful people eager to learn the secrets of longevity. When the symposium’s first speaker asked how many people there wanted to live to two hundred, if they could remain healthy, almost every hand went up. Understandably, then, the Moroccan phyllo chicken puffs weren’t going fast. The venture capitalists were keeping slim to maintain their imposing vitality, the scientists were keeping slim because they’d read—and in some cases done—the research on caloric restriction, and the Hollywood stars were keeping slim because of course. When Liz Blackburn, who won a Nobel Prize for her work in genetics, took questions, Goldie Hawn, regal on a comfy sofa, purred, “I have a question about the mitochondria. I’ve been told about a molecule called glutathione that helps the health of the cell?” Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant that protects cells and their mitochondria, which provide energy; some in Hollywood call it “the God molecule.” But taken in excess it can muffle a number of bodily repair mechanisms, leading to liver and kidney problems or even the rapid and potentially fatal sloughing of your skin. Blackburn gently suggested that a varied, healthy diet was best, and that no single molecule was the answer to the puzzle of aging. Yet the premise of the evening was that answers, and maybe even an encompassing solution, were just around the corner. The party was the kickoff event for the National Academy of Medicine’s Grand Challenge in Healthy Longevity, which will award at least twenty-five million dollars for breakthroughs in the field. Victor Dzau, the academy’s president, stood to acknowledge several of the scientists in the room. He praised their work with enzymes that help regulate aging; with teasing out genes that control life span in various dog breeds; and with a technique by which an old mouse is surgically connected to a young mouse, shares its blood, and within weeks becomes younger. Joon Yun, a doctor who runs a health-care hedge fund, announced that he and his wife had given the first two million dollars toward funding the challenge. “I have the idea that aging is plastic, that it’s encoded,” he said. “If something is encoded, you can crack the code.” To growing applause, he went on, “If you can crack the code, you can hack the code!” It’s a big ask: more than a hundred and fifty thousand people die every day, the majority of aging-related diseases. Yet Yun believes, he told me, that if we hack the code correctly, “thermodynamically, there should be no reason we can’t defer entropy indefinitely. We can end aging forever.” Nicole Shanahan, the founder of a patent-management business, announced that her company would oversee longevity-related patents that Yun had pledged to the cause. “I’m here with my darling, Sergey,” she said, referring to her boyfriend, Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google. “And he called me yesterday and said, ‘I’m reading this book, “Homo Deus,” and it says on page twenty-eight that I’m going to die.’ I said, ‘It says you, personally?’ He said, ‘Yes!’ ” (In the book, the author, Yuval Noah Harari, discusses Google’s anti-aging research, and writes that the company “probably won’t solve death in time to make Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin immortal.”) Brin, sitting a few feet away, gave the crowd a briskly ambiguous nod: Yes, I was singled out for death; no, I’m not actually planning to die. After Moby put in a plug for being vegan, Dzau called on Martine Rothblatt, the founder of a biotech firm called United Therapeutics, which intends to grow new organs from people’s DNA. “Clearly, it is possible, through technology, to make death optional,” Rothblatt said. (She has already commissioned a backup version of her wife, Bina—a “mindclone” robot named Bina48.) Aging has long lacked the kind of vocal constituency that raised awareness of H.I.V. and breast cancer; as a species, we stink at mobilizing against a deferred collective calamity (see: climate change). The old wax fatalistic, and the young don’t really believe they’ll grow old. But Rothblatt suggested that the evening marked an inflection point. Turning to Dzau, she declared, “It’s enormously gratifying to have the epitome of the establishment, the head of the National Academy of Medicine, say, ‘We, too, choose to make death optional!’ ” The gathering blazed with the conviction that such events can spark: the belief that those inside the room can determine the fate of all those outside the room. In the back, Andy Conrad picked up a mike to challenge the emphasis on extending maximum life span, which is currently around a hundred and fifteen. Conrad is the C.E.O. of Verily, a life-sciences firm owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet. Like most of the scientists in the room, he aims simply to help people enjoy a few more “quality-adjusted life years.” He asked, “Isn’t longevity a misnomer? Isn’t it ‘living longer well’? Or ‘healthspan’?” The biologists nodded with relief. “O.K., who overinflated the ball?” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon Norman Lear, still vigorous at ninety-four, closed the night by saying, “Seven years ago, I wrote a pilot script for a TV show called ‘Guess Who Died?,’ about people at a retirement community. I just learned today that it’s on its way to being made.” The audience demographics were catching up to him: by 2020, for the first time, there will be more people on Earth over the age of sixty-five than under the age of five. Lear continued, “So what I wish to offer you is, we have a stage now to get some of the things you’ve said tonight out to a national audience.” More applause: the message would spread! But which message? Death is optional? Or death will just have to wait? For decades, the solution to aging has seemed merely decades away. In the early nineties, research on C. elegans, a tiny nematode worm that resembles a fleck of lint, showed that a single gene mutation extended its life, and that another mutation blocked that extension. The idea that age could be manipulated by twiddling a few control knobs ignited a research boom, and soon various clinical indignities had increased the worm’s life span by a factor of ten and those of lab mice by a factor of two. The scientific consensus transformed. Age went from being a final stage (a Time cover from 1958: “Growing Old Usefully”) and a social issue (Time, 1970: “Growing Old in America: The Unwanted Generation”) to something avoidable (1996: “Forever Young”) or at least vastly deferrable (2015: “This Baby Could Live to Be 142 Years Old”). Death would no longer be a metaphysical problem, merely a technical one. The celebration was premature. Gordon Lithgow, a leading C. elegans researcher, told me, “At the beginning, we thought it would be simple—a clock!—but we’ve now found about five hundred and fifty genes in the worm that modulate life span. And I suspect that half of the twenty thousand genes in the worm’s genome are somehow involved.” That’s for a worm with only nine hundred and fifty-nine cells. The code book is far more complex for animals that excite our envy: the bee larva fed copiously on royal jelly that changes into an ageless queen; the Greenland shark that lives five hundred years and doesn’t get cancer; even the humble quahog clam, the kind used for chowder, which holds the record at five hundred and seven. For us, aging is the creeping and then catastrophic dysfunction of everything, all at once. Our mitochondria sputter, our endocrine system sags, our DNA snaps. Our sight and hearing and strength diminish, our arteries clog, our brains fog, and we falter, seize, and fail. Every research breakthrough, every announcement of a master key that we can turn to reverse all that, has been followed by setbacks and confusion. A few years ago, there was great excitement about telomeres, Liz Blackburn’s specialty—DNA buffers that protect the ends of chromosomes just as plastic tips protect the ends of shoelaces. As we age, our telomeres become shorter, and, when these shields go, cells stop dividing. (As Blackburn said, “It puts cells into a terribly alarmed state!”) If we could extend the telomeres, the thinking went, we might reverse aging. But it turns out that animals with long telomeres, such as lab mice, don’t necessarily have long lives—and that telomerase, the enzyme that promotes telomere growth, is also activated in the vast majority of cancer cells. The more we know about the body, the more we realize how little we know. Still, researchers plunge ahead. Understanding isn’t a precondition for successful intervention, they point out; we had no real grasp of virology or immunology when we began vaccinating people against smallpox. In the murk of scientific inquiry, every researcher looks to a ruling metaphor for guidance. Aubrey de Grey likes to compare the body to a car: a mechanic can fix an engine without necessarily understanding the physics of combustion, and assiduously restored antique cars run just fine. De Grey is the chief science officer of Silicon Valley’s SENS Research Foundation, which stands for Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence—a fancy way of saying “Planning Your Comprehensive Tune-up.” An Englishman who began his career with a decade of work in A.I., he speaks with rapid fluidity, often while stroking his Rasputin-length beard. De Grey has proposed that if we fix seven types of physical damage we will be on the path to living for more than a thousand years (assuming we can avoid getting hit by a bus or an asteroid). When I met him at the SENS office, in Mountain View, he told me, “Gerontologists have been led massively astray by looking for a root cause to aging, when it’s actually that everything falls apart at the same time, because all our systems are interrelated. So we have to divide and conquer.” We just need to restore tissue suppleness, replace cells that have stopped dividing and remove those that have grown toxic, avert the consequences of DNA mutations, and mop up the gunky by-products of all of the above. If we can disarm these killers, de Grey suggests, we should gain thirty years of healthy life, and during that period we’ll make enough further advances that we’ll begin growing biologically younger. We’ll achieve “longevity escape velocity.” De Grey vexes many in the life-extension community, and one reason may be his intemperate life style. He told me, “I can drink as much as I like and it has no effect. I don’t even need to exercise, I’m so well optimized.” Until recently, he maintained two girlfriends and a wife. Now, he said, “I’m engaged, and my polyamorous days are behind me.” “I’m sorry, but refusing to use an Oxford comma isn’t really grounds for divorce.” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon But the main reason is his prophetic air of certainty. His 2007 book, “Ending Aging,” is replete with both exacting research into the obstacles to living longer and proposed solutions so ambitious that they resemble science fiction. De Grey’s fix for mitochondrial mutation, for instance, is to smuggle backup copies of DNA from the mitochondria into the vault of the nucleus, which evolution annoyingly failed to do—probably because the proteins needed in the mitochondria would ball up during their journey through the watery cell body. His fix for that, moving the DNA one way and the proteins that it produces another, amounts to a kind of subcellular hokey pokey. A number of scientists praise de Grey for anatomizing the primary threats, yet they see troubleshooting all seven pathways through such schemes—and you have to troubleshoot them all for his plan to work—as a foredoomed labor. Matt Kaeberlein, a biogerontologist at the University of Washington, said, “It’s like saying, ‘All we have to do to travel to another solar system is these seven things: first, accelerate your rocket to three-quarters of the speed of light . . . ’ ” The great majority of longevity scientists are healthspanners, not immortalists. They want to give us a healthier life followed by “compressed morbidity”—a quick and painless death. These scientists focus on the time line: since 1900, the human life span has increased by thirty years—and so, as a consequence, have cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and dementia. Aging is the leading precondition for so many diseases that “aging” and “disease” are essentially metonyms. Accidents and violence are the leading causes of death up to age forty-four, then cancer rises to the top, and then, at sixty-five, heart disease. Healthspanners want to understand the etiologies of cancer and heart disease and then block them. Why do we almost never get those diseases at age two? How can we extend that protection to a hundred and two? But if we cured cancer we would add only 3.3 years to an average life; solving heart disease gets us an extra four. If we eliminated all disease, the average life span might extend into the nineties. To live longer, we’d have to slow aging itself. Even if we do that, the healthspanners believe, we’re not going to live forever—nor should we. They worry about the rapid drain on natural resources and on Social Security; the potential for a Stalin or a Mugabe to stay in power for centuries; the loss of new ideas from the young; and profound lifelong boredom. Amy Wagers, a researcher at Harvard, told me, “Part of the meaning of life is that we die.” The Greeks warned about the danger of grasping for godlike powers. It didn’t work out well for Asclepius or Achilles, and it worked out even worse for Tithonus, whose lover, Eos, begged Zeus to grant him eternal life but forgot to request eternal youth as well. Decrepit, senile, and miserable, Tithonus eventually shrank into a cicada who stridulated ceaselessly, calling out for release. When I met Ned David, I thought that he was about thirty. He had an unlined face and thick auburn hair, he walked rapidly with his hands stuffed into his jeans pockets, and he wore red Converse high-tops. David is forty-nine. He is a biochemist and a co-founder of a Silicon Valley startup called Unity Biotechnology. Unity targets senescent cells—cells that, as they age, start producing a colorless, odorless, noxious goo called SASP, which Unity’s researchers call “the zombie toxin,” because it makes other cells senescent and spreads chronic inflammation throughout the body. In mice, Unity’s treatments delay cancer, prevent cardiac hypertrophy, and increase median life span by thirty-five per cent. “We think our drugs vaporize a third of human diseases in the developed world,” David told me. David isn’t taking any of Unity’s drugs, which won’t be on the market for at least seven years. His youthfulness derives from existing therapies: he takes metformin—a diabetes drug that has made elderly diabetics live longer than a healthy control group—and Retin-A, for his skin. He also swims a lot, having quit running because of spinal osteoarthritis. “I am often accused, here, of picking the things we work on based on the problems of aging I have,” David said. “But because of our drugs I predict that I will run again!” A systemic approach to aging, which would ideally result in your general practitioner prescribing you a “God pill,” is philosophically attractive but financially infeasible. Pharma and biotech companies make money only if they treat a disease, and, because aging affects everything, the F.D.A. doesn’t recognize it as an “indication” susceptible to treatment (or to insurance-company reimbursement). So Unity is taking aim at glaucoma, macular degeneration, and arthritis; the fridge in its lab is stocked with human eyeballs and knee cartilage. This is the customary serial-specialist approach to aging, which tackles it symptom by symptom: let’s restore those eyes, then send you down the street for a 3-D-printed kidney. Last fall, Unity raised a hundred and sixteen million dollars from such investors as Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel, billionaires eager to stretch our lives, or at least their own, to a span that Thiel has pinpointed as “forever.” In a field rife with charlatans, Ned David’s Dorian Gray affect has factored into his fund-raising. “One class of investor, like Fidelity, finds my youthful appearance alarming,” he said. “Another class—the Silicon Valley type, a Peter Thiel—finds anyone who looks over forty alarming.” In mice, Unity Biotechnology’s treatments delay cancer, prevent cardiac hypertrophy, and increase median life span by thirty-five per cent. “We think our drugs vaporize a third of human diseases in the developed world,” one executive said. Photograph by Grant Cornett for The New Yorker Traditionally, it has been the graying tycoons of technology who funded aging research, hoping to disrupt the three-act structure of the Silicon Valley journey: life hacker, rock climber, cadaver. Now aging has cachet in the startup world. Arram Sabeti, the thirty-year-old founder of a tech company called ZeroCater, told me, “The proposition that we can live forever is obvious. It doesn’t violate the laws of physics, so we will achieve it.” Sabeti spends his leisure time reading all-cause-mortality metastudies, and is an investor in the Longevity Fund, a venture fund recently launched by Laura Deming. Deming, who is twenty-two, terms the longevity market a “two-hundred-billion-dollar-plus” opportunity, but she told me that “it’s really impossible to say how big it could be, because if you cured aging you’d change medicine entirely.” Unsurprisingly, it was Google that transformed the Valley’s view of aging. Surprisingly, perhaps, it was the company’s Bill Maris who was in the vanguard. As the founder and C.E.O. of Google Ventures, Maris led successful investments in companies such as Nest and Uber; he was amiable, admired, and financially secure—not an obvious modern-day alchemist. However, he told me, “My thoughts can turn to dark things when I’m alone.” His father died of a brain tumor in 2001, when Maris was twenty-six. “I majored in neuroscience, I’ve worked in hospitals, but until my father died I did not understand the finality of ‘Gone, never to be seen again,’ ” he said. Maris, who is forty-two, is a longtime vegetarian who works out on an elliptical machine for an hour every day. He comforts himself with the knowledge that the scientist who performed a 3-D scan of his brain praised his robust corpus callosum, the bundle of nerve fibers that connects the hemispheres. (Maris displays gleaming polymer models of his and his wife’s brains under glass bells in his office.) But such precautions and advantages were temporary, personal stopgaps. How could he fix the problem permanently, and for everyone? He decided to build a company that would solve death. He discussed the idea with Ray Kurzweil, the futurist who popularized the concept of the Singularity—the idea that humans will merge with A.I. and transcend our biological limitations—and Kurzweil was enthusiastic. Maris also discussed it with Andy Conrad, the geneticist who runs Alphabet’s Verily, and Conrad was thoughtfully discouraging. The first problem was the long study time in humans: it’s hard to run a clinical trial on subjects who take eighty years to die. (A related issue is that we have no accepted model for how to measure biological age, which often differs significantly from chronological age. Seventy probably isn’t the new fifty for, say, Ozzy Osbourne.) The second problem was the immense difficulty of determining whether any seeming cause of aging was actually causal, or merely a correlative of some other, stealthier process. “Andy did throw a lot of cold water on the idea,” Maris said. “But there were no issues of fact. He didn’t say, ‘Aging isn’t a genetic disease,’ or ‘Google will never fund this.’ ” In 2011, Maris pitched his proposed company to John Doerr, a prominent venture capitalist who is on Alphabet’s board. “Imagine you found a lamp on the beach, and a genie came out and granted you a wish,” Maris said. “If you were clever, your first wish would be for unlimited wishes.” As Doerr nodded, Maris continued, “Let’s say you’re going to live, at most, another thirty years.” Doerr had just turned sixty. “If each day is a wish, that’s only between one and ten thousand wishes. I don’t know about you, but I want to add more—I want to add wishes faster than they’re taken away.” Doerr, confronted with the limits to his life span, was galvanized. When Maris pitched Google’s founders, Sergey Brin, who has a gene variant that predisposes him to Parkinson’s disease, loved the idea, and Larry Page declared, “We should do it here!” In 2013, Google launched Calico, short for the California Life Company, with a billion dollars in funding. “Calico added a tremendous amount of validation to aging research,” George Vlasuk, the head of a biotech startup called Navitor, told me. “They have money, brainpower, and time.” But Calico has proved to be extremely secretive. All that’s known is that it’s tracking a thousand mice from birth to death to try to determine “biomarkers” of aging—biochemical substances whose levels predict morbidity; that it has a colony of naked mole rats, which live for thirty years and are amazingly ugly; and that it has invested in drugs that may prove helpful with diabetes and Alzheimer’s. (The company declined to comment.) A number of longevity scientists confess to disappointment with Calico’s direction. Nir Barzilai, a geneticist who is a leader in the aging field, told me, “The truth is, we don’t know what they’re doing, but whatever it is doesn’t really seem to be attacking the problem.” Another scientist who’s familiar with Calico’s workings said that it’s pursuing its mission judiciously, but that the company began, fatally, as a vanity project. The scientist said, “This is as self-serving as the Medici building a Renaissance chapel in Italy, but with a little extra Silicon Valley narcissism thrown in. It’s based on the frustration of many successful rich people that life is too short: ‘We have all this money, but we only get to live a normal life span.’ ” Maris, who has retired from Google Ventures, strongly disagreed with that view. “This is not about Silicon Valley billionaires living forever off the blood of young people,” he said. “It’s about a ‘Star Trek’ future where no one dies of preventable diseases, where life is fair.” “I’ll have whatever’s your most populist beer.” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon If Silicon Valley billionaires end up being sustained by young blood, they will satisfy an ancient yearning. In 1615, a German doctor suggested that “the hot and spirituous blood of a young man will pour into the old one as if it were from a fountain of youth.” In 1924, the physician and Bolshevik Alexander Bogdanov began young-blood transfusions, and a fellow-revolutionary wrote that he “seems to have become seven, no, ten years younger.” Then Bogdanov injected himself with blood from a student who had both malaria and tuberculosis, and died. Parabiosis, the surgical linkage of circulatory systems, has had a mostly grisly history in humans—when it was tried as a desperate measure on terminal cancer patients, in 1951, a two-year-old boy lost part of his foot to gangrene—and in rodents, which resisted being conjoined. A 1956 study warned, “If two rats are not adjusted to each other, one will chew the head of the other until it is destroyed.” We kept trying. In 2005, a Stanford lab, run by a stem-cell biologist and neurologist named Tom Rando, announced that heterochronic parabiosis, or an exchange of blood between older and younger mice, rejuvenated the livers and muscles of the older ones. Vampires everywhere felt validated. Last fall, on “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert warned teen-agers that President Trump would replace Obamacare with mandatory parabiosis: “He’s going to stick a straw in you like a Capri Sun.” Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists also had their straws poised. Rando said, “I’ve had a lot of meetings with young billionaires in Silicon Valley, and they all, to varying degrees, want to know when the secrets are coming out, both so they can get in on the next big thing and so they can personally take advantage of them. I say, ‘This is not an app. If you come at biology from a tech point of view, you’re going to be disappointed, because the pace is much slower.’ ” In recent years, the parabiosis field has grown quarrelsome. Is the rejuvenative key the presence of young-blood proteins, or the absence of something like SASP? Could it be a cellular by-product from one mouse, or the effect of borrowing a younger mouse’s liver? In 2014, the Harvard scientist Amy Wagers concluded that young-blood factors, particularly a protein called GDF11, gave older mice a stronger grip and renewed their brains. Most of her colleagues questioned her results, and the drug company Novartis promptly did a study that suggested the exact opposite: you should blockade GDF11. Wagers told me, “Different groups have reported that amounts of GDF11 go up, go down, or stay the same with age.” With a bleak laugh, she added, “Clearly, one group is right.” After Rando’s colleague Tony Wyss-Coray showed that young blood can foster new neurons in the hippocampus region of the brains of old mice, a company called Alkahest spun out from his work. Alkahest has begun to sift the more than ten thousand proteins in plasma, in hopes that the right protein cocktail can cure Alzheimer’s—a process that is expected to continue for more than a quarter century. When I visited Alkahest recently, Joe McCracken, the vice-president of business development, cued up side-by-side videos of genetically identical, equally aged mice. They were about to run a Barnes maze: a disk dotted with black circles, one of which was a hole—a laboratory version of a burrow in which to escape a diving hawk. During previous runs, they’d been trained to remember the hole’s location. McCracken, who was with two colleagues, explained that the first mouse had been treated only with a placebo of inert saline. We watched it nose here and there, uncertainly, before finally stumbling upon the hole. It took a minute and twenty seconds. The men clapped, releasing their anxiety. “It’s me in the parking lot, looking for my car,” Sam Jackson, the company’s chief medical officer, said. Then McCracken played the video of a mouse that had been tuned up with plasma from eighteen-year-old human beings. That mouse darted purposefully toward one sector of the maze, found the hole, and scooted into it in eighteen seconds. The execs grinned and shook their heads: youth. Every longevity experimenter has talismanic photos or videos of two mice: one timid and shuffling, with patchy fur; the other sleek and vital, thrumming with the miracle elixir. But can mice be our proxy? Empathy beguiles us into believing so. When you read that mice made to run on a treadmill were given “a five-minute warmup period and a five-minute cooldown period,” you think, Very sensible. Yet mice don’t have heart attacks, and their muscles start wasting suddenly, rather than gradually, as ours do. Mice also don’t get Alzheimer’s disease, so scientists mimic it by breeding mice with genes taken from humans. But, since we get Alzheimer’s only when we’re old, testing treatments in young mice often proves misleading. It doesn’t help that labs use radiation to cause artificial aging, or that lab mice live much longer than wild mice. Tony Wyss-Coray told me, “People say, ‘The young mouse finds the hole—O.K., we’re good, give me the treatment!’ And I say, ‘We don’t know if it’s safe, we don’t know if mice are the same as humans—you have to wait.’ ” We’ve cured cancer in lab mice dozens of times, and made them live twice as long, yet none of those results have transferred upstream. “So many times, the mice have failed us,” the geneticist Nir Barzilai lamented. “I love the smell of diesel in the morning.” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon The reigning view among longevity scientists is that aging is a product not of evolutionary intent but of evolutionary neglect: we are designed to live long enough to pass on our genes, and what happens afterward doesn’t much matter. As the geroscientist Richard A. Miller wrote, “Mice that devote their energies to eating and breeding will do better than those that spend valuable capital on eye repair and anticancer surveillance.” We mature more slowly than mice and live much longer, because we, like whales and naked mole rats, are at much less risk of being eaten in our first year. Yet from the age of thirty or forty on, after we’ve spawned, we’re living on time that evolution regards as pointless. Eric Verdin, the C.E.O. of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the leading nonprofit in the field, noted that “if you just kept aging at the rate you age between twenty and thirty, you’d live to a thousand. At thirty, everything starts to change.” From that point, our risk of mortality doubles every seven years. We’re like salmon, only we die in slow motion. The battle between healthspanners and immortalists is essentially a contest between the power of evolution as ordained by nature and the potential power of evolution as directed by man. The healthspanners see us as subject to linear progress: animal studies take the time that they take; life sciences move at the speed of life. Noting that median life expectancy has been increasing in developed nations by about two and a half years a decade, Verdin told me, “If we can keep that pace up for the next two hundred years, and increase our life spans by forty years, that would be incredible.” The immortalists have a different view of both our history and our potential. They see centuries of wild theorizing (that aging could be reversed by heating the body, or by breathing the same air as young virgins) swiftly replaced by computer-designed drugs and gene therapies. Bill Maris said, “Health technology, which for five thousand years was symptomatic and episodic—‘Here are some leeches!’—is becoming an information technology, where we can read and edit our own genomes.” Many immortalists view aging not as a biological process but as a physical one: entropy demolishing a machine. And, if it’s a machine, couldn’t it be like a computer? Progress in computers, or anyway in semiconductors, has been subject to Moore’s Law, the exponential flywheel that has doubled capacity every two years. In linear progress, after thirty iterations you’ve advanced thirty steps; in exponential progress, you’ve advanced 1.07 billion steps. Our progress in mapping the human genome looked like it was linear—and then was revealed, once the doublings grew significant, as exponential. A number of startups are trying to harness exponential curves. BioAge has been using machine learning and crunching genomics data to search for biomarkers that predict mortality. Kristen Fortney, the company’s thirty-four-year-old C.E.O., told me that she had also begun testing computationally designed drugs to find an unexpected substance that would powerfully affect those markers. She’s about to seek her next round of venture financing, and she’s optimistic: “Biotech is something a lot of V.C.s don’t understand, but machine learning and big data are things they do understand.” Aging doesn’t seem to be a program so much as a set of rules about how we fail. Yet the conviction that it must be a program is hard to dislodge from Silicon Valley’s algorithmic minds. If it is, then reversing aging would be a mere matter of locating and troubleshooting a recursive loop of code. After all, researchers at Columbia University announced in March that they’d stored an entire computer operating system (as well as a fifty-dollar Amazon gift card) on a strand of DNA. If DNA is just a big Dropbox for all the back-office paperwork that sustains life, how hard can it be to bug-fix? In July, Brian Hanley, a sixty-year-old microbiologist who lives in Davis, California, began trying to give himself the equivalent of an operating-system update: he injected analogues of the gene for growth-hormone-releasing hormone, or GHRH, into his left thigh. GHRH is normally produced in the brain, but Hanley was essentially turning a pencil-eraser-size part of his thigh into a gland that made the molecule, which stimulates the heart, the kidneys, and the thymus. He believed that the treatment was working. His testosterone and good cholesterol were up, his heart rate and bad cholesterol were down, his eyesight was keener. And there was a peculiar side effect: euphoria. On one bike ride, when his bike began to topple sideways, he just let it take him down, laughing. When I met with him, though, he moved gingerly around his dining-room table, unable to sit for long. A few days earlier, he’d herniated a disk trying to lift a refrigerator. It was his fourth significant injury since beginning his gene therapy, but he assured me that this was a common problem for people taking a course of regenerative medicine: they feel so good that they try to do too much. When George Church, a Harvard geneticist whose lab collaborates with Hanley, heard about his injuries, he told me, “It sounds like it affected his mind more than his muscles.” For those frustrated by the stately progress of research up the animal chain, from worms to flies to mice to dogs to monkeys, speculative treatments abound. In Monterey, California, a clinic will give you young plasma for eight thousand dollars a pop—but you have no idea what it’s doing to you. Peter Nygård, a leonine seventy-five-year-old Finnish-Canadian clothing designer who got rich making women look slim in modestly priced pants, has had injections with stem cells derived from his DNA. He believes that the process has reversed his aging. In an interview a few years ago, he proclaimed, “I’m the only guy in the world today who has me, in a petri dish, before I was born.” Researchers store vials of aging cells in liquid nitrogen for use in future experiments. If work progresses slowly, some also plan to freeze themselves, with instructions to reawaken them once science has finished paving the way to immortality. Photograph by Grant Cornett for The New Yorker While Hanley has a tinkerer’s mentality—there’s a hyperbaric chamber stuffed behind his couch—he’s a dedicated researcher. Since the F.D.A. requires an authorization for any new tests on humans, he began trying therapies on himself. He’d read the literature on self-experimentation, and tallied the results: eight deaths (including that of the blood-transfusing Alexander Bogdanov), and ten Nobel Prizes. Coin toss. Hanley acknowledged that his research had a few basic problems as a template for reshaping life spans. First, a sample size of one; second, a therapeutic method whose results may not last; third, a gene whose effects seem to be regenerative rather than transformative. In order to comprehensively reprogram ourselves, we’d want to insert corrective genes into a virus that would disperse them throughout the body, but doing so could alarm the immune system. The advent of CRISPR, a gene-editing tool, has given researchers confidence that we’re on the verge of the gene-therapy era. George Church and his Harvard postdocs have culled forty-five promising gene variants, not only from “super centenarians”—humans who’ve lived to a hundred and ten—but also from yeast, worms, flies, and long-lived animals. Yet Church noted that even identifying longevity genes is immensely difficult: “The problem is that the bowhead whale or the capuchin monkey or the naked mole rat, species that live a lot longer than their close relatives, aren’t that close, genetically, to those relatives—a distance of tens of millions of genetic base pairs.” The molecular geneticist Jan Vijg said, “You can’t just copy a single mechanism from the tortoise,” which can live nearly two hundred years. “We’d have to turn our genome over to the tortoise—and then we’d be a tortoise.” Becoming part tortoise wouldn’t necessarily alarm Brian Hanley. If we can only find the right genes and make their viral transmission safe, he declared, “we can enable human transformations that would rival Marvel Comics. Super muscularity, ultra-endurance, super radiation-resistance. You could have people living on the moons of Jupiter who’d be modified in this way, and they could physically harvest energy from the gamma rays they were exposed to.” Although Ned David has maintained his milk-fed aspect by battling his own aging on multiple fronts, down to his choice of sneakers, he can’t shake the idea that our foe is fundamentally unitary. David likens longevity research to a huge tree, and he believes that most current efforts, including the therapies his company is pursuing, are just branches of the tree. “No one is working on the trunk,” he told me, mournfully. In December, however, he began to have hope that “trunkness,” as he puts it, was in sight. David had long suspected that the epigenome was central to longevity. If the genome is our cellular hardware, then the epigenome is its software: it’s the code that activates DNA, telling a cell to differentiate—to become a macrophage or a neuron—and then how to remember its identity. The epigenome itself is controlled by agents that add or subtract chemical groups, known as marks, to its proteins. Biologists suspect that when the epigenome accumulates too many marks, over time, the signals it sends to cells change dramatically—and that those new signals produce the effects of aging. This process could explain, for instance, why an old person’s skin can refresh itself with new cells every month and yet continue to look old. In 2012, Tom Rando and his Stanford colleague Howard Chang published a paper noting that a fertilized human egg has properties of eternal youth: sperm and eggs can age, but every embryo resets the clock. Chang, a dermatologist and genome scientist, had discovered that the epigenome in aging skin, once it has accumulated enough marks, turns the genome on with a protein called NF-kB in ways that inflame and age skin. When he inhibited NF-kB in genetically modified mice, it rejuvenated their skin. Rando’s work in parabiosis seemed to hinge on a similar process: making stem cells revert to a more youthful stage. The scientists suggested that “the ideal would be to reset the aging clock but to leave the differentiation program untouched”—that is, to engage the stem cells and make them refresh tissues and organs without making them revert to a predifferentiated state, which would introduce hairy, tooth-filled tumors called teratomas. The goal was young-Brad-Pitt-stage Benjamin Button, nothing more. After that paper, Rando turned back to parabiosis, and Chang began work on a cream to make skin look decades younger. He explained, “That’s what people want.” But he also said that the longevity community had proved too fractious: “It’s the most difficult field I’ve ever worked in, and I didn’t want to define my scientific life with all these fights.” In December, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, of the Salk Institute, in San Diego, announced that he’d done the work that Rando and Chang had proposed. After four years of trial and error in mouse experiments, he had figured out a way to trigger the Yamanaka factors, four genes that reset the clock in fertilized eggs. When lab mice drank water laced with doxycycline—but only two days a week—they lived more than thirty per cent longer. Wild mice subjected to the same method had rejuvenated muscles and pancreases. “That’s one more reason not to like him.” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon As in most modern efforts to circumvent aging, Belmonte was tricking the body—borrowing a powerful mechanism from embryos and, very gingerly, applying it to adults. He told me, “You want a cardiac cell to become a new cardiac cell, but not to revert all the way to a stem cell, which would stop the heart beating. We did that. Our experiment was very rude and uncontrollable, and there will be other deleterious effects, as well as many unknowns. But this is very promising.” Modifying cells’ software was less dangerous than tampering with their hardware, he said, and, as with software, “there will always be a better version of our program next year.” Belmonte was careful to downplay the obvious question that his research provoked: If we could keep resetting our clock, couldn’t we live indefinitely? “The idea is not to increase life span but to have yourself working better,” he told me. He chuckled, and added, “Obviously, if you improve all the cells in your body, as an indirect consequence you will live longer.” Galvanized by Belmonte’s work, Ned David flew to San Diego twice this winter to meet with him and see if there was a way “to prove that this was the ticking clock” and then to “nudge us back to twenty-five-ness.” In mid-March, they discussed ways to proceed. Could they develop markers so that cells would change color in the lab if a drug made them younger—and change to a different color if they were perturbed too far? Could the team activate telomerase to rejuvenate the epigenome? Could they find genes that would act as an emergency brake on the reversion process? There was so much systems logic to think through. David was tantalized by the possibility of trunkness, yet still unsure. “We can revert some tissues, in a shotgunny way,” he said, “but we haven’t figured out the Francis Crick experiment that changes everything.” He laughed. “If I knew what that experiment was, I’d be doing it now.” Even if Belmonte and David find a substance that rejuvenates stem cells the perfect, Goldilocks amount, there will likely be unexpected side effects—for the hip bone is connected not only to the thigh bone but to every other damn bone. To repair tissue, you need to rejuvenate stem cells. But stem cells need to divide to do their job, and the division process invites random mutations—which drive cancer. A great many longevity papers end with mystified hand-waving in the direction of unknown “systemic factors.” Solving aging is not just a whodunnit but a howdunnit and wheredunnit and a whyohwhydunnit. Tom Rando suggested, “It’s not A causes B causes C causes D causes aging. It’s a network diagram of nodes and links—all subject to feedback loops where consequences become causes—that gradually becomes more and more destabilized.” If the body is a set of Christmas-tree lights—and it’s not—then every time you plug it into a new outlet some lights go on and some go off. Stabilizing one part of the network further destabilizes another. That which makes us also unmakes us, and the process of living seems inextricably bound to the process of dying. So far, the most powerful interventions you can make to extend your life are the kinds of low-tech things that your doctor has already told you in a droning voice. Quit smoking (ten more years) and wear a seat belt (two more). Assuming you’ve already done that, exercise regularly and watch your diet. Pankaj Kapahi, a researcher at the Buck Institute, recently showed me two clear boxes filled with fruit flies in vials, with two types of food at the bottom: orange goo in one set of vials and yellow goo in the other. “These are the flies on the burger diet, these are the flies on the Spartan diet,” he said, pointing to the boxes. “You can gauge their health by how quickly they go up the vial.” He banged both boxes, hard. The burger-fed flies struggled upward, while the Spartan flies soared. “Some of these diets can double their life spans,” he said. Both caloric restriction and exercise appear to dampen mTOR, a signalling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism. Under strain, the body realizes that it’s a bad time to reproduce and a good time to repair cells and increase stress resistance. Scientists believe this is nature’s way of responding to famine: hunker down and wait for better times to procreate. There seems to be a link between forgoing sex and extending life, since what the French call the little death apparently hastens the big one. The immune suppressant rapamycin makes mice live longer, yet shrivels their testicles. Likewise, the most proven way for a man to live fourteen years longer than average is to become a eunuch. Good news/bad news. Starving yourself, unsurprisingly, has disadvantages. If you want caloric restriction to have a chance of working, you should take in at least thirty per cent fewer calories, and the most useful way to do that—intermittent fasting—is both unpleasant for subjects to endure and impossible for researchers to patent. So the goal is to develop powerful drugs that subdue mTOR without making you feel famished. In the meantime, the Calorie Restriction Society’s Web site warns you to be careful how you go about limiting your intake: “Sudden adult onset calorie restriction shortens the lifespans of mice.” The site goes on to say, “There are several other risks you should be aware of”—at which point the page breaks off. October 12, 2015 Share Tweet Buy a cartoon Leonard Guarente, an M.I.T. biology professor who did important research on the mTOR-regulating enzymes called sirtuins—which seemed like a potential master key a decade ago—is a co-founder and the chief scientist of Elysium Health. Elysium’s first nutraceutical product, called Basis, promises “metabolic repair and optimization.” For fifty dollars a month, a daily pill provides you with chemicals that nourish sirtuins. There are no clinical data yet that Basis does anything useful in humans, so, when I visited Guarente in his office at M.I.T., I asked if he’d noticed any effects from taking it. “I have,” he said. He glanced at Elysium’s P.R. person. “Can I say it? It is O.K.?” She gave a calibrated nod, and he said, “My fingernails grow faster.” And what does that mean? “I don’t know. But something.” All the leading immortalists started out in tech, and all had a father who died young (as Ray Kurzweil’s did when he was twenty-two), or absconded early (as Aubrey de Grey’s did before he was born). They share an early loss of innocence and a profound faith that the human mind can perfect even the human body. Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, lost his adoptive mother to cancer when he was in college—and later donated three hundred and seventy million dollars to aging research. “Death has never made any sense to me,” he told a biographer. “How can a person be there and then just vanish?” Bill Maris, who conceived of Calico, said that, when he pondered the inevitability of death, “I felt it was maybe our mission here to transcend that, and to preserve consciousness indefinitely.” Immortalists fall into two camps. Those who might be called the Meat Puppets, led by de Grey, believe that we can retool our biology and remain in our bodies. The RoboCops, led by Kurzweil, believe that we’ll eventually merge with mechanical bodies and/or with the cloud. Kurzweil is a lifelong fixer and optimizer: early in his career, he invented the flatbed scanner and a machine that reads books aloud to the blind. Those inventions have improved dramatically in subsequent iterations, and now he’s positive that what he calls “the law of accelerating returns” for human longevity is about to kick in. I met with Kurzweil at Google, where he is a director of engineering, but he emphasized that he was speaking in his private capacity as a futurist. Though a few days short of his sixty-ninth birthday, he looked much younger. After discovering, in his thirties, that he had Type 2 diabetes, he changed his life style radically and began taking supplements. He swallows some ninety pills a day, including metformin; Basis; a coenzyme called Q10, for muscle strength; and phosphatidylcholine, to keep his skin supple. “How does it look?” he asked me, plucking at his forearm. “Supple!” I said. Kurzweil thinks of such efforts, which attempt to slow aging by using current technology, as Bridge One to indefinite longevity. But he also subscribes to the belief that the body is essentially a computer made up of overwritable data and updatable apps. Therefore, we’ll soon be in the midst of a biotech revolution, which will offer personally tailored immune therapies for cancer as well as organs grown from our own DNA. This is Bridge Two, which he believes will bring us to longevity escape velocity within about fifteen years. “I’m actually a little more optimistic than Aubrey,” he said. Bridge Three, which he expects us to cross by the two-thousand-thirties, is nanobots—blood-cell-size devices that will roam the body and the brain, cleaning up all the damage that de Grey wants to fix with medical interventions. “I used to call it the killer app of health technology,” Kurzweil said, “but that’s not a good name.” When we cross Bridge Four, those same nanobots will connect our brains to a neocortical annex in the cloud, and our intelligence will quickly expand a billionfold. Once that transformation happens, in 2045, the Singularity occurs and we become like gods. “For a time, we’ll be a hybrid of biological and nonbiological thinking, but, as the cloud keeps doubling, the nonbiological intelligence will predominate,” Kurzweil said. “And it will be anachronistic, then, to have one body.” He raised his arms slightly and squinted at them, a carpenter troubled by a burl in the wood. Kurzweil acknowledges that he was profoundly affected by the early death of his father, Fredric. Fredric was a brilliant conductor and pianist, but he worked incessantly to make ends meet and was often absent from the family. Kurzweil’s mother once observed, “It was hard on Raymond. He needed a father—and his father was never around.” Kurzweil has preserved fifty boxes of his father’s effects, everything from his letters and photographs to his electric bills, all pack-ratted into a storage facility in Newton, Massachusetts. He hopes to someday create a virtual avatar of his father and then populate the doppelgänger’s mind with all this information, as well as with his own memories of and dreams about his father, exhuming a Fredric Kurzweil 2.0. “We have spent millennia rationalizing the tragedy of death—‘Oh, it’s natural, it’s the goal of life,’ ” Kurzweil told me. “But that’s not really how we feel when we hear that someone we love has died.” He fell silent, then reverted to the question of how realistic his father’s avatar would be, how consoling. “Passing a Fredric Kurzweil Turing test is getting easier and easier,” he said, smiling wryly, “because the people who knew him, like me, are getting older and older.” March 24, 2014 Share Tweet Buy a cartoon The Meat Puppets, fighting off old age, must contend with evolutionary contingency. Jan Vijg, who co-authored a recent paper arguing that our life span is basically capped at a hundred and fifteen, told me, “Yes, our bodies are information-processing systems. But to fix the body-as-computer requires an in-depth understanding of what’s going on in your cells at a molecular level. And we don’t even know how many types of cells there are! Creating a human is not nearly as easy as creating an A.I., because we’re so very confusingly and unintelligently designed by random changes acted upon by natural selection.” The RoboCops must contend with the boundaries of the human terrain. Osman Kibar, the C.E.O. of a biotech company called Samumed, told me, “We humans are very creative. When we hit a biological limit, we cheat—like Kurzweil, who’s saying, ‘Let’s change the definition of human.’ As each of our functions is uploaded or replaced, at some point you stop calling that a human and start calling it an A.I.” We already have technologies that work inside the body, such as pacemakers and cochlear implants. A paralyzed man recently typed eight words a minute by using a brain-computer interface inserted in his motor cortex. How long will it be before the advantages of scaling and precision manufacture can be applied to the whole body? The 2045 Institute, started by a wealthy Russian inspired by Kurzweil’s time line, believes that we can at least begin making down payments on that moment. The institute’s Web site has an “immortality button,” which you click “to start the development of your own personalized immortal avatar.” You can select from among a remote-controlled robotic copy, a full-body prosthesis topped off by your transplanted head, and a top-of-the-line, wholly artificial body containing your uploaded essence, which will “achieve perfection of form and be no less attractive than the human body.” The sticking point seems to be what to do about our heads, specifically our brains. The futurist Juan Enriquez told me, “We’ll be able to transplant a mouse head within five years. And then it gets really interesting—does Mickey remember Minnie?” At the moment, however, no one has figured out how to refresh Mickey’s brain biology, no matter which body it’s attached to. Neurons don’t regenerate, and we don’t grow new ones, except in the hippocampus. Stem cells imported into the brain don’t help; they just sit there, then die. Benjamin Rapoport, a neurosurgery resident at Weill Cornell Brain and Spine Center who’s working on a project that would directly connect brains to A.I.s, said, “The question is, What is the fundamental you that is you? Most people feel it’s the mind. But can your mind exist only in a biological substrate that weighs 1.5 kilograms, is very wet, and floats like a jellyfish? Or could it conceivably exist someplace else?” In a computer, say. A two-way, high-bandwidth interface with the brain could be available within a decade, and scientists are already trying to map the hundred billion neurons in the brain and the hundred-trillion-plus connections between them—the “connectome,” as it’s infelicitously called. Currently, you can model someone’s brain at the synapse level only by slicing it up after the person is dead. Eventually, however, it seems possible that we could achieve “whole-brain emulation” with live subjects. There would then be permanent copies of our brains that would—we hope—themselves have consciousness. But would that be us? Even if you set aside the question of what portion of being human is somatic—of how much our identity derives from the tactile and sensory and emotional consequences of being embodied in flesh, rather than in Row D of a server farm—you can’t dispense with the problem of memory. Unlike the RAM in a computer, human memories emerge from electrochemical inputs, which trigger your brain to match a pattern and produce an output. There is no physical location for your memory of a first kiss. The recollection changes with the stimulus that triggers it, depending on whether you recall the kiss the next day, read about it in a letter, or run into that old girlfriend twenty years later. So if the connectome project works, and we’re transferred to silicon, we might be invulnerable to physical decay and capable of astounding feats of learning and ratiocination, yet shorn of that first memory of crocuses in a spring rain. But maybe we’d have no memory of caring. Ray Kurzweil and Aubrey de Grey have the same backup plan if the work doesn’t advance as quickly as they expect: when they die, they will be frozen in liquid nitrogen, with instructions left to reawaken them once science has finished paving the road to immortality. Their optimism is admirable, and perhaps the anxieties that their blueprints stir up are just the standard resentments of the late adopters and the left-behinds. “People are daunted when they hear of these things,” Kurzweil told me. “Then they say, ‘I don’t know if I want to live that long.’ ” For Kurzweil, who has two children, the acceptance of inevitable death is no saner than the acceptance of early death. “It’s a common philosophical position that death gives meaning to life, but death is a great robber of meaning,” he said. “It robs us of love. It is a complete loss of ourselves. It is a tragedy.” “I’m in not publishing.”November 7, 2011 Share Tweet Buy a cartoon And yet. Last year, the geneticist Nir Barzilai hosted a screening of a documentary about longevity, and afterward he posed a question to the three hundred people in the audience. He told me, “I said, ‘In nature, longevity and reproduction are exchangeable. So Choice One is, you are immortalized, but there is no more reproduction on Earth, no pregnancy, no first birthday, no first love’—and I go on and on and on.” He laughed, amused by his own determination to load the dice. “ ‘Choice Two,’ I said, ‘is you live to be eighty-five and not one day sick, everything healthy and fine, and then one morning you just don’t wake up.” The vote was decisive, he said. “Choice One got ten or fifteen people. Everyone else raised their hands for Choice Two.” This wish to preserve life as we know it, even at the cost of dying, is profoundly human. We are encoded with the belief that death is the mother of beauty. And we are encoded, too, with the contradictory determination to remain exactly as we are, forever—or at least for just a bit longer, before we have to go. ♦ Tad Friend has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998.

Photo: Reuters /Lucy Nicholson When a Google executive apologized to advertisers last week in London, the apology echoed seven time zones away in Vietnam. As with their counterparts in Britain, Vietnamese and multinational companies have recently yanked ads from YouTube that were attached to clips deemed by authorities as offensive.  The difference in the Southeast Asian country is that advertisers are getting pushed to withhold their advertising by government officials in Hanoi. Matt Brittin, Google’s chief in Europe, apologized on March 13 because advertisements for major international brands had run alongside videos of extremist materials, including hate speech from white nationalist groups.  But in the case of Vietnam, commercials have appeared with videos that were merely critical of Vietnam’s one-party state. Toxic: Vietnam tightly censors the internet for anti-state content. Photo: Reuters  The situations on opposite sides of the planet would seem on the surface unrelated, except that they both resulted from YouTube’s computer algorithm that pairs ads with perceived as relevant user uploads. In the context of Vietnam’s closed political system, dominated by the ruling Communist Party, the controversial videos appeared to have been uploaded by dissidents abroad. The state’s censorship requests and companies’ agreement to oblige entail significant reputational risks for multinational corporations with operations in Vietnam’s fast growing economy.  Earlier this month, Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communication summoned major local and foreign companies to its office and told them to ask YouTube owner Google, as well as Facebook, for a way to control against objectionable content. Officials urged advertisers to boycott YouTube until it deletes clips that they believe defame, oppose, and tell lies about the state. Businesses including Ford, Unilever and Yamaha Motors complied with the government’s request, according to reports. Under pressure: Google’s signage at its New York offices in 2013. Photo: Reuters/Andrew Kelly “This really is a worrisome risk, affecting the safety and prestige of brands,” the ministry said in a web posting dated March 16, right after a meeting with corporate representatives from Vinamilk, Sun Group, Unilever Vietnam and others. A day later YouTube said it had “carefully reviewed” Hanoi’s takedown requests. “Although we do not comment on specific videos, we continue to work with the government of Vietnam, and are always available to address any questions or issues the government is concerned about,” YouTube said in a statement emailed to reporters. Vietnam was one of YouTube’s 10 fastest growing global markets in 2015. YouTube blocked 42 uploads out of 8,000 requested by Vietnamese authorities, according to the information ministry’s official newspaper, VietNamNet. Ministry official Le Quang Tu Do clarified on Friday that it had submitted a list of 2,200 clips to Youtube for deletion, with the 5,800 others were still being classified by ministry officials, according to state media reports. Blocked: Vietnam is home to one of the most restricted medias in Asia. Photo: Reuters /Nguyen Lan Thang  The Google-owned video-sharing platform, however, said it had received fewer than 50 official takedown requests. In an earlier statement, YouTube included a reminder that many advertisers don’t choose which videos show their advertisements, which is often decided automatically by a computer program. The information ministry, in its push to steer marketing away from the website, said it recently found many ads “embedded in videos with content that is bad, toxic, and in violation of Vietnamese laws.” The state monopolizes and controls most media in Vietnam and has jailed several independent bloggers and dissidents for critical social media posts on anti-state charges, including a provision that makes “propagandizing” against the state punishable by 20-years in prison. One local economist said he does not expect Vietnam will resort to stopping its 92 million citizens from watching YouTube videos altogether, thanks to a mix of technical capacity and political will. In recent years, the country also has backed away from its sporadic blocks of Facebook, which many Vietnamese bloggers use as their social media platform of choice. In neighboring China, both websites are harder to access. Jailed: Convicted Vietnamese bloggers Nguyen Huu Vinh (C) and Nguyen Thi Minh in court on September 22, 2016, Photo: AFP/ Vietnam News Agency  Marc Townsend, managing director of CBRE Vietnam, a multinational property company, said the government’s pressure puts businesses in a tough spot. While free speech matters, Townsend said, firms also need to worry about corporate compliance, as well as find a way to work with ministries that control their licensing and other business issues. “Most of us don’t own our own companies,” he said. “We have a responsibility to our shareholders, to our clients.” While YouTube did not offer a public statement on the matter, it instead pointed local reporters to a statement from the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), an industry association of multinational technology companies that includes Facebook and Google. “The Vietnamese economy benefits greatly from the internet – from lowering barriers to entry for entrepreneurs and [small businesses], to providing access to global markets for Vietnamese goods and services,” AIC managing director Jeff Paine said. “The internet’s ability to deliver growth dividends and benefit Vietnamese businesses and people, depend on it remaining open and allowing information and services to flow freely and safely across borders.” The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Share Tweet Linkedin Email Southeast Asia Censorship Vietnam Google YouTube Social Media Reputation Risk Comments More on this topic Confusion as Pinterest blocked in China Asia Unhedged Breaking a taboo, Hanoi recalls war with China Xuan Loc Doan Fake news fuels Indonesian intolerance Yuli Ismartono EVEN MORE asia times Facebook Twitter Google plus Linkedin asia times Facebook Twitter Google plus Linkedin Explore Main China Northeast Asia Insights Southeast Asia World Politics Business Culture Trending Topics #South Asia #Japan #Middle East #India #Koreas #South China Sea #Hong Kong About About Asia Times Contact Us Advertise with Us Write for Us Terms of Use Privacy The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox © 2017 Asia Times Holdings Limited, All Rights Reserved.

This was the case in Tempe, Arizona, on Friday, when an Uber self-driving car was hit so hard that it rolled onto its side. There were no serious injuries reported. Uber has grounded its fleet of self-driving cars in Arizona as a result, a spokeswoman for the company told me. “We are continuing to look into this incident, and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement provided to The Atlantic. Uber also suspended testing of its self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh and San Francisco “for the day, and possibly longer,” The New York Times reported. In addition to its global ride-hailing service, Uber has been testing its self-driving car technology on public roads in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and California for several months. The vehicle involved in the Arizona crash was in autonomous mode at the time of the collision—meaning the car was driving itself with a human riding behind the wheel—but police in Tempe say Uber wasn’t to blame for what happened. A human-driven vehicle failed to yield at a traffic signal, and collided with the Uber SUV, police said in local news reports. The incident is a reminder of the need for this technology in the first place: Humans are abysmally bad drivers. But it’s also a reminder of how much Uber has riding on the success of self-driving cars. And how much is that? Everything, basically. If self-driving cars are adopted on a mass scale and Uber isn’t leading the way, its current business—which revolves around humans driving cars—is made obsolete. But if Uber finds a way to dominate in the development of self-driving cars, it can remove those costly human drivers from its business model—a scenario that could mean a windfall for Uber. Succeeding on this front “is basically existential for us,” Uber’s CEO, Travis Kalanick, told Bloomberg Businessweek in August. Related Stories Uber’s Secret Program Raises Questions About Discrimination What Happens If Uber Fails? As Uber Melts Down, Its CEO Says He 'Must Fundamentally Change' The ride-sharing company is uniquely positioned in the self-driving car space this way. Google’s self-driving car project, now rebranded as Waymo, could fail and its parent company would still have a massively profitable search engine to fall back on. “Every other company isn’t betting the company’s future on self-driving cars,” said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Google will be fine. Uber is the one company in the world who has really made this all-or-nothing bet.” The crash in Tempe is unlikely to derail Uber’s self-driving car aspirations—especially if the incident played out the way law enforcement described, and Uber was not at fault. But Uber is facing several other major problems. For one, there’s the federal lawsuit. Waymo is suing Uber for intellectual property theft, claiming that an Uber engineer who used to work for Google stole 10 gigabytes of “highly confidential data” from Google’s servers, then used it to copy Google’s designs for a self-driving car. The lawsuit is a “particularly damaging development for Uber,” given how much is at stake, Sundararajan told me. There are also reports of internal strife on Uber’s self-driving car team, which has escalated into a “mini civil war,” according to the tech-news site Recode. Leaders from Uber’s self-driving car unit gathered in San Francisco for a “critical summit” on the matter last week, hoping to solve leadership problems and figure out a way to stem departures from the embattled company. “With every engineer that defects,” Recode wrote, “Uber is feeding the fire of its competitors, which are growing by the day, both big and small.” “Uber has tied their fortunes to the imminent arrival of fully autonomous cars, which is highly risky,” Sundararajan told me. “It’s an outcome with a lot of variability, right? It could be three years, it could be 10 years.” In other words, anything that gets in the way of Uber’s work on self-driving cars, he says, is “particularly troubling” for the company’s survival.

Twitter Facebook Most Popular Presented by Carlos Barria / Reuters The Giant Trump Climate Order Is Here Robinson Meyer What it does, what comes next In the final days of the Obama administration, scholars and journalists took stock of all that he had done to combat the dangerous rise of climate change. Barack Obama, they pronounced, had built up a surprisingly vast array of climate-concerned rules and guidelines across the government. He had turned the many policy-making tools of the many federal agencies toward preparing for this one imminent disaster. Well, that was then. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will sign an executive order that will demolish his predecessor’s attempts to slow the pace of climate change. It is an omnibus directive that strikes across the federal government, reversing major rules that aim to restrict greenhouse-gas emissions while simultaneously instructing departments to ignore or downplay the risks of climate change in their decision-making. Continue Reading Jonathan Ernst / Reuters How Right-Wing Media Saved Obamacare Conor Friedersdorf Years of misleading coverage left viewers so misinformed that many were shocked when confronted with the actual costs of repeal. As the Republican Party struggled and then failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, pulling a wildly unpopular bill from the House without even taking a vote, a flurry of insightful articles helped the public understand what exactly just happened. Robert Draper explained the roles that Stephen Bannon, Paul Ryan, and others played in deciding what agenda items President Trump would pursue in what order. Politico reported on how and why the House Freedom Caucus insisted that the health care bill repeal even relatively popular parts of Obamacare. Lest anyone pin blame for the GOP’s failure on that faction, Reihan Salam argued persuasively that responsibility rests with poor leadership by House Speaker Paul Ryan and a GOP coalition with “policy goals that simply can’t be achieved.” Continue Reading Jonathan Ernst / Reuters How Long Can Devin Nunes Hang On? David A. Graham Democrats want the chair of the committee looking into collusion between the Trump administration and Russia to recuse himself, and hearings have ground to a halt for the moment. Embattled House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes is now facing Democratic calls for his recusal from an investigation into the Trump administration’s ties to Russia, as the inquiry grinds to what is at least a temporary halt. The California Republican has been on the hot seat since announcing last week that he had vague but significant information about “incidental collection” of information about Trump transition team members by U.S. intelligence agencies. “Incidental collection” is when the communications of someone who is not the target of surveillance are picked up because they are corresponding with a target. But the revelation, and moreover the manner in which he made it and has conducted himself since, has drawn sharp criticism, including from members of his own committee. Continue Reading Kevin Lamarque / Reuters It Doesn't Get Any Easier for Republicans Now Russell Berman President Trump may feel liberated to pursue tax reform after the failure on health care. But the GOP’s to-do list in Congress only gets harder from here. “In a way I’m glad I got it out of the way,” President Trump told the Washington Post last week in the moments after he and Republican leaders in Congress pulled the plug on their first major legislative priority, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Health care was hard. Really hard. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,” the president had said in a now-infamous quote. The health-care legislation was pulled without a vote last week after House Speaker Paul Ryan told the president there were not enough votes from Republicans to pass it. The implication of Trump’s musings about the difficulty of passing complicated health-care legislation is that he believes the rest of his agenda will be much easier. Tax cuts? Everybody like tax cuts. The legendary border wall. More defense spending. A big, bipartisan infrastructure bill. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Tax Reform Will Be a Nightmare Derek Thompson Donald Trump observed that health care policy is “so complicated.” The next item on his agenda, tax policy, will be just as knotty. “Health care is a very, very complicated issue,” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said last week in an interview with Mike Allen at Axios. “[Tax reform’s] a lot simpler.” Really? America’s health-care industry is roughly one-sixth of the economy, or about $3 trillion. U.S. federal tax revenue is roughly one-sixth of the economy, or about $3 trillion. Health care is a complex national cross-subsidy, where, for example, the healthy support the sick. Taxes are a national cross-subsidy, where, for example, workers support retirees. With health care, Americans interact with with an amorphous institution, with a maze of entrenched interests, in which they ultimately just want access to an excellent bundle of services at an affordable price. With the federal government, Americans interact with ... okay, I think you get the point. Continue Reading Charles Dharapak / AP AP Classes Are a Scam John Tierney The College Board earns over half of all its revenues from the courses—and, in an uncertain environment, students keep being suckered. Fraudulent schemes come in all shapes and sizes. To work, they typically wear a patina of respectability. That's the case with Advanced Placement courses, one of the great frauds currently perpetrated on American high-school students. That's a pretty strong claim, right? You bet. But why not be straightforward when discussing a scam the scale and audacity of which would raise Bernie Madoff's eyebrows? The miscellany of AP courses offered in U.S. high schools under the imprimatur of the College Board probably started with good intentions. The idea, going back to the 1950s, was to offer college-level courses and exams to high-school students. The courses allegedly provide students the kind of rigorous academic experience they will encounter in college as well as an opportunity to earn college credit for the work. Continue Reading Brian Snyder / Reuters The Atheists Struggling to Find Therapists in the Bible Belt Angela Almeida The rise of faith-based counseling in America’s most Christian regions has brought the clash over religious liberties to the therapist’s couch. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, life in the town of Easley, South Carolina, was tense for Leigh Drexler. Pick-up trucks with airborne Confederate flags seemed more prevalent than ever before, and her grandparents—who had never voted in their lives—registered to cast their ballots for the Donald himself. Drexler felt isolated. “My family has always directed their point of view at me, but it has been a million times worse than normal,” she told me last October. “Every time we’re in a conversation, it’s either about the election or religion.” It’s a dynamic that led Drexler, who identifies as a democratic socialist and an atheist, to go online in search of a therapist—someone who would perhaps better understand her lack of faith. She scouted towns within a 20-mile radius, but only “faith-based” practitioners turned up. She resorted to distance counseling over the phone with a therapist a few states away. “I knew there would be Christian counselors here, but I didn’t think that was all I was going to find,” she said. Continue Reading Tyler Golden / NBC The Voice’s Empty Promise of the American Dream Julie Beck The NBC reality singing competition has been selling glittering visions of fame for 11 seasons, but has rarely delivered on them. The Voice’s auditions are some of the best reality TV you can watch. Early in each new season of the NBC show, celebrity coaches will listen to contestants sing with their backs turned. If coaches like what they hear and want to recruit someone for their “team,” they press a button, and their giant red chair spins around for a grand reveal. (If more than one turns, the contestant gets to pick his or her coach.) I see those chairs a-swivelin’ in a commercial, and I can’t resist Hulu-binging several hour-and-a-half-long episodes of these blind auditions. Still, I’ve never made it through an entire season of The Voice. I get enticed by the auditions, and usually stick around through both the battle and the knockout rounds, when coaches pair members of their teams in head-to-head sing-offs. But I always stop watching during the bloated live shows, where couch potatoes actually get to vote for their favorite singers. At that point it’s just American Idol-style voting in broadcasts padded with backstage fashion and performances by the coaches, and oh-so-many commercials between contestant performances, and the unique energy has faded. By this, the 12th season, I should really know better.

Conservative Catholics and left-wing feminists often find each other on opposite sides of political debates, especially when it comes to what women should do with their bodies. Yet in Europe, there is a reproductive rights issue on which the Catholic Church, well-known for its staunch pro-life position, is finding common ground with pro-choice feminists: surrogacy. The practice whereby a woman carries a pregnancy to term for third parties is legal in the United States and Canada, but not in most of Western Europe. Some countries, like France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Sweden, have banned surrogacy outright. Others, such as the United Kingdom, don’t have specific laws against surrogacy, but recognize the woman who gives birth to a child as the legal mother, making any surrogate agreements unenforceable. The European Parliament rejected surrogacy in a 2015 non-binding resolution. Continue Reading Kim Kyung Hoon / Reuters No, We Can’t Say Whether Cancer Is Mostly Bad Luck Ed Yong How some media outlets magnified the problems with a controversial new paper Two years ago, Time wrongly reported that “Most cancer is beyond your control.” The Guardian incorrectly wrote: “Two-thirds of adult cancers largely ‘down to bad luck’ rather than genes.” And the BBC misleadingly said: “Most cancer types ‘just bad luck.’” All of these deceptive headlines arose from a widely misinterpreted study that looked at the role of random chance in initiating cancers. That paper was itself criticized for a slew of methodological flaws, and spawned more than a hundred rebuttals. Its authors are now back with a follow-up, which reads like a weird blend of doubling-down, clarification, and mea culpa.  Although they’ve gone some way towards addressing the problems of their first paper, their critics still say they’ve made several of the same conceptual mistakes. And once again, their work has led to similarly botched headlines.As one scientist wrote on Twitter, “It’s bad luck that we are misreporting the same thing twice in two years.” Ultimately, this story reveals less about why people do or don’t get cancers, and more about how hard it is to talk or think about these diseases.

Locating your loved ones with Google's tracker app No secret outings: Google has developed a free app called Trusted Contacts that allows users to share their whereabouts with those they trust. — dpa Whether it's during a hike in the mountains or when walking home alone at night, there are occasions when it's vital to know where a relative or close friend is. Google has developed a free app called Trusted Contacts that allows users to share their whereabouts with those they trust and to call up the location of their loved ones. The status of contacts designated as "trusted" can be viewed at any time, allowing users to see if someone has moved recently or was online. But the precise location of a trusted contact can also be called up – something that the person concerned has to permit or otherwise reject. If the user feels unsafe, they can also actively inform someone about their location for a certain period. Where a precise location report is not possible, the last location is shown. Users should also be aware that if they don't decline a request in five minutes, the location is revealed in any case. It's also worth considering what impact this Android app might have on a relationships. Knowing the location of another person carries a great deal of potential for misuse. The app also has the potential to strain relationships if, for example, one person is less inclined to share their position.

Now Amazon’s Alexa has had a headstart on Google and boasts over 10,000 skills, but it looks like Google is slowly but surely catching up. In a report from VentureBeat, it seems that Google has recently added about 15 new skills/services to Google Assistant (and in turn Google Home). These new services aren’t really related to each other and will vary, ranging from getting motivational quotes from Jaden Smith (Will Smith’s son, for those wondering), getting movie ratings from IMDB, finding out the weather on Mars, and so on. However there are some notable services such as being able to keep track of your food’s expiration dates with Chefling, meaning that Google Assistant will soon be able to remind you that a particular food in your fridge is about to expire. There is also a service that is linked with Computer Builder that will help walk users through the steps of building their own PC. If these sound like interesting skills and services you’d like to access, note that they should already be live and you can check them out via the Google Home app on your phone under the “Services” menu.

Jump to navigation Could Google challenge Sky and BT for rights to show Premier League matches? Champions League and Europa League finals being streamed on YouTube. 2 Comments Tweet Speculation is brewing that Google could be set to enter the fray for the rights to show Premier League football. BT Sport recently streamed live coverage of the Uefa Champions League final and the Europa League final on the Google-owned video sharing site YouTube. This has led to the likes of the Daily Mail suggesting that Google could use these games to gauge whether it would be worthwhile looking to secure the rights to show domestic football action in the future. "So far Google have shown no appetite for owning sports content, despite having the resources to challenge Sky and BT Sport for the big football rights," the newspaper observed. "But they are showing more football on their YouTube platform and big viewing figures for the two finals could see a change of strategy." This opens up the possibility of Sky and BT customers getting fewer games in future seasons, while the arrival of a new player in the bidding war could force prices up for subscribers.

Twitter Facebook Google Play faces cat and mouse game with sneaky Android malware Hackers constantly try to slip malware into the Google Play store, and they succeed Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 25 March, 2017 05:16 - - - - print email Comments What’s the best way to avoid Android malware? Downloading all your apps from the Google Play store -- where software is vetted – is perhaps the best advice. But that doesn’t mean Google Play is perfect. Security researchers do find new Android malware lurking on Google’s official app store. That’s because hackers are coming up with sneaky ways to infiltrate the platform, despite the vetting processes that protect it. "Eventually, every wall can be breached," said Daniel Padon, a researcher at mobile security provider Check Point. To be sure, most Android users will probably never encounter malware on the Google Play store. Last year, the amount of malicious software that reached the platform amounted to only 0.16 percent of all apps, according to a new report from Google. That's contributed to relatively tiny malware infection rates across the 1.4 billion Android devices in use today. But when a bad app does slip in to the Play store, it can spread. Check Point has been among the security firms on the watch for new android malware. Earlier this year, it uncovered over 20 apps on the Google Play store that contained malicious coding designed to generate fraudulent ad revenue for its creators. The infected software was downloaded several million times. Months before, Check Point found another malware strain that was embedded in dozens of different apps on the store. The malware was designed to enslave devices in a botnet and appeared to infect between 500,000 and 2 million devices. Trend Micro Android malware called DressCode spread through dozens of apps on Google Play last year. So how does the malware get in? Every app that goes through Google Play is first scanned for any harmful behavior, which includes checking the coding and running it in a virtual environment. But even so, malicious processes can be tricky to detect, Padon said. For instance, hackers will incorporate a "dropper" into a seemingly benign app. The dropper will act as a time-bomb, staying silent but downloading additional malware at a later time. In other cases, hackers have been found hiding malicious coding by using encryption, surrounding it with meaningless commands, or designing the harmful processes to remain inactive when run on a virtual machine. Padon said the internet giant could be doing more to vet apps. The problem, he claims, is that Google relies too much on automated testing to root out the problem. "It might be the strongest behavioral analysis engine on the planet," Padon said. But testing each app on a real, human-operated device is still the best way to detect malware, he said. Google didn’t comment on this story. However, it’s latest Android security report, published this week, does say: "no review process is perfect." Each month, the Play store will add 40,000 or more apps, according to AppBrain. Managing that business while keeping the software malware-free is no easy task. Automated testing is the best bet to scan all those apps in a time-efficient way. Nevertheless, the security of Android has often been compared to Apple’s iOS, and the result hasn’t always been favorable. Unlike iOS, which is under the control of Apple, the Android operating system is fragmented across numerous handset vendors, some of which struggle to keep the software securely patched. That’s made Android, and the Google Play store, worthwhile targets for hackers. "Since most users expect the apps in Google Play to be clean, they’re left vulnerable, making it easy for the malware to infect a massive number of users at once," said Rowland Yu, a researcher with security firm Sophos. In the past two years, there have been more than two dozen malware strains found slipping into the Google Play store, according to his research. To try and popularize the malware, hackers will make them look like games, utility apps like energy savers, or drum up fake reviews for them. Fortunately, when Google detects any malware, it will quickly pull the apps from the store, and sometimes ban the developers involved, Yu said. But he doesn’t see an end to this cat and mouse game. Like Padon, Yu points to machine testing. "Google heavily relies on machines to test and review the safety and security of apps," he said. "Only a small number of suspicious apps are actually handed over for human review." Google Install rates for potentially harmful applications and unwanted software on Android devices are higher when users download from third-party app stores, according to Google. However, even as malware occasionally slips by, Google is making progress at detecting it faster once it's downloaded, in part with a feature in Android devices called "Verify Apps." It will scan the software over a phone to make sure the apps are behaving safely. If they aren't, the security feature can have the offending apps removed. "Verify Apps conducted 750 million daily checks in 2016," Google’s security researchers said in a blog post. This helped the company reduce malicious app installation last year. Andrew Blaich, a security researcher at mobile security firm Lookout, said the malware situation on Google Play isn’t the pandemic that can be found on some third-party Android app stores, which often do less vetting. "The safest assurance you have to minimize your chance of malware on your Android device is to use the official Google Play store," he said. Security researchers also advise users to always look at the user reviews for an app. Bad reviews can be a sign that the app is malicious in some way. Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter!

(Photo by Brett Duke, Nola.com | The Times-Picayune) (BRETT DUKE) Print Email Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author on March 26, 2017 at 8:33 PM, updated March 26, 2017 at 8:36 PM comments An app created by Google that tracks which buildings in the United States are "solar-viable" shows New Orleans to be a potentially great candidate for solar power production. Updated last month, Google's Project Sunroof app estimates 91 percent of all buildings in New Orleans are potentially solar-viable, totaling 121,000 roofs capable of generating nearly 3 million megawatts per year. Roughly speaking, that would result in 1.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide kept from entering the atmosphere, or about 371,000 passenger cars taken off the road, the app estimates. Jefferson Parish yields even higher results: the app figures 92 percent of all buildings are potentially solar-viable, accounting for about 142,000 roofs capable of generating around 3.7 million megawatts per year. Project Sunroof solar-viability estimations Parish Solar-Viability Roofs Electricty (MWh AC per Year) Orleans 91% 121,000 2.9 million Jefferson 92% 142,000 3.7 million St. Charles 81% 4,800 143,000 St. John 81% 5,300 118,000 Plaquemines 93% 5,000 192,000 St. Tammany n/a n/a n/a St. Bernard n/a n/a n/a Source: Project Sunroof data explorer (February 2017). The goal of the Project Sunroof app, Google says, is to estimate how much money a home can save on its utility bill as well as how much less carbon dioxide a region would emit into the atmosphere. The search engine produces results for states, counties, cities, zip codes and even individual home addresses. Check out the app's solar-viability estimator here. The Project Sunroof app further includes an energy cost saving estimator, culled from data supplied by clean-power research groups. Just plug in a home address to see what the app calculates in savings. Try out the savings estimator here. First released in 2015, the app calculates the amount of sun hitting a roof through 3D models derived from aerial imagery, the tech company explains. The app also takes into account local weather patterns, using data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In February, the app expanded to factor in roughly 60 million homes among all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. That's up from 43 million among 42 states encompassed by the app last summer. However, there are some caveats to Project Sunroof. First, data on roofs depends on rough building outlines found in Google's map app that may be outdated due to new construction. A roof must be wide enough to hold four contiguous solar panels, and there's a chance the app could miss impeding objects such as chimneys. Likewise, the Project Sunroof app does not incorporate other obstacles like "financial and societal" constraints. Louisiana no longer offers solar tax credits. In all, the app's data could be skewed by as much as 25 percent, Google notes. Despite the shortcomings, the aims of the app are lofty. "Project Sunroof wants to make it effortless to understand the potential of solar power," according to the app's methodology handbook.

The first time you try on Android Wear it can feel as thin as a £2 Primark t-shirt. It doesn’t have millions of apps like a phone. And it doesn’t have more power than some laptops… like a phone. But this isn’t a piece of cotton. It’s a smartwatch system with loads of depth hidden behind its ultra-simple shop front. Here are the tips and tricks you need to learn to get the most from Android Wear 2.0. LEVEL 1: BEGINNER Staring at your new Android Wear watch with a look of bafflement? Here's where to start... 1) CHANGE YOUR FACE Ready for your smartwatch 101? One of the first things you’ll want to try is changing your watch’s face. Just swipe right-to-left on the watch face to bring up your array of ‘favourite’ faces. To start with there’ll just be a few in here. Scroll to the right and you can add more to this selection from the list of all the installed ones. Google’s own watch faces are pretty good if you don’t mind looking like the rest of the (small) smartwatch-owning crowd, but there are also loads more available to download from Google Play too. 2) USING THE WATCH AS A PHONE-UNLOCKER If you’re not too worried about your friends or co-workers tweeting about how much you love Bieber on your account as soon as your back is turned, you can make your phone auto-unlock whenever it’s connected to your watch. The phone is secure should you accidentally leave it somewhere, but you don’t have to type-in your pin or use the fingerprint scanner 700 times a day. All you need to do is add the watch as a ‘trusted’ device in the Secure Lock part of Settings on your phone. You can actually do this with any Bluetooth device, but a smartwatch is just about perfect for the job. 3) FIND YOUR PHONE Here’s a feature that stares you right in the face, but is still ignored by most of the smartwatch owners we know. It’s called Find My Phone and could end up being the feature you use most often if you’re, y’know, a bit scatty. It should come preinstalled on any Wear 2.0 watch (it’s called Find my Phone), and simply makes your phone ring after a few seconds: just to it doesn’t instantly start bleating in case you accidentally run the app. Smart. 4) STREAMLINE NOTIFICATIONS Getting notifications on your wrist can turn into a bit of a nightmare when Candy Crush starts complaining you’ve stopped playing every 4 hours. Thankfully, you can choose exactly which notifications get a boarding pass onto your wrist. You do this in the Android Wear app on your phone. Just tap the little cog icon at the top of the screen, then select Block App Notifications in the menu that pops-up. Here you can add to the blacklist of apps that send you notifications you really don’t need to see on your wrist. 5) CINEMA-PROOF YOUR SMARTWATCH If you’re in the cinema: don’t talk, don’t eat anything too noisy and don’t take your phone out to, well, do anything. Your smartwatch screen should be off too. Thankfully it takes about 1.5 seconds. Just swipe down, or flick your wrist down (with gestures enabled), from the watch face then tap the little icon that looks like a watch. This will kill the screen until you press the power button. 6) EKE OUT MORE BATTERY LIFE Want your smartwatch to last a week between charges? Don’t buy an Android Wear watch. The only ones that get close to this are those that can shrink back into basically being fitness trackers. Still, if you’re going on holiday and don’t want to have to charge the thing every day, your best bet is to turn off the always-on screen function. You get a worse smartwatch in return, but sometimes needs must, eh? Swipe down from the watch face, tap the little cog icon, then Display. Now un-toggle “Always-on screen” down at the bottom of this menu. 7) MAKE FRIENDS WITH GOOGLE ASSISTANT If you want to really get into the smartwatch life, you’re going to have to swallow your pride and embrace talking to your watch. Sorry. On the bright side, at least a Wear watch doesn’t talk back to you like Siri. There are two quick routes to accessing the Google digital assistant. You can just say “OK Google” while using the watch or, if you want to keep the chat to a minimum, just long-press the power button. Level 2: Intermediate The foundations of your Android Wear mastery have been laid. Now it's time to build some exterior walls... 8) Find 100 new watch faces Your Wear watch probably comes with a half dozen or so faces. And there’s a good chance a bunch of them look like an impersonation of the impersonation luxury watch you’d find for a tenner down at the local market. If you like the cod luxury watch look, that’s great. But there’s also an app that’ll give you easy access to a whole new galaxy of faces. It’s called Facer. Install this using the Play Store app then select Set Watch face from within the store app once it’s done. Skip back to the watch display and you’ll see… not much. But install the Facer app on your phone and you can sync over a new face in a few seconds. There’s even one based on Fallout 4’s pip-boy. Download Facer 9) Turn it into your wallet Want a new way to show off your smartwatch? Paying for stuff with it is much more effective than just getting its shiny bezel to glint in the sun. It’s all thanks to Android Pay, which lets you use a Wear watch like a contactless card. You’ll need sync a card to Android Pay using your phone and the Pay app, but can then buy items just by waving the watch over a contactless pad in a shop. Quickly double press the function button on your watch and it’ll zap over to the Pay app, saving you from fiddling around and holding up the queue like someone trying to pay in coppers. 10) Track your sleep Wear watches aren’t really designed to track your sleep as standard, probably because some of them struggle to last 24 hours off a charge. You can force the watch to monitor your sleepy-time using a third-party app, though, called Sleep as Android. Download this right from the watch using the Google Play app, fire it up as you’re getting ready for bed and it’ll do the rest. For best results either wear the watch as you sleep or keep it by your pillow so it can monitor your movements. 11) Customise your watch faces Android Wear watch faces are so customisable these days that they make the locks screen of your phone look rigour-mortis stiff. You can choose all sorts of information to pack into them, from boring-but-useful bits like your watch’s battery life to the number of calories you’ve munched through in the day. How? It’s because some of these little watch face widgets can actually pull-in data from other apps, like food logger Lifesum. To give your watch face a tweak, just flick horizontally to get to the watch face selection screen then tap the little cog icon under the one you want to use. You’ll see a Data option there that lets you choose these extra bits of info. 12) Personalise your apps menu Google’s solution to making an operating system that lives in a 1in screen but doesn’t burst at the seams is to keep the bits you use every day simple. You can’t make folders in the apps menu or fiddle with how the icons are arranged. But there is a trick to avoid having to scroll through 30 of the things every time you want to use an app. Your last-used app will end up right at the top of the screen as standard but you can also push a few favourites up there too. Just long-press on an app icon to give it this special ‘pinned’ badge. If there’s one trick to getting on with Wear 2.0 day-to-day, it’s this. 13) Master the magic button No two Android Wear watches are the same, and the latest version of the software is designed with this in mind. Does there seem to be a spare button on the thing? There’s a good chance you can customise what this does with about ten seconds of tweaking. Let’s take the Huawei Watch 2 as an example. It has an extra hardware button you can use to quick-launch any app you like in the Personalisation part of the Settings menu - you get to this by swiping down on the watch face and tapping the cog icon. Don’t just make do with whatever the manufacturer pre-selected if it doesn’t work for you. 14) Control it with a flick of your wrist First world problem #10455: you have brownie mix all over your hands but desperately want to read the WhatsApp you just received on your watch. It’s heartbreaking. There’s a solution. Turn on 'Wrist Gestures' in the Settings menu and you can scroll up and down menus and between notifications with a sharp flick of your wrist. A twist away from you pulls up a notification from the watch face, for example. Give the watch a jangle-jangle triple waggle and it’ll head back to the watch face regardless of what’s currently on-screen too. 15) Master Google Assistant Six useful things you can do with Google Assistant 1) Get directions - Ask to get somewhere and you’ll be plugged into Google Maps with step-by-step instructions on your watch. 2) Translations - Need to know what beer is in Spanish? No problem. 3) Set a timer or alarm - Time to bin the egg timer. 4) Send a message to or call someone - This one’s pretty obvious, but useful if you don’t mind treating a virtual assistant like a Mad Men PA. 5) Launch an app - No more scrolling down the apps menu, just say “launch X”. 6) Make a note - Here’s one of the better reasons to talk to your watch, especially as it’ll hook up with various note-taking apps like Microsoft OneNote Six fun things you can do with Google Assistant 1) Roll a virtual die - Ask the assistant to roll a die and it’ll give you a result. You can even choose how many sides the virtual die has too 2) Get truly awful random numbers - We tried asking for a random number between 1 and 1000 and got a result under 10 each time. The system is rigged 3) Ask how old celebs are - As long as Wikipedia knows, the Google Assistant will too 4) Get awful jokes - If Christmas cracker jokes are that bit too high-end for your tastes, ask for a joke 5) “Bark like a dog” - This is just one of the many easter eggs that earns you a silly response from the Google Assistant 6) “Read me a poem” - You won’t end up with a 1000-word epic, but it’s free Advanced Very good, young padawan, but you still have much to learn. Much to learn you still have... 16) Get your IFTTT on If there’s a feature that seems missing from your watch, there’s a good chance you can graft it in using IFTTT (which stands for “if this then that”). When something happens, it fires off a reaction in your watch. It sounds like programming, but you don’t even need to spend an hour learning how to do this. All you need to do is download the IFTTT phone app, and you can make a Wear-ready “applet” in a few seconds. Top uses include sending an alert if the weather report says it’s going to rain tomorrow, showing a quickie preview of any phone camera images on your watch’s screen and controlling your Hue lights with a press of a button in the IFTTT Wear app. 17) Get a new keyboard To become a true jedi master of Android Wear, you have to get your head around typing on a keyboard that fits on half of a 1in screen. It’s as painful as that sounds, to start with. But just like an Android phone, you don’t have to put up with Google’s own version if you continue to find it has comfortable as jamming your pinkie in a pencil sharpener. Just search for ‘keyboard’ in Google Play on the watch and you’ll find a bunch of alternatives, including TouchPal. To use one of these keyboards, download them from Google Play, then go to Settings > Personalisation > Input methods and then flick ‘on’ the toggles of the new keyboard(s). Then simply long-press the keyboard while typing to change the one you actually use. 18) Make your own watch face If you’re the kind of person who likes to accessorise their clothes with rips/badges/patches/pigeon feathers, you may well like the idea of making your very own watch face. This isn’t a Google feature, but something added by the clever folks at Androidslide. Download Watchmaker and you can not only make as many watch faces as you like, element by element, but also download reams of them made by other people. You’ll want the paid-for Premium version to actually make a fully-featured face, but given the flexibility on offer, we think it’s worth the few quid Androidslide charges. Download Watchmaker 19) Get WhatsApp ready There’s no dedicated, standalone WhatsApp app for Wear yet, but you can actually read and reply to messages without one. When a message comes in, just tap on it (don’t swipe it off!) and then scroll down through your recent blabbering to see the reply options. There will be a few canned responses in here, but also the option to speak or type your own reply using Wear’s miniature keyboard. Just make sure you read what Google makes of your scrawl before sending, as it has come up with all sorts of weird replies so far based on our swipes. 20) Make your finger a stylus One of the most ambitious parts of Wear 2.0 is a feature that lets you handwrite messages or search terms using your finger as a virtual pen. We wouldn’t suggest writing your first novel like this, but you need to give it a shot at least once. The easiest way to switch over to this kind of ‘keyboard’ is to go the Google Play app, tap the magnifying glass search icon then long-press the little keyboard icon. This takes you to the screen where you choose your keyboard. Select Google Handwriting and then get your best stylus finger ready. 21) Become a developer Learning to develop Android apps and games takes time and effort. Loads of it. You can trick your watch into thinking you’re a dev in about 30 seconds, though. Flick down from the watch face, tap the cog icon and then scroll right down to the bottom of the Settings menu. Tap system, then About. Now repeatedly tap the Build Number entry and after a few seconds you’ll see a prompt telling you you’re a developer. Now you just wait for the millions in royalties to roll in… Not really. What this does is to open up a Developer Options menu in Settings. You’ll want to leave most of the options alone, but can do things like force the watch screen to stay on while charging and control how quick animation transitions are.

Stanton, a veteran of Twitter, Google, Yahoo and a presidential administration, now serves as chief marketing officer of genetic testing startup Color Genomics. Her professional journey from East Coast to West, and back and forth again, has given her rare insight into the workplace cultures that shape us today. For its podcast, Fortt Knox sat down with Stanton to talk about the environment for women in tech, and her journey to the executive ranks in Silicon Valley. Here are some key lessons from our conversation: Outsmart the Culture Stanton's timing was great, joining Google in 2003 after a stint at Yahoo and a maternity leave. But she encountered some obstacles right out of the gate. "When I was at Yahoo, I was hired as a product manager for Yahoo Finance, and helped build the site and build it internationally. And so when I came to Google, naturally I thought, 'I can be a product manager here,'" she said. "And Google said, 'No, I'm sorry, you don't have a computer science background.' And I was like, but I just helped build this great product on the web, and I've been there for three years, and I was promoted." The leadership structure at Google was unmoved. No computer science background, no product management. But that didn't stop Stanton. She found engineers who would work with her, and brought Google Finance to market. Along the way, she gained a reputation as a person who could ship new ideas. Source: #Angels The #Angels investment group. Pictured are: Left to right, top row: Chloe Sladden, Jana Messershcmidt Jessica Verrilli and Vijaya Gadde, Katie Stanton, April Underwood, left to right bottom row. Move Around Stanton is from New York, went to college in Tennessee, ditched the East Coast for Silicon Valley in her 20s, and did a stint as director of citizen participation in the Obama administration and as a technology advisor in the State Department before heading back to California. International travel has helped broaden her horizons; she was serving as vice president of Twitter's international business when the company went public. That now influences what Stanton looks for when she's hiring. "I look for people with international experience, something I believe strongly in. People who speak foreign languages, I think, have always stood out to me," Stanton said, adding that she looks for those qualities even in roles that don't require it. "I think it just brings a different lens and a different empathy, a different perspective to things." As someone who hadn't traveled internationally when I started my career, I couldn't help but notice that in some ways, Stanton's preference for well-traveled people could be as limiting as Google's preference for coders as product managers. The key, it seems, is to show you can deliver what the job requires even if your resume isn't the obvious fit. Find Role Models Stanton was fortunate enough to work for a string of female bosses during her six-year run at Google, an experience that's pretty rare in Silicon Valley's tech scene. She says having women in leadership positions will also be important to the next generation. "You can't be what you can't see. I think for a lot of girls, not seeing other female professors of computer science, other leaders in business" can be a barrier, she said. "We still have a lot of work to do for women in leadership positions." She's certainly doing her part. Fortt Knox is a weekly podcast from CNBC anchor Jon Fortt.

While older, the LG V20 remains a pretty powerful beast, especially for videographers and music lovers, and it has some unique strengths the G6 lacks. Which phone is the better choice for your needs (and wallet)? Here's a breakdown of the key differences — and our recommendations. LG G6 LG V20 Price $650-$720 $480-$829* Display (Resolution) 5.7 (2880 x 1440) 5.7 (2560 x 1440) CPU Snapdragon 821 Snapdragon 820 RAM 4GB 4GB Storage 32GB 64GB microSD Yes Yes Rear Camera Dual 13 MP 16 MP + 8 MP Front Camera 5 MP 5 MP Battery/Removable 3,200 mAh/No 3,200 mAh/Yes Size (inches) 5.9 x 2.8 x 0.31 6.3 x 3.1 x 0.3 Weight (ounces) 5.8 6.1 * T-Mobile sale price of $480. Normally $769 Design The LG V20 isn't an ugly phone, but it's nowhere near as fetching as the G6. The LG G6 has an elegant and sturdy glass back.,The metal design just looks uninspired compared to the glass-and-metal body on the G6. Plus, the G6 is shorter, narrower and lighter, even though it has the same size display as its cousin. That makes the G6 easier to operate with one hand. The G6 has another advantage over the V20; the former has a water-resistant design, so you can get the G6 wet and even submerge if for up to 30 minutes without worry. Only the V20 has a removable battery.The one benefit of the V20's design is that it has a removable back, which means you can easily replace the battery yourself — helpful if you're using the phone on a prolonged video shoot. MORE: You Can Get a Free Google Home When You Buy LG G6 Display This is the killer feature for the LG G6. You get a 5.7-inch screen with a higher resolution than the V20 (2880 x 1440 vs 2560 x 1440). Plus, the 18:9 aspect ratio allows for more immersive widescreen viewing. HDR support and an 18:9 ratio make the G6's screen stand out.It gets even better for the G6, as only it supports HDR and Dolby Vision, which means you can expect to see more colors and better contrast. Both Amazon and Netflix have HDR shows and movies to watch. If you like quick access to shortcuts, the V20 does offer a unique second screen on top of the primary display, which provides quick access to your favorite apps and other shortcuts. Cameras The LG V20 is a solid camera phone. Its main 16-MP rear cam offers a higher resolution, and thus more detail, than phones with 12-MP cams, such as the S7 Edge. In addition, the V20's secondary 12-millimeter 8-MP cam offers superwide 135-degree viewing angles that can capture expansive scenes. Both camera on the G6 shoot 13 megapixels.The G6 steps those specs up by offering two rear 13-MP shooters, one of which shoots wide-angle photos (though just at 125 degrees). More important, the image quality is seems better in our early tests. In fact, both the G6 beat both the Google Pixel and the iPhone 7 Plus in two separate camera shoot-outs. Up front, both the G6 and V20 sports 5-MP camera with a wide field of view, but the V20 has a wider viewing angle of 120 degrees (vs 100 degrees). Specs and Performance Understandably, the V20 is a generation behind the G6 when it comes to the processor. The G6 features the Snapdragon 821 chip, compared to the 820 CPU for the V20. Both phones comes with 4GB of RAM. The G6 has a faster CPU, but the V20 has more storage.It's not like the 820 is a slouch, but you should expect better multitasking performance and a smoother gaming and VR experience with the G6. However, the V20 comes standard with more storage, offering 64GB to the G6's 32GB. Fortunately, you can add more via microSD to both phones.

The good news is that you should be able to add Google Assistant to the V20 without much trouble. You can take the G6 in the shower.The V20 is really designed for content creators, as it not only offers a slew of manual video controls but also high-gain microphones, resulting in crystal-clear audio. There's a built-in, 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC, which results in better sound overall for music lovers. Also notable is the secondary display, which we found useful for accessing recently used apps and contextual settings. High-gain mics make the V20's video sound as good as it looks.Although the G6 is really about getting a widescreen display in a compact design, it has some very good special features. These include the HDR support on the display and water-resistant design. MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery Life Price and Value Both the G6 and V20 are available from all of the major carriers. Even though the V20 has been around longer, the pricing is pretty comparable between these two phones. The best deal as of this writing for the LG V20 is on T-Mobile, which is offering the phone for $480 (usually $769). AT&T sells the V20 for a fairly steep $829, and you can pick it up from Verizon for a much more reasonable $576. Sprint's V20 costs $792. Just keep in mind that the G6 comes with half as much storage as the V20. MORE: The Best and Worst Phone Carriers The G6 is priced pretty reasonably for being a newer flagship. It costs $650 at T-Mobile, $672 at Verizon, $708 at Sprint and $720 at AT&T. It gets better. For a limited time, you can get a Google Home for free when you order the G6 before April 30. That's a $129 value. Bottom Line The LG V20 has some things going for it compared to the G6. It offers a removable battery, more built-in storage, and you can get it for as low as $480 (from T-Mobile). Plus, we like the secondary front display and high-gain mics for recording video. The G6 is our top pick overall. However, for most shoppers, the LG G6 is the better bet. You get the same size screen in a more compact design along with HDR support for more colors. We also like that the G6 is water-resistant and that you get sharper dual cameras on the back. Both phones are worth buying, but the G6 has the edge.

Kia and Holden first Australian brands to suspend YouTube programmatic ads GM Holden confirmed it suspended programmatic placement of ads on YouTube over the weekend after it became aware of its brand appearing next to controversial videos on YouTube. Kia also suspended its advertising over the weekend and said it was now seeking clarity from Google. “Programmatic advertising was suspended as soon as we were made aware of this particular incident. It will remain suspended until such time as we can meet with Google to further clarify the application of this type of advertising,” a Kia spokesperson told Mumbrella. Holden said it was continuing to look into how its brand had been linked to inappropriate content and acted immediately when it was alerted. “Holden in no way supports the content our advertising has been inadvertently associated with. We’re proud of our diversity credentials,” the company said in a statement. “We value our good relationship with Google but in line with General Motors’ global response and Holden’s diversity stance we have instructed our media agency to suspend all advertising on YouTube until we are confident Google can protect our brand from offensive content. We’ll work with Google to achieve this.” YouTube parent company Google has repeated its stance shared in other countries that it is working with advertisers to solve their concerns, but would not name local advertisers who were now also suspending programmatic ads on its platform. “We don’t comment on individual customers but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” the company said in a statement. “While we recognise that no system will be 100% perfect, we believe these major steps will further safeguard our advertisers’ brands and we are committed to being vigilant and continuing to improve over time.” Google is facing rising concerns around the globe since advertisers started question the content their ads were being placed with and the associated brand safety concerns. The UK government and Havas in the UK led the charge and by the end of last week the concerns were being expressed by major brands in the US with the likes of AT&T, Verizon and GSK all moving to distance themselves from the platform. Kia and Holden are the first Australian brands to confirm the suspension of YouTube ads. Simon Canning Simon is Mumbrella's marketing and advertising editor.

Reply Bandwagon much? 27 Mar 17 I had this issue during Sandyhook, when my client who sold playgrounds had ads running next to the articles. It caused a little uproar but at the end they accepted this would happen. Arn’t these large companies slightly embarrassed that it’s taken them this long to realise programmatic has always worked this way? Reply How offensive 27 Mar 17 Does anyone know what the supposedly offensive content is and what it has to do with brands’ diversity stances? Reply Anonymous 27 Mar 17 “We’re proud of our diversity credentials,” the company said in a statement, “As you can see in the ads that were pulled, we’ve featured several prominent people of colour, and at least two women, giving us AAA Diversity Credentials.” Reply Really? 27 Mar 17 @anonymous Totally agree. This has been the case forever and agencies would turn a blind eye because the clicks were so efficient! Furthermore, the issues at hand seem pretty small in terms of reach: “pennies , not pounds” was the response from Google UK which suggests that the spends and incidents were somewhat isolated? Sure it doesn’t make it acceptable but the irony in all this is that newspapers are going in for the so called kill – good luck. I would have thought that the phone tapping incidents in the UK were more harmful to brands? Didn’t that exec get reinstated and receive some kind of promo? The markets don’t seem to care: “The RBC analysts reiterated their “outperform” rating on Alphabet and their $1025-per-share price target on the stock. “Google is one of the strongest, most consistent fundamental stories in tech. Period,” they wrote.” Reply Ricky bobby 27 Mar 17 It’s only taken this long because the agencies Google deals were so good they couldn’t walk away from YouTube, so they told their clients ‘she’ll be right mate, YouTube is sweet as! After all, it’s google! ” I guess advertisers have finally grown a pair. Reply little confused 27 Mar 17 how many sponsored ads played in a news feed on Facebook next to offensive material, or hate speech or fake news today? 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000? Is it less or more than YouTube? Granted people don’t watch Facebook ads for too long so there is less brand damage! But seriously, both are strong advertising platforms, however i have missed the distinction as to why Google is getting the $’s pulled but Facebook is not. Personally i feel i have far more control on YouTube when running ads for clients – i have no idea what are in people’s personal news feeds on Facebook Reply Erm? 28 Mar 17 Do KIA and Holden advertise in the Sydney Daily Terrorgraph? If so, I am expecting them to be pulling their spend anytime soon then! What about the Mail online? How much of this is a play by the disrupted trying to muddy the waters and how much of this are agencies trying to claw business into their own, murky, trading desks. Savvy clients will be rolling their eyes at the old school smearing away.

Symantec Reassures CA Customers, Downplays Google Problem GO Google intends to deprecate Symantec CA-issued certificates Mar 27, 2017 00:43 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Symantec is trying to reassure its CA customers that the situation with Google isn't as bad as it seems to be.  In a message sent out to customers, Symantec is trying to downplay Google's intended "punishment" for the certificate issuer. The tech giant announced last week that it was planning to stop recognizing the extended validation status of all certificates issued by Symantec-owned certificate authorities for Chrome, with the changes to take effect immediately. The decision came after the company conducted an investigation and discovered that at least 30,000 certificates, spanning over several years, could have been mis-issued. "This is also coupled with a series of failures following the previous set of mis-issued certificates from Symantec, causing us to no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years," Google explained. At this point, this is just a proposal, but, if implemented, a large number of websites will suffer, including the likes of PayPal. Downplaying the impact For its part, Symantec seeks to reassure customers that they can continue to trust their SSL/TLS certificates, using as reasoning the fact that Google has outlined proposals, not actions, which they intend to object to. "In the event, Google implements its proposal, Symantec will ensure your websites, webservers or web applications continue to work across browsers. Specifically, this may require Symantec to reissue your certificates, which we would do as needed, at no charge to you, to meet the fully expected validity period," writes Symantec's VP & GM for Website Security, Roxane Divol. "In addition, Google’s proposal requires shorter validity certificates, which we would support. We anticipate Google may attempt to impose this shorter validity period on the entire industry, as they have previously tried to do so through an initiative at the CA/Browser forum that was voted down. Shorter certificate validity periods increase customer expense, which we are working to reduce by making considerable investments in automation," she adds. The company goes on to say that Google's claim that they have mis-issued 30,000 certificates is not true, referring to the event in January where 127 certificates were identified as mis-issued by a third party. What they avoid saying is that Google was pushed to conduct its own investigation following that January report and came up with the new number of 30,000 certificates. Safety problem In the same forum, Google's Chromium experts carried on with the discussion and explained that the issue with these certificates stemmed from improperly supervised delegated third parties. However, the inability to technically identify these certificates or independently assess that the issues were limited to these certificates made Google see them as a security risk. Google's Ryan Sleevi explains that Symantec has already terminated their relationship with these partners regarding new certificate issuance so they have some level of trust that any new certificates would follow policies and practices. "This proposal attempts to restore that trust to the sufficient and necessary level, by describing a process and set of changes that can be made to Chrome to provide a sufficient level of assurance, and to mitigate further risks should that trust be found to be misplaced," Sleevi explains. #Symantec#CA certificate#Google#Chrome subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news British Authorities Slam WhatsApp for Encryption Used by London Terrorist Most Android Users Haven't Had a Security Patch in a While, Report Shows Google Says Symantec Misissued 30K Security Certificates, Will Restrict Access ESET: 87 Malicious Apps Disguised as Minecraft Mods Found on Google Play - Update Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Samsung Store in Singapore Catches Fire Ahead of Galaxy S8 Unveil All 2017 iPhones to Support Wireless Charging, Apple Watch to Feature LTE How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update RTM Right Now Survey: 93% of Millennials Aren't Quitting Uber Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Latest Black Lab Linux Weekly Build Optimizes Swap File Management for SSD Windows 10, the Only Way to Go: 8 in 10 Companies to Install the OS, Study Shows    Symantec is doing its best to reassure customers Related Apps hide.me VPN: An easy to configure VPN client for Windows that enables you to hide your real identity while navigating online by connecting to a VPN server Metasploit Community: Penetration testing tool for security professionals that lets them run a discovery scan, bruteforce attack and exploit in order to detect vulnerabilities within a user-defined network range Metasploit Pro: This is a versatile and effective application that prevents data breaches with real-world attack scenarios and verifies security effectiveness SecureSafe: A comprehensive online storage solution that allows you to keep your files and passwords protected thanks to a high level of data encryption KPEnhancedEntryView: Enhance the accessibility of KeePass Password Safe by adding extra display elements to your window with this straightforward plugin Zemana AntiLogger: Make sure that your private data will remain private by using this software application that prevents harmful applications from damaging your computer ApexSQL Decrypt: A decryption tool for SQL Server database objects, be them functions, procedures, views or triggers, which enables you to preview the original DDL scripts Reader comments Scam Exploited Safari Bug, Tricked Porn-Viewing iOS Users into Paying Ransom more on: Ransomware i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. Headlines * Advertisers demand Google discounts after YouTube backlash on.ft.com/2nV7wjU * Standard Chartered and Barclays face investor ire over CEO pay on.ft.com/2nV11NQ * Hurricane Energy makes oil discovery west of Shetland Islands on.ft.com/2nUTFK5 * EU looks at revealing negotiating positions for Brexit on.ft.com/2nV8ixd Overview - Advertisers are demanding prime space from Google at discounted prices rates after it was came to light that many brands had appeared next to extremist content on YouTube. Group M's, a part of WPP, Chief Digital Officer Rob Norman said he has been in “constant dialogue with Google” suggesting “a range of actions they may take to give greater comfort and security” to advertisers. - Britain’s leading banks Standard Chartered and Barclays have drawn ire from some big shareholders over decisions to lower hurdles for long-term bonuses for their bosses, in the latest conflict with investors over executive pay. Some leading investors in Standard Chartered and Barclays object to plans to cut the profit triggers for long-term incentive plans to levels below the banks' own stated targets. - Hurricane Energy has made oil discovery west of the Shetland Islands barely days after Royal Dutch Shell and BP won exploration licences in an area the UK is counting on to breathe new life into its struggling oil and gas industry. The company is expected to announce that initial data from its Halifax well indicates the presence of a 1km-deep oil column and it appears to be part of “a single large hydrocarbon accumulation” connected to the its Lancaster field. - Brussels is considering publishing its main negotiating positions in Brexit talks, adopting a policy of full transparency. UK is preparing to trigger the Article 50 divorce clause Wednesday and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is advocating an “open” style similar to the bloc’s conduct in US-EU trade negotiations. This move could increase pressure on May to reveal more of UK strategy in further talks.

The apps that will be featured in here are premium apps on regular days that will be free for the period that they appear in this section.  According to Venture Beat, Google wants to promote more Android apps to users, so it is expanding its Play Store to include a section for a weekly free app. The new feature will not be limited to the smartphone version of the Play Store since it can also be directly accessed via desktop and other mobile devices.  Android Police believes that Google launched this Free App of the Week section because it wants to better highlight the sales of paid apps. The move is also seen as an extension of what Google has implemented late last month that now allows paid apps and games to go on sale for a short period. Google is, after all, testing new sale features for the Play Store. Once a paid app or game is picked up to be the Free App of the Week, it will appear in this section presumably for seven days. The icon will be displayed alongside the name and the star ratings of the application. The price of the app will also be shown, but for the period that it is featured in the section it will have a strikethrough. The word “FREE” is then placed beside it to clearly show users how much they are saving if they are downloading the app within the period that it is there for free.  The Free App of the Week section is already up, and the first free app Android users can take advantage of is Card Wars — Adventure Time from Cartoon Network. The game is up for grabs for $3.99 on regular days, but users can have it for free this week. Should this continue long-term, users will be getting 52 premium apps for free in a year.  Phandroid says that while this feature is not new to Apple given that the Cupertino giant likes to highlight various apps that have just been added to its App Store, this is something new to Google and it’s good news that it is making this kind of approach in promoting premium apps to users.  Google has added a new section to the Play Store that would present users with a free app for the week.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google makes changes to streamline Hangouts, Gmail By Ida Torres - March 26, 2017 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The portfolio of Google products is wide and vast, but can also sometimes be a little confusing as they overlap and cut across each other’s functions. At the recent Google Cloud Next, they made some announcements as to the future of Gmail and Hangouts for businesses and G Suite users. As part of those changes, they are streamlining some of the functions and features of the two apps over the next couple of months to eventually make way for better services later on. One major change for Hangouts is that it will not receive SMS anymore. You will be prompted to switch to another app, like Android Message, which they are positioning as the “primary place to access SMS” on your Android device. You need not worry that switching to a different app from Hangouts will affect previous SMS as all your messages will still be available when you make the switch. The SMS functionality will be turned off by May 22 so you’ll start receiving the notification to choose a new app or service for your messages. Google Talk, which has started losing its meaning and purpose the past few years, will now start to fully transition to Hangouts. If you’re still using this, you will be invited to switch to Hangouts and after June 26 you will not have a choice as you will be automatically transitioned there. So whether you’re using the app on its own or within Gmail, you will have to switch to Hangouts, along with its new features like Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. As Gmail prepares to receive the Gmail Add-Ons feature, some Gmail Labs features will be retired. This includes Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews. . Two legacy features of the Google+ in Gmail will also cease functionality: emailing Google+ profiles and using Google+ Circles. These changes within Gmail will happen by April 24.

The Cabinet ministers warned that companies such as Google and Facebook are acting as a 'conduit' for murderous terrorists, and demanded they be more 'proactive' in tackling the problem. The government is also calling for security services to be given access to encrypted WhatsApp messages, warning it is 'completely unacceptable' that terrorists can plot in secret.  Islamic terrorist Khalid Masood, who was born in Kent as Adrian Elms Focus on the issue has intensified in the wake of the deadly attack on Westminster last week, when Khalid Masood used a hired car to mow down dozens of pedestrians before stabbing a policeman to death at the gates of parliament. Concerns have been raised that information on how to mount a terror attack is still easily accessible online. Before the atrocity Google had already been forced to promise it would take a 'tougher stance' on hateful content after an outcry and boycotts from advertisers over its content appearing alongside extreme material.  Home Secretary Ms Rudd named and shamed lesser known websites like Telegram, Wordpress and Justpaste.it today as she widened the Government's criticism.  The Home Secretary left the door open to changing the law if necessary. But she said she would rather see an industry-wide board doing it independently, as the best people to take action are those who understand the technology and the 'necessary hashtags'.

Share this article Share On encrypted messaging services, she told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'It is completely unacceptable, there should be no place for terrorists to hide. 'We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other. 'It used to be that people would steam-open envelopes or just listen in on phones when they wanted to find out what people were doing, legally, through warrantry. 'But on this situation we need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.' Ms Rudd said she was calling in a 'fairly long list' of relevant organisations for a meeting on the issue this week, including social media platforms. Ms Rudd said she was calling in a 'fairly long list' of relevant internet organisations for a meeting on the issue of extremism this week Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he found it 'disgusting' that net firms were not taking tougher action against extreme literature  'What these companies have to realise is that they are now publishing companies, they are not technology companies, they are platforms and we need to make sure that that (hosting extremist material) stops,' she said. 'You are right, we will not resile from taking action if we need to do so.' But she went on: 'I would rather get a situation where we get all these people around the table agreeing to do it. 'I know it sounds a bit like we're stepping away from legislation but we're not.  'What I'm saying is the best people who understand the technology, who understand the necessary hashtags to stop this stuff even being put up, not just taking it down, but stopping it being put up in the first place, are going to be them.'  Mr Johnson called on internet providers and social media companies to develop new technology to detect and remove jihadist and other extreme material. He accused them of 'not acting when they are tipped off', adding in an interview with the Sunday Times: 'I'm furious about it. 'It's disgusting. 'They need to stop just making money out of prurient violent material.'  Mr Johnson added: 'They are not acting when they are tipped off. Khalid Masood used a hired car to mow down dozens of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before entering the grounds of Parliament and stabbing Pc Keith Palmer to death Theresa May vowed to show terrorists that 'we are not afraid' as she addressed the House of Commons in the wake of the attack 'Evil flourishes when good men do nothing - and that's what's happening here. 'They are putting up adverts next to it.' The interventions come after Prime Minister Theresa May urged internet companies to do more to prevent terror and hate being spread in cyberspace.  An investigation by the Sunday Mirror uncovered a host of messages encouraging extremist violence exchanged on the encrypted Telegram messaging site. They included an image of a sword-bearing jihadi fighter standing in front of a burning Big Ben, sent weeks before Wednesday's terror attack on Parliament. Another reportedly shared details of how to carry out an atrocity, saying: 'Methods can include entering the stadium and detonating an explosive(s). 'Attacking fans/security at full time in the vicinity of the car park area or exits of the stadium. 'Devices can be left in around the stadium, bars, cars, busses, trains, transportation etc. 'Attacks can compromise of explosives, gun attacks, knife, martyrdom vests, CHEMICAL and any other.'   Share or comment on this article e-mail 776 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Dad confronts policewoman who confiscated daffodils from daughters UNC's Luke Maye goes to his 8AM class after beating Kentucky Dramatic moment a car is struck by lightning as it drives down road Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Google-Google+ The cameras on the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL have received plenty of complements. Last year, DxOMark called the Pixel cameras "the best smartphone cameras ever made." The 12MP rear camera uses a Sony IMX378 sensor, and the 8MP selfie snapping shooter sports a Samsung S5K4H8/Omnivision OV8856 sensor. In our review of the Pixel XL, we noted that Google is able to get the most out of these sensors by deploying special software. As it turns out, that special software might be a legacy of Google Glass. Google's issue with the Google Glass camera was its size. While the Search giant was hoping to have a camera on its wearable that matched the quality of smartphone cameras, the sensor used in Glass was smaller than those employed on a handset. That meant that Google engineers had to figure out a way for the smaller sensor to capture enough light so that Glass users wouldn't have to wear a miner's helmet on their head. Eventually, a solution was invented that was called Gcam. Since the hardware couldn't be changed, Google worked on software, and more precisely, the image processing. Gcam is similar to HDR in that multiple shots of the same image are snapped consecutively and then merged together. The theory is that the final picture offers the best of each photo snapped. This is so similar to HDR that on the Pixel, it is called HDR+. The technology is beginning to find its way into other Android devices and Google owned apps like YouTube and Google Photos. What should be interesting will be a comparison of the pictures taken with the Pixel models and those snapped by the upcoming BlackBerry KEYone. The latter will employ the same exact sensors as the Pixel does on both of its cameras. With such a comparison, we can see how much this technology really adds to those high quality snapshots that the Pixel and Pixel XL are known for. source: X via 9to5Google Editor's pick   Samsung Galaxy S8: rumor review   Android O Developer Preview overview: Oh, you'll love it!

Just wrong. Easy to see that it's wrong because the front camera has a pixel pitch of 1.4 micron. posted on 2 days ago, 23:37 0 Reply 2. namdude0373 (Posts: 1; Member since: 2 days ago) I thought I had been misinformed all along when I saw that! The front facing camera has the Sony IMX179 sensor. This happens to be the same selfie shooter on the 6P and the same rear camera on the Nexus 5. Although, I noticed the 6P took a lot better front facing photos than the Nexus 5 did with the rear camera... posted on yesterday, 03:59 0 Reply 3.

You likely have accounts at forums you haven't been to in a decade, and social media services so bereft of users they resemble graveyards. And each and every one of those accounts is a potential avenue into your private life for a hacker. So you need to secure them. These are some of the best ways to keep those accounts secure — and they're all quick and simple to do, so you've got no excuses. 1) Close the accounts you're not using Image: Screenshot Here's what happens to your old, unused accounts on the web: They get hacked. And sometimes they lead the way to the more valuable accounts that you really do care about, so it makes sense to keep the number of accounts you're using down to a minimum. As an added bonus it means you've got fewer usernames and passwords to worry about. 2) Set up a password manager Speaking of usernames and passwords, there are apps that can help out here. Not only do password managers like 1Password or LastPass manage all of your various login credentials for you, they can also generate ultra-secure passwords, saving you from having to remember lots of different ones or resorting to using the same one for everything. 3) Add two-factor verification We've been banging the two-factor verification drum for a while now, and you can set it up on most online accounts, including ones for Apple, Google and Microsoft. It means even if someone gets ahold of your username and password, they won't be able to log into your account on a new device without an extra code delivered over SMS or through an app. Which means they will need physical access to your devices. 4) Protect your password resets Image: Screenshot How easy is it for someone to reset your passwords? If one of your email addresses gets compromised, your social networks could be next, but there are ways to stop this — like checking the Require personal information to reset my password tickbox in Settings on Twitter (under the Account tab), and ensuring your "secret questions" are strong ones. 5) Check your account activity Many of your online accounts let you check up on recent activity — you can head to this page for Facebook and this page for Google, for example — and it's worth doing this regularly to make sure nothing seems amiss. You can typically log out of all sessions but the current one, and revoke account authorizations for any devices you don't recognise. 6) Delete third-party account connections There's nothing inherently wrong with letting other apps and services connect to your Facebook and Twitter, but you should keep these connections to a minimum and remove any you're not using, to block off any potential avenues for hackers to use. You can easily manage your connected apps online for your Google, Twitter and Facebook accounts. 7) Keep your software updated Image: Screenshot Many a vulnerability comes through outdated software, so you should always make sure your operating systems and browsers are right up to date to keep your computer secure and by extension the online accounts you access through them. Thankfully, most software packages now auto-update seamlessly enough, so it's not difficult to stay up to date. 8) Trust no one You'll hear this mantra a lot if you watch X-Files, and it's one you should repeat to yourself whenever you receive an email or social media message with dubious contents. Beware of following links without any context and be aware that phishing scams continue to get smarter and trickier to spot. Think before you click and read up on the latest threats. 9) Get extra help Unless you install something really sketchy and terrible, antivirus programs and other bits of security software can't do any harm and may well do a lot of good — like guarding against the phishing attacks we've just mentioned. There are plenty of good free and paid-for security packages out there for whatever devices you happen to be using. 10) Specify your trusted contacts Image: Screenshot If someone should boot you out of your Facebook account, you can get your friends to let you back in, as long as you tell Facebook who you trust beforehand — go to Security in Settings to set this up. It's simple but effective: Facebook sends your friends one-off codes you can use to regain access, codes which they're told to only pass on to you. 11) Change your passwords regularly If you've got a password manager set up (see above) then this might be taken care of for you but whatever your situation you should be changing your passwords on a regular basis, and we do mean all of them. You've then got much less to worry about should a big batch of them become available to hackers, because you'll likely have changed yours. 12) Use a secret email address If someone knows your email address, they're halfway to knowing how to log into your accounts — and these days it's not that difficult to find out someone's email address. Setting up a private email address (that doesn't really relate to your name) solely for logging into your social media accounts is another way of keeping them more secure. 13) Do you know where your phone is? Image: Screenshot Our mobile phones are gateways to many an online account so you need to keep them well protected. That involves both setting up remote wipe capabilities for if your device gets lost (see the instructions for iOS and Android), and making sure your devices are completely and securely wiped should you be selling them or passing them on. 14) Stay informed One of the easiest but most effective ways of keeping your accounts secure is just to keep up with the tech news — something we can help with. If you know about the latest threats and breaches, and how to deal with them, you won't be caught out. Of course, keeping your active accounts down to a minimum (see the first point) is going to help here too. 15) Install a VPN We've written before about staying safe on public Wi-Fi and if you spend a lot of time in coffee shops or at hotels then the investment in a solid VPN application is well worth it. As well as letting you spoof your location if you need to, it also adds an extra layer of security to the data you're sending and receiving, making it harder for anyone else to listen in. 16) Add PIN code protection Image: Wachiwit/Shutterstock.com A PIN code or password login on your phone or laptop is all that stands in the way of passing strangers and your online accounts, so make sure there's one in place. Whether your devices offer password protection, or fingerprint ID sensing, or facial recognition, or iris scanning, make sure there's something there that stops other people from logging in. 17) Keep your accounts to yourself On a related note, it's well worth setting up your own account on your computer or your browser or your tablet to keep other people away from your important accounts. We're not saying your toddler or your housemate is actively trying to hack into your Facebook but from a security perspective it's always best to limit access as much as possible. 18) Watch what you share online Your accounts are only as secure as the weakest links protecting them — and those links often involve someone impersonating you. Make sure personal details that can be used to verify your identity, like your home address, your birthday, or even what soccer team you support (is that your "secret security question"?) aren't all over your social media profiles.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Wednesday March 29, 2017 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode Holden, Kia pull YouTube ads over video insulting Ita Patrick Hatch 27 Mar 2017, 2:01 p.m. Holden and Kia have suspended all advertising from YouTube after they unwittingly paid to promote their cars alongside an offensive video that directed misogynistic insults at journalist and businesswoman Ita Buttrose. Holden, Kia pull YouTube ads over video insulting Ita The Guide. Ita Buttrose at the Channel 10 studios in Sydney. The longevity of Ita in a business that is notable for people crashing and burning. 19th April 2016. Photo: Steven Siewert Photo: Steven Siewert Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Holden and Kia have suspended all advertising from YouTube after they unwittingly paid to promote their cars alongside an offensive video that directed misogynistic insults at journalist and businesswoman Ita Buttrose. The car makers are joining a slew of major global companies who in recent weeks have boycotted the Google-owned video hosting giant because their ads were appearing before or alongside objectionable content. Holden and Kia pulled the pin on YouTube after it came to light their ads were appearing on a video featuring an interview with "men's rights activist" and author Peter Lloyd on Channel 10's Studio Ten talk show. The video calls Buttrose, a former Australian of the Year, an "old hag", an "old bag" and other explicit misogynistic insults. Holden told Fairfax Media it had decided to pull all advertising from YouTube until it could be confident it would not appear next to objectionable content. "We value our good relationship with Google but in line with General Motor's global response and Holden's diversity stance, we have instructed our media agency to temporarily suspend all advertising on YouTube until we are confident Google can protect our brand from inappropriate or offensive content," a Holden spokesman said. "We'll work closely with our partners at Google to achieve this." A spokesman for Kia Motors Australia said its "programmatic advertising" had been suspended as soon as the company was made aware of the video. "It will remain suspended until such time as we can meet with Google to further clarify the application of this type of advertising," he said. The moves came after major media agencies had said last week they were keeping a close eye on the scandal. Google has been embroiled in a global controversy over ads being placed on objectionable YouTube videos and has scrambled to reassure its customers it can stop them from being associated with anti-semitic, racist and other extremist content. Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Sainsbury's, Toyota, Volkswagen, BBC and the British government have all pulled ads from YouTube in recent weeks. Google's parent company Alphabet's market value fell by $31 billion last week. The story Holden, Kia pull YouTube ads over video insulting Ita first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

News sign-up Google 'can't guarantee' ad safety News, 27 March 2017 Google "can't guarantee" that ads on YouTube - and other platforms it uses to serve client messages - will not appear against inappropriate content, according to a leading executive from the company. Eric Schmidt – the Chairman of Alphabet, the holding group that houses Google – discussed this issue, which has recently seen major US marketers from AT&T to JPMorgan suspend ads on YouTube, during an interview on Fox Business. "We match ads and the content. But because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match," he said. "Because the ads come from everywhere, every once in a while an ad will come in – that someone was trying to sneak it in, if you will – [and] get underneath our rules and violate our terms of service. "So we can't guarantee it, but we can get pretty close." Schmidt outlined some steps the organisation has taken to address this situation. "We've had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time. So I think we're going to be OK," he said. More broadly, the former Google CEO suggested concerns about pairing ads and content – as with fake news – represents a "ranking problem" which requires a certain type of solution. "It should be possible for computers to detect malicious, misleading and incorrect information – and, essentially, have you not see it," he said. "We're not arguing for censorship. We're arguing: just take it off the page. Put it somewhere else. Make it harder to find." Having originated in the UK, the pressure to achieve this aim is rapidly ramping up in the US, where blue-chip marketers like Verizon and Johnson & Johnson have joined the ranks of companies pressing for tighter brand safety measures, along with PepsiCo, Starbucks and Walmart. And Bob Liodice, President/CEO of trade body the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), similarly called for greater protection in this area. "Several" of the ANA's members, he reported, have suspended ads on YouTube and Google websites.  "Their concerns for their brands' well-being is rational, appropriate and warranted. [The] ANA strongly believes that brand safety is of paramount importance to our members. No marketer should ever place its brand at risk," he said. Liodice also linked the debate to wider failings observable across the digital space. "The current crisis is representative of the issues that [the] ANA – and others – have raised with respect to fraud and risk, reduced transparency, sub-optimum measurement and nebulous productivity. A dearth of trust and a need for verification lie at the heart of these problems," he said. According to the Financial Times, GroupM, one of the world's biggest media buyers, is also now demanding premium space on Google properties at a discounted price. Rob Norman, Chief Digital Officer for GroupM, said that "constant dialogue with Google" had included the possibility of reduced rates for premium advertising inventory to offer brands more security and avoid them appearing next to inappropriate YouTube content. An equity research team at Liberum, the investment and brokerage firm, estimates that over 250 advertisers have now pulled their ads from YouTube.   Data sourced from Fox Business, ANA, MediaPost; additional content by Warc staff Sign up for daily news Latest News Vietnamese FMCG brands squeezed out News Newsbrands' context drives profit for advertisers News Global internet adspend to pass TV Opinion Life after adtech?

A proposed plan is to force the company to replace all of its customers’ certificates and to stop recognising the extended validation (EV) status of those that have it. According to a Netcraft survey from 2015, Symantec is responsible for about one in every three SSL certificates used on the web, making it the largest commercial certificate issuer in the world. As a result of acquisitions over the years the company now controls the root certificates of several formerly standalone certificate authorities including VeriSign, GeoTrust, Thawte and RapidSSL. SSL/TLS certificates are used to encrypt the connections between browsers and HTTPS-enabled websites and also to verify that users are actually visiting the websites they intended to and not spoofed versions. These certificates are issued by organisations known as certificate authorities that are trusted by default in browsers and operating systems. The process of issuing and managing certificates is governed by rules created by the CA/Browser Forum, an organization whose members include browser vendors and certificate authorities. When those rules are violated, browser and OS vendors can revoke trust in the offending certificates and sanction the responsible certificate authorities, going as far as kicking them out of their root certificate stores. Google said that an investigation into a recent incident indicates that Symantec has not upheld security practices expected of certificate authorities, such as validating domain control, auditing logs for evidence of unauthorised issuance, and minimizing the ability for the issuance of fraudulent certificates.

This will be a gradual process where every new Chrome release will distrust a new batch of certificates starting with Chrome 59, which will revoke trust in certificates that have a validity period of over 33 months. This will put enormous pressure on Symantec, as the company will have to contact all customers, validate their identity and the ownership of their domains all over again, and replace their existing certificates with new ones, most likely at no cost. Some companies will likely have problems replacing their certificates on such short notice, as they might be used in payment terminals and other hard-to-reach embedded devices. Read more Microsoft is playing Windows hardball In addition to that, Symantec might have to refund customers who paid for EV certificates that will no longer be recognised as such in Chrome, since their value would be significantly reduced - the ban on Symantec EV certificates will last for at least one year. All replacement certificates issued by Symantec to customers will need to have a validity period of nine months or less in order to be trusted in Chrome. This is likely to cause further problems for some large companies, which won't be able to easily replace their certificates every nine months. It's safe to say that Google's sanctions might have a significant impact on Symantec's SSL business, as the company is likely to lose customers who won't be willing to put up with these restrictions and will take their business to a different certificate authority (CA). Browser vendors have punished CAs before for improperly issuing certificates -- or "misissuing" them, in industry parlance -- but never on this scale and with an impact so large on the ecosystem. Read more ​Citrix may be selling, but is Microsoft buying? Some people have always wondered if browser vendors can really take drastic sanctions against the world's largest CAs, or whether those authorities are simply too big to fail. The reason for this unprecedented punishment seems to be repeated incidents of misissued certificates at Symantec that have come to light over the past few years, some of which the company failed to identify on its own despite internal and external audits. The latest case was uncovered this year and involved 127 certificates issued with bogus information or without proper domain ownership verification by a Symantec partner that operated as a registration authority (RA). According to Google, that investigation calls into question the validity of at least 30,000 certificates issued by Symantec partners over a period spanning several years. However, Symantec disputes that number. Read more ​Exeed partners with vGRID to offer channel cloud services "Symantec allowed at least four parties access to their infrastructure in a way to cause certificate issuance, did not sufficiently oversee these capabilities as required and expected, and when presented with evidence of these organizations’ failure to abide to the appropriate standard of care, failed to disclose such information in a timely manner or to identify the significance of the issues reported to them," Google's Ryan Sleevi said in a post on the Chrome development mailing list. This and past incidents have led Google to "no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years," Sleevi said. Symantec strongly objected to Google's plan and criticized its publication. It also described Google's remarks about the company's past misissuances as "exaggerated and misleading." "This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible," the company said in a blog post Friday. "We hope it was not calculated to create uncertainty and doubt within the Internet community about our SSL/TLS certificates." Read more ​How Kiwi partners can maximise Microsoft Teams The claim about the 30,000 certficates is not true and the 127 certificates that have been confirmed as misissued did not result in any consumer harm, Symantec said, adding that the relationship with the partner responsible for the incident has been terminated and that its entire RA program has been discontinued. "While all major CAs have experienced SSL/TLS certificate mis-issuance events, Google has singled out the Symantec Certificate Authority in its proposal even though the mis-issuance event identified in Google’s blog post involved several CAs," Symantec said. The company will work to minimise any potential disruption caused by Google's proposal if it goes forward, but is open to discussing the matter with Google and finding a mutually agreed-on solution. Meanwhile, Mozilla, which manages its own root certificate program, is also considering sanctions for Symantec and might have to align them with Google's. "Now that Google have announced their action, it is unavoidable to note that it can be preferable for two root stores considering action against a CA to take broadly parallel approaches, so that the CA is not doubly penalised for the same actions," Mozilla's Gervase Markham wrote on the organisation's security policy mailing list. However, Markham noted that Google's plan is "at the strong end" of the options he was considering and that calibrating the level of response, which has to take into account previous precedents and sanctions against other CAs, is a difficult process.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images "Dad, what happens when you die?" "I don't know, son. Nobody knows for sure." "Why don't you ask Google?" Of course, Google isn't clever enough to tell us whether there is life after death, but the word "google" does crop up in conversation more often than either "clever" or "death", according to researchers at the UK's University of Lancaster. It took just two decades for Google to reach this cultural ubiquity, from its humble beginnings as a student project at Stanford University in California. It is hard to remember just how bad search technology was before Google. In 1998, for example, if you typed "cars" into Lycos - then a leading search engine - you would get a results page filled with porn websites. Why? Owners of porn websites inserted many mentions of popular search terms such as "cars" in tiny text or in white on a white background. The Lycos algorithm saw many mentions of "cars", and concluded the page would be interesting to someone searching for "cars". In the Google era, this seems almost laughably simplistic. But Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were not, initially, interested in designing a better way to search. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sergey Brin (L) and Larry Page (R) were trying to map the credibility of academic papers when they devised Google Their Stanford project had a more scholarly motivation. In academia, how often a published paper is cited is a measure of its credibility, and if it is cited by papers that themselves are cited many times, that bestows even more credibility. Mr Page and Mr Brin realised that if they could find a way to analyse all the links on the nascent world wide web, they could rank the credibility of each web page in any given subject. To do this, they first had to download the entire internet. This caused some consternation. It gobbled up nearly half of Stanford's bandwidth. Irate webmasters showered the university with complaints that Google's crawler was overloading their servers. More from Tim Harford Why the falling cost of light matters How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream How the invention of paper changed the world But as Mr Page and Mr Brin refined their algorithm, it became clear they had discovered a vastly better way to search the web. Porn websites with tiny text saying "cars cars cars" don't get many links from other websites that discuss cars. If you searched Google for "cars", its analysis would be likely to yield results about… cars. Mr Page and Mr Brin quickly attracted investors, and Google went from student project to private company. It is now among the world's biggest, bringing in profits by the tens of billions. But for the first few years, Mr Page and Mr Brin burned through money without knowing how or if they would make it back. They were not alone. During the dotcom boom, shares in loss-making internet companies traded at absurd prices, in anticipation that they would eventually figure out viable business models. Speed and transparency Google found its model in 2001: pay-per-click advertising. Advertisers pay Google when someone clicks through to their website, having searched for specified terms. Google displays the highest-bidders' ads alongside its "organic" search results. From an advertiser's perspective, the appeal is clear: you pay only when you reach people who have demonstrated an interest in your offering. It is much more efficient than paying to advertise in a newspaper. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Newspapers have seen a significant decline in display advertising Even if its readership matches your target demographic, inevitably most people who see your newspaper advert won't be interested in what you are selling. No wonder newspaper advertising revenue has fallen off a cliff. The media's scramble for new business models is one obvious economic impact of Google search. But the invention of functional search technology has created value in many ways. A few years ago, McKinsey tried to list the most important. One is timesaving. Studies suggest that googling is about three times as quick as finding information in a library, even discounting the time spent getting there. Likewise, finding a business online is about three times faster than using a printed directory such as the Yellow Pages. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Traditional directories such as the Yellow Pages have struggled to compete with online search tools McKinsey put the productivity gains of this into the hundreds of billions. Another benefit is price transparency - economist jargon for being able to stand in a shop, take out your phone, google a product you're thinking of buying and seeing if it's available more cheaply elsewhere, then using that knowledge to haggle - annoying for the shop, helpful for the customer. Then there are "long tail" effects. In physical shops, it makes no sense to display aisle after aisle of obscure products that will be bought only rarely - they focus on a limited range of bestsellers instead. Natural monopoly? But a decent search facility makes it easy to find a needle in the product haystack, and that has enabled the rise of online shops offering more variety. Customers with specific desires are more likely to find exactly what they want, rather than settling for the nearest thing available in the local supermarket. And entrepreneurs can launch niche products, more confident they will find a market. This all sounds like excellent news for consumers and businesses.

You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. But there is a problem. Google dominates the search market, handling close to 90% of searches worldwide. Many businesses rely on ranking highly in its organic search results. And Google constantly tweaks the algorithm that decides them. Google gives general advice about how to do well, but it is not transparent about how it ranks results - not least because that would give away the information necessary to game the system. We would be back to searching for cars and getting porn. Image copyright Google Image caption Google explains how its search works in principle but guards the details of its all-important algorithms You don't have to look far online (thanks, Google) to find business owners and search strategy consultants gnashing their teeth over the company's power to make or break them. If Google thinks you are employing tactics it considers unacceptable, it will downgrade you. One blogger complains that Google is "judge, jury and executioner". "You get penalised on suspicion of breaking the rules, [and] you don't even know what the rules are," they say. Trying to figure out how to please Google's algorithm is rather like trying to appease an omnipotent, capricious and ultimately unknowable god. You may say as long as Google's top results are useful to searchers, it's tough luck on those who rank lower - and if those results stop being useful, then some other pair of students at Stanford will spot the gap in the market and dream up a better way. Right? Maybe - or maybe not. Search was a competitive business in the late 1990s. But now, it may be a natural monopoly - in other words, an industry that is extremely hard for a second entrant to succeed in. The reason? Among the best ways to improve the usefulness of search results is to analyse which links were ultimately clicked by people who previously performed the same search, as well as what the user has searched for before. Google has far more of that data than anyone else. That suggests the company may continue to shape our access to knowledge for generations to come.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Google Play gets a Free App of the Week section Emil Protalinski@EPro March 26, 2017 3:42 PM Tags: Google, google play, Google Play Store, top-stories Google has added a new section to the Google Play store to promote a free app every week. If you can’t see it in your Play store (I certainly don’t get it on my phone), you can access it directly, both on desktop and on mobile, by clicking the following link: Free App of the Week. Android Police first spotted the new collection of apps and games by scrolling down on the Apps page of the Play store. As its name suggests, the section is supposed to highlight one item per week, with the sale presumably ending after seven days. It’s not clear how the featured selection is made nor what happens after the week is over, but the app likely returns to its original pricing. As outlined, the Google Play collection should only ever show one item at any given point. This week it’s Card Wars – Adventure Time (which normally costs $3), while last week it was Ultimate Guitar Tabs & Chords (price is $3 again). This is a great way to promote apps and games without overloading the user. I don’t bother going through the top charts, nor do I have time to check Google Play’s Editors’ Choice section on a frequent basis, but I’m pretty sure I can go through 52 selections in a year. I have no interest in getting a card game so I’ve already dismissed this week’s offer, but I can’t help be curious about what next week will bring. We have contacted Google about this new promotion and will update you if we hear back. Update at 9:10 p.m. Pacific: Article has been corrected to reflect that the Free App of the Week did not originate this week but actually started last week. Thanks for the tip Adrian! Update on March 27: “We are always making improvements to Google Play to offer to the best service possible to our consumers,” a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat. A source close to the company informed us that this is a four week pilot in the U.S. (even though it does appear to work outside the country if you follow the direct link). Either way, don’t get too accustomed to the promotion as it may not last more than a month. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

But while this means we’re getting more and more desktop class apps on our phones, getting mobile apps on our desktops is as hard as ever. Unless you use a Chromebook 12 Android Apps You Need to Install on Chromebook 12 Android Apps You Need to Install on Chromebook With the Google Play store about to come to our fingertips, the power of an incredible number of apps is about to reach Chrome OS. So what will we install first? Let's see. Read More . But what if you use a Mac? It is possible to run Android apps on macOS. You’ll need some third-party software, and you’ll need to be willing to spend a few moments setting it up. Once you’re done, you’ll even have access to the Google Play Store. In this guide, we’ll take a look at the best solution — VirtualBox — along with a few other methods you might want to explore. VirtualBox The best way to run Android apps on your Mac is to install a full version of the Android operating system itself. You can do this using the free VirtualBox software 3 Websites To Download Virtual Disk Images For VirtualBox 3 Websites To Download Virtual Disk Images For VirtualBox Virtual machines are more useful than just for fun and games, and they've helped me a huge deal in work-related areas of my life. Using a virtual machine offers a great sandbox if you're ever... Read More and a build of Android that has been developed for computers with Intel processors. Before you get started, then, download VirtualBox and the x86 build of Android. The most recent version supported is Marshmallow. Download: VirtualBox (Free) Download: x86 build of Android (Free) The process is straightforward, but there are quite a few steps involved. If you aren’t fully up to speed with virtual machines, partitions, file systems and the like, don’t worry. We’ll skip the technical explanations — just follow the instructions to get up and running. Set Up VirtualBox Install VirtualBox and then launch it. From the main screen, click New and enter a name for your virtual machine (you can just call it Android). Under Type, select Linux, and for Version, choose Other Linux (64-bit). Then click Continue. You can keep the defaults for the next few screens. Click Continue to accept them for the Memory Size, Hard Disk, and Hard Disk File Type settings. Under Storage on Physical Hard Disk select Fixed Size, which can give you a small speed boost, and click Continue. The next screen is File Location and Size. Click the folder icon to choose where you want to save your new virtual hard disk — or just keep the default option. Stick with the recommended size for the disk as well, then click Create. Your virtual machine is now set up, and you need to install Android on it. Back in the main window select the Android VM and click Start. Next select the Android ISO file that you downloaded earlier and click Start. You’re now ready to install the operating system, or you can run it without installing. This is slower and doesn’t enable you to save your setup. If you plan to use the operating system more than once, it’s best to install it. The mouse doesn’t work for the next few options, so use the cursor keys on your keyboard to highlight your chosen option and hit Enter to select it. Install Android The first part of the process is to create a virtual partition on your hard drive. This is where Android will be installed. On the next screen, choose Create/Modify Partitions, followed by No. Next, select New to create a new partition, then Primary, then hit Enter to accept the size. Finally, highlight Bootable and hit Enter again. The word Boot should have appeared under Flag in the table above. Once this is done, use the cursor keys to scroll over to Write and press Enter. You can ignore the warning about the partition destroying data on your disk — you aren’t creating an actual partition, just a large file that will function as one. Type “yes” to get started. Once that is complete scroll over to Quit and hit Enter. You’ll now see the Choose Partition screen, with your newly created virtual partition listed at the top. The next step is to install Android on this partition. Select the partition and choose OK to begin. On the next screen, select ext4 under Choose File System, then hit Yes to confirm on the next screen. The partition will then be formatted. Next, you’ll be asked if you want to install the boot loader. Choose Yes, then select Skip on the next screen. When prompted to install the /system directory as read/write, choose Yes. Android will now begin installing. When it has finished, you’ll be prompted to run Android. Hit Enter, and it will boot in its own window on your desktop.

You can control it with your mouse — you may need to go to Input > Mouse Integration (and deselect it) to get it working — but multi-touch controls are off limits. Hit Cmd + F to go full screen. Enter the details for your Google account, and you’ll have full access to the Play Store. You can also download apps through the browser and sideload them. Not every app will work, and not all of them will work perfectly, but you should hopefully be able to get most of your favorites up and running. A Few Other Methods VirtualBox is the best way to get Android apps working on macOS. There are a few other options you can look into, although they’re less effective and, in some cases, no longer supported. Android Studio The Android SDK How to Set Up Android Studio on Your Mac (And Why You'd Want to) How to Set Up Android Studio on Your Mac (And Why You'd Want to) You might need a Mac in order to create your own iOS apps, but if you're more of a green alien sort of guy, Android Studio is also available. Read More comes with a full emulator for the Android operating system, and it comes with the main benefit of always being fully up to date. However, it’s not intended as a method for running any app on your desktop — it’s for quickly testing apps you’ve built yourself. As such, installing apps is not easy, and the performance is far from great — the emulator is notoriously slow. Plus, installing the full Studio software is probably overkill for what most users are looking to achieve.

The BlueStacks AppPlayer is free, fast, and very easy to set up. It also works with a large array of apps and games. If you visit bluestacks.com from your Mac, you’ll be prompted to download and install a version of this software for MacOS computers. Unfortunately, the software is not currently supported and no longer works.

ARC Welder Chrome apps are also no longer officially supported outside of Chrome OS. However, you can still download them. ARC Welder is an old app that runs in the Chrome browser on a Mac that enables you to run Android apps within. It’s still worth testing, but it’s slow and support for apps seems to be very hit or miss. It isn’t a long term solution either, since the lack of support means it’s likely to eventually stop working altogether. Did You Get Android Running on Your Mac? For most users, VirtualBox is the way to go. Although the instructions might seem complex, it only takes a few minutes to get working. And the integration with the Play Store makes it easy to get your favorite apps on your Mac. Do you run Android apps on macOS? How have you found the experience?

Reply Rich September 18, 2012 at 3:24 am Simon, this is a great tutorial. I wasn't clear on one thing though. Are these 2 types of solutions independent of each other? (Virtualbox vs AndroidSDK?) So if I want to download Android Apps I'd go with OPtion 2 only right?

VirtualBox: - Download and install VirtualBox. - Download and extract the Android VirtualBox image from this page. - Open the extracted 'Android-v4.vbox' in VirtualBox. - In VirtualBox, press 'Start'. The necessary configuration of the Android SDK should be already covered in the article, but feel free to ask for help if you're stuck anywhere. BlueStacks can just be installed, and used out of the box. Hope that helps you along. If not, let me know. :-) Reply Sohel Zaman July 16, 2012 at 6:29 pm Absolutely helpful..!! It's some material that i've been searching for a while to play my favorite apps in mac. Thanks for posting this. Reply Simon Slangen July 20, 2012 at 7:21 pm Glad to help! Which particular solution did you end up choosing? Reply Choon Khai July 11, 2012 at 6:47 pm I wondered if there's iPhone version? Windows one maybe? I only used iPhone 3G so far, and some apps painfully hard to use because it uses a lot of memory which my iPhone can't accommodate. Reply Simon Slangen July 20, 2012 at 7:04 pm I don't think there's any decent way to do this on iOS right now, but Chris Hoffman did write similar article for Windows. Hope that helps. Reply Choon Khai July 31, 2012 at 8:08 am Thanks! It helps :) Reply gpvprasad July 10, 2012 at 10:11 am Please also tell me how you created the virtual box image. Reply Simon Slangen July 20, 2012 at 7:00 pm I didn't create the virtualbox image myself, but used a prebuilt one. I actually linked to it in the article, but here it is again for reference. :-) Reply Tom Sobieski July 10, 2012 at 1:58 am I would want to do this because? Reply Sylwia July 10, 2012 at 9:20 am Because an app might not have a desktop version, not even web version, and sometimes it is easier to use keyboard to enter a lot of data.

Name: Subject: Message: The Pixel’s camera software has its origins in Google Glass Newsby Edgar Cervantes2 days ago 23 1486 14 The Google Pixel has been praised for many reasons, but it is especially popular for its camera quality. The Search Giant has gone from having the worst cameras in the industry to offering some of the best. How did they accomplish this? It turns out part of what makes the Pixel’s camera so good is that it adopts software originally made for Google Glass. See also: Google Pixel XL review: a Pixel’s perspective October 27, 2016 Google Glass was a very interesting project in its time. In terms of photography, users had the advantage of easy access to a first-person point of view. This was taken advantage of by casual users, doctors and even the porn industry (among others). There was a slight problem during its development, though. Google wanted the Glass camera to be on par with smartphone technology, a difficult accomplishment due to restrictions in sensor, lens and overall size. It was a smaller camera, which usually results in sacrificed light intake, which means worse photos. Alphabet’s X decided to take this issue back to the drawing board and came up with a solution that later became known as Gcam. The trick was to improve photography without improving hardware, which they did by using better software techniques during image processing. The team used a method called “image fusion”, in which the camera takes multiple shots in a row, only to merge them together and get the best out of each photo. This will sound very familiar if you have a basic knowledge of photography – it is much like HDR. In fact, it is labeled as HDR+ in the Google Pixel’s camera options. Google’s camera technology has also started reaching other Android devices, YouTube, Google Photos and Jump (360-degree rig). In the future, Google aims to use machine learning to improve white balance and let the software decide what to do with the background (blur, darken, lighten, etc.). Maybe Google Glass was a success after all, right? Just not in the way Google hoped it would be.

"We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn't align with their values," Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler said in a post on the internet giant's blog. "So starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content." (READ: Google starts weeding out hateful, violent content from search results) The move came a day after an apology by a senior Google executive following the British government and a handful of top firms including Marks and Spencer and HSBC bank pulling their adverts after they appeared alongside extremist content on its internet platforms, particularly its video-sharing site YouTube. The British arm of Havas, one of the world's top advertising agencies that manages the accounts of numerous leading firms, suspended such advertising last week. Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, are the BBC, Guardian newspaper group and McDonalds UK. The British government put its YouTube advertising on hold on Monday, saying "it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content -- and that message was conveyed very clearly to Google." A Marks and Spencer spokesman said: "In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through." The Times reported last week that BBC programs were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as videos by Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from the UK for inciting hatred. The newspaper said an analysis it conducted found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the EU when it anonymously signalled their presence. 'Hard look' at content Schindler said in his post that Google "is taking a hard look at our existing community guidelines to determine what content is allowed on" YouTube, and will tighten safeguards to ensure that ads show up only against legitimate creators. A boycott by firms worried about damaging their image could cause serious harm to Google as advertising makes up the overwhelming majority of the internet giant's revenue. Unaudited figures from Google's parent company Alphabet indicated that advertising accounted for nearly 86% of the company's $26.1 billion in revenues in the final quarter of last year. Schindler said Google acknowledged that companies have brand guidelines which dictate where and when they want their ads to appear, and that it wants to give them more control to do that. "In the coming days and months, we're introducing new tools for advertisers to more easily and consistently manage where their ads appear across YouTube and the web," said Schindler. He pledged Google would hire significant numbers of people and harness its latest developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to review questionable content for advertising. He added the firm would be able to resolve cases of advertising appearing alongside inappropriate content "in less than a few hours". – Rappler.com Filed under:Google and advertising•Philipp Schindler•advertising•Google HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Mark Beach/Fresco News/Reuters | Caption Loading... J Walker Glascock March 26, 2017 —Uber announced that it is suspending its autonomous vehicle program following a serious crash on the streets of Tempe, Ariz., involving one of the company’s self-driving Volvos, serving as the latest major setback to the beleaguered ride-hailing startup that has had a difficult several weeks. From harassment allegations and reports of cocaine use on a company retreat to accusations of intellectual property theft and a string of departures by top-level executives, the period beginning mid-February may represent the beginning of the downward spiral for what was once one of the world’s most promising startups. Beginning on February 19 when Susan Fowler, a former engineer for the company published a post on her website calling attention to the gender bias and sexual harassment she faced while working for Uber. In her post, she described in detail how her claims were dismissed and she was subsequently threatened with termination after she reported sexual harassment to Uber's human resources department. While her allegations were immediately addressed by CEO Travis Kalanick, hiring the former US Attorney General Eric Holder to assist in the internal investigation, a report by the New York Times mere days later demonstrated her claims may not have been isolated. The New York Times article alleged that during a 2015 company meeting in Las Vegas, a manager groped multiple employees (that manager was terminated within 12 hours) while other employees were doing cocaine in the bathrooms at private parties. Do you belong on the road? Take our driver's test. On February 23, Google, one of Uber’s investors, filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing startup over intellectual property theft, alleging that the team developing Uber’s autonomous vehicle program had directly taken Waymo’s (the name of Google’s self-driving car group) technology to “avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology” according to documents filed in court in San Francisco. For their part, Uber denied any wrongdoing with an Uber spokeswoman telling CNBC that they “take the allegations made against… Uber employees seriously" and "will review this matter carefully.” Barely had the dust settled from that Thursday’s courtroom filings when, the following Monday Amit Singhal, Uber’s Senior Vice President of Engineering, stepped down after a reporter for Recode alerted the company to the fact that Singhal had left his former position at Google because of sexual harassment allegations. Once notified, Kalanick immediately requested Singhal’s resignation, however coming less than ten days after Ms. Fowler’s allegations against another Uber employee that reporting didn’t help the company's overall public image. Further complicating Uber’s public relations issues came one day later when a video surfaced of Mr. Kalanick getting involved in an angry argument with an Uber driver over recent rate drops. Following the video’s release, Kalanick issued an apology for his behavior and admitted his need for leadership help. That was on February 28th. On March 3rd, The New York Times published a piece of investigative reporting detailing how Uber used a tool called Greyball to effectively avoid authorities in locations where the ride-hailing services were under contest or banned altogether, such as in cities like Boston, Paris, and Las Vegas. Pulling data collected by the app as well as other methods to identify city officials, Uber would alert drivers and then deliver a “a fake version of the app, populated with ghost cars, to evade capture”, according to The New York Times article. The same day that The New York Times article was released, Uber’s Vice President of Growth and Development, Ed Baker, suddenly resigned after three years with the company. While his expressed intention was to move to the public sector, Mr. Baker had been peripherally involved in the sexual harassment and sexism allegations at Uber as he had previously been witnessed engaging in a sexual activity with another employee at a work event in Miami, according to Recode. March 17th saw information leaked that demonstrated slow progress in Uber’s autonomous vehicle program. The data showed that the self-driving vehicles travelled independently only for about 0.8 miles before a human driver was forced to takeover. Contrasted with Google’s Waymo, where the automated system was being disengaged on average once every 5,000 miles. Two days later Uber’s president Jeff Jones left abruptly, saying "the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided [his] career are inconsistent with what [he] saw and experienced at Uber,” according to Business Insider. Following Mr. Jones’ departure, Uber stated their expressed desire to turn around their image. But on Friday, reports surfaced that Kalanick and other Uber managers visited an "escort bar" in Seoul in which they selected women wearing numbered tags out of a lineup.  Now comes the crash in Tempe and the suspension of the company’s autonomous vehicle program.

Musk is truly a king of innovation, sharing the stage with other entrepreneurial giants as Sir Richard Branson, Oprah, Steve Jobs, Henry Ford and Walt Disney, to name a few. The quality of life as we know it wouldn’t be the same without these entrepreneurs. The value they add to our lives is priceless, from entertainment to travel to technology. Though most entrepreneurs have vastly different perspectives on how to run business or conduct leadership, one thread unites them all: innovation. There’s a lot more to innovation than just thinking differently. You have to lay the groundwork first. The following are a few simple examples that will help you think differently: Think Differently Tech innovators are the rebels of the business world. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify them, or vilify them. But the one thing you can’t do is ignore them. That’s what makes these leaders a force to be reckoned with in their respective industries. Those who think differently push us to be greater, which to some may be perceived as “crazy.” Simply put, the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are usually the ones who do. But before you can truly think differently, you have to build a foundation, and that starts with a unique vision. Having vision requires thinking well beyond the basic idea. Think of the creators of Google: in the late 1990s, while doctoral students at Stanford, Larry Page and Sergey Brin launched the search engine Google with a single vision – to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. In turn, Google has become one of the most profitable companies of the 21st Century. The vision here appeared far-fetched back then, but think about where Google is now. Businesses can’t survive without an online presence on Google. Your startup may not have that massive Google appeal from a product or service standpoint, but don’t let that slow your vision – even the ideas you think are truly crazy. Get Passionate Vision can’t flourish without passion. Sir Richard Branson describes passion perfectly: “There is no greater thing you can do with your life and your work than follow your passion in a way that serves the world and you.” The more passionate one is about solving a problem or achieving a result, the more likely one will be successful, whether that means trying to figure out how to internationalize Disney-owned content or developing strategies to reach and engage a younger audience on mobile. For those involved in startups, a study in the psychology of innovation will provide a smoother path to successful entrepreneurship. This out-of-the-box thinking has helped me build my company into a top online travel agency. Practice these lessons daily to grow your innovative side. Your business (and personal life) will surely benefit from it.

It made me wonder if I need one at all. So I asked Kimber Streams, who tests laptops at The Wirecutter, a product reviews website owned by The New York Times, for some advice. For people who basically use their laptop to browse the web and send email, is there a cheap option? Definitely. For those people, I recommend a Chromebook. It’s a laptop in the traditional sense, but it runs Chrome OS, a lighter operating system by Google that’s basically just a web browser. And you can get a great one for around $400. A Windows laptop that’s just as good costs at least $500, and they tend to be bigger and heavier, with worse battery life. With a Chromebook, can I use all the Google apps and store documents and spreadsheets on Google Drive? Yes. Google’s apps (which I use all the time for work) can open spreadsheets and documents, including those created in Microsoft Office. And most Chromebooks come with 100 gigabytes of free Google Drive storage for two years. Chromebooks encourage people to store documents in the cloud, because the machines have very little local storage (usually about 32 gigabytes). Microsoft also offers Office 365, a way to access Word, Excel and such on the web, if you need to use those particular programmes. What’s the cheapest Chromebook to buy and what do you recommend? There are $200 Chromebooks, but we don’t recommend them because they usually have 2 gigabytes of memory and poor processors, which means you can’t have more than a couple of tabs open and everything loads very slowly. They’re truly painful to use, even for light browsing. Our top pick, the Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Chromebook, is $430, and our budget pick, the Dell Chromebook 3380 Education, costs $300. That one is fast enough, but it has a shallow keyboard and a dim, low-resolution screen. Even so, it’s the cheapest viable Chromebook. I always wondered why these things can’t run the apps that can run on phones, so I can do more things with them. Well, Google’s working on that! But it’s pretty rough around the edges right now. Google perpetually updates Chrome OS, so it’s possible apps will improve over the next couple of years. When I buy a laptop, do I still need to be concerned about specs? Yes, but only a little bit. Right now, a Chromebook shouldn’t have fewer than four gigabytes of memory, and a Celeron processor. A Windows laptop for everyday work needs at least 8 gigs, and we recommend a Core i3 or Core i5 processor and a solid-state drive. For gaming or video editing, you’ll need 16 gigabytes of memory, at least a Core i5 or i7 processor, a dedicated graphics card and a solid-state drive. Processors aren’t improving as quickly as before, so any of the past few generations are fine, as long as they’re Core i processors. If I still need a real laptop, what should I be thinking about? Do you even recommend the best cheap Windows machine? Not really. Chances are, if all you need is a cheap laptop, then a Chromebook would work just as well and offer better performance. If you have only $500 to spend, then the cheap Windows laptop is your only option. It’ll do everything you need it to, but it’s large, bulky and has poor quality. If possible, I highly encourage people to save up an additional $200 or so and get the budget pick from our review of the best Windows ultrabooks: the Asus ZenBook UX330UA. It’s thin, lightweight, has excellent quality and battery life, and costs only $750. It’s an amazing computer for the price. It’s so good that we seriously discussed whether to recommend it over the Dell XPS 13, which has been our best Windows ultrabook since it was introduced in early 2015. We ultimately decided that Dell’s superior trackpad, Thunderbolt 3 support and portability made it worth the splurge if you can swing it, but the ZenBook is still a great option.

The bet paid off. YouTube is now one of the pillars of Google’s advertising business and the most valuable video platform on the Internet. In recent years, advertisers, unable to ignore its massive audience, flocked to YouTube to reach younger people who have started to shun traditional broadcast television. But the technology underpinning YouTube’s advertising business has come under intense scrutiny in recent days, with AT&T, Johnson & Johnson and other deep-pocketed marketers announcing that they would pull their ads from the service. Their reason: The automated system in which ads are bought and placed online has too often resulted in brands appearing next to offensive material on YouTube such as hate speech. Recently, the ride-sharing service Lyft became the latest example, removing their ads after they appeared next to videos from a racist skinhead group. “This is beyond offensive,” a Lyft spokesman, Scott Coriell, said. “As soon as we learned of it, we pulled our advertising on YouTube.” The pullback from advertisers strikes at the core of YouTube’s appeal. Unlike television, with specific programming during which brands choose to run their advertising, YouTube mirrors the Internet’s sprawl, specialising in niche content that may not appeal to a mainstream audience but attracts engaged viewers. This provides YouTube with an enormous audience watching one billion hours of videos a day, perfect for new ad technology that minutely slices and dices an audience so that companies can target specific viewers. Use of automation That technology, known as programmatic advertising, allows advertisers to lay out the general parameters of what kind of person they want to reach — say, a young man under 25 — and trust that their ad will find that person, no matter where he might be on the Internet. This approach plays to the strengths of tech giants like Google and Facebook, allowing advertisers to use automation and data to cheaply and efficiently reach their own audiences, funneling money through a complicated system of agencies and third-party networks. But more than 400 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and while Google has noted that it prevents ads from running near inappropriate material “in the vast majority of cases,” it has proved unable to totally police that amount of content in real time. “The simple truth is that the same tech that allows the posting of a recipe, the joyous video of a child or the exposure of an excessive act from law enforcement allows the creation, posting or sharing of the video of a murder,” Rob Norman, chief digital officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, wrote this week in Campaign, a trade publication. Marketers have seen programmatic advertising as a groundbreaking development in media — a technologically efficient way to leverage the expanse of the Internet so that, for example, Pampers can reach a new mom on a local blog or an instructional video about how to deal with a newborn’s baby acne. This has opened up the whole of the Internet to brands, which typically opt to remove their ads after they have appeared on unsavory sites, rather than restrict the ads to a list of preapproved locations. That sheer scale, coupled with its reliance on algorithms rather than humans to filter out the objectionable content after it appears, has been Google’s main defense. More than two million websites are a part of its display advertising network. “What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match. We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time, and so I think we’re going to be OK,” Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said. While brands have expressed concern about showing up next to unsavory photos and videos uploaded to digital platforms by users, the situation with YouTube is particularly jarring. YouTube splits advertising revenue with its users, meaning advertisers risk directly funding creators of hateful, misogynistic or terrorism-related content. There’s a lot at stake for YouTube and Alphabet. Search advertising is not growing as fast as it once did, and television ad budgets are still larger than total spending on digital advertising. YouTube and Facebook have made no secret of their desire for television advertising funds. James Dix, a senior media analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that YouTube accounted for revenue of about $13 billion, or roughly 20% of all advertising revenue on Google’s Internet properties in 2016. “If this company is going to look for new growth at scale, it has to pull money from television,” Dix said.

STRATEGY Why Facebook's Snapchat Clone Is a Master Class in Disruption It's often said that "you need to skate to where the puck is going." Learn to love disruption and you'll never get tired of that puck chase. By Allen Lau Allen Lau is the co-founder and CEO of Wattpad, a global multi-platform entertainment company for original stories. He is a serial entrepreneur with a passion for mobile technology. @allenlau Co-founder and CEO, Wattpad@allenlau WRITE A COMMENT Mark Zuckerberg (center), co-founder and CEO of Facebook. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The media is obsessed with Facebook's rollout of Snapchat-like features, and what they mean for the two companies. It's easy to see why--competition creates drama, and drama commands attention. Facebook versus Google Plus. Periscope versus Meerkat. Foursquare versus Gowalla. Each major advancement in technology brings a wave of disruption that can level any playing field. Every business is a target for disruption. Right now, someone's coding a product or service that may fundamentally change the way you do business. In my decades of experience in the tech industry, I've come away with a better understanding of why businesses go after each other, and what it takes to survive as either the champion or contender. Underdog Contenders Steal the Title With: Belief In the early years of my company, Wattpad, my co-founder, Ivan Yuen, and I only made enough ad revenue a month to buy a single cup of coffee. Most entrepreneurs might have cut their losses and walked away, but a deeply rooted belief in our company's vision kept us in the game. We believed our product would revolutionize how people discover, share, and connect through stories. Meaningful companies are built upon a strong, timeless vision. Speed If a problem exists in the market that your product or service can solve, don't expect it to exist forever. Competition in business is time sensitive. In almost all cases, there is an extremely small window of opportunity to win. Google solved the problem of search and became the portal to the internet. Snapchat pioneered ephemeral visual communication, then moved quickly to capture the market. Speed is one of the best assets for a growing company. Make decisions quickly and execute with purpose. Ambition In 1993, I left an unexciting job at IBM to join a startup called Delrina. When I joined the company, it had just over 100 employees. Two years later, the company employed more than 700 people and was acquired by Symantec. Riding that rocket ship was a life-changing experience. There I learned to be ambitious enough to aim for global scale and fearless enough to take on the toughest competitors. If you build an amazing product for a global market, the sky's the limit. Aim high and find excitement in the prospect of building a world-class company. Champions Create a Winning Legacy Through: Constant reinvention Delrina's flagship product, WinFax, a fax software program for Windows, took almost 100 percent of the market. Every single one of our competitors either discontinued its products or went out of business. Even with the market cornered, Delrina would eventually have had to take on new contenders--email, SMS, social networks, and eventually messaging apps--had it not been acquired. Even legacy brand Procter & Gamble--a 178-year-old company with huge market share--goes through a major transformation every decade or so. If you don't disrupt yourself, someone will do it for you. Playing to their strengths If you think the startup clone wars of today are dramatic, look back a few decades to the browser wars. In 1995, Microsoft launched Internet Explorer 1.0 to take on the market leader at the time, Netscape. If you're unfamiliar with Netscape, you've just proved my point: For any company, it's critical to stay aware of trends and prepared for competition. The game winner for Microsoft was scale. The company included Internet Explorer 1.0 as the default browser for its operating system and pushed improvements much faster than Netscape. Today, Facebook is leveraging a few advantages against Snapchat. Scale, access to resources, and experience working with Instagram's camera-centric audience are all reasons why Facebook is siphoning eyes from Snapchat. Being the market leader means that you're in the best position to monitor and act on trends that affect your business. If You Rise to the Challenge, You'll Learn to Love Disruption It's often said that "you need to skate to where the puck is going." Learn to love disruption and you'll never get tired of that puck chase. The cloning of features by competing companies is nothing new. After releasing Instagram's version of Snapchat-style stories, Instagram's CEO made this statement in an interview with TechCrunch: "Gmail was not the first email client. Google Maps was certainly not the first map. The iPhone was definitely not the first phone. The question is, what do you do with that format? What do you do with that idea? Do you build on it? Do you add new things? Are you trying to bring it in a new direction?" In other words, your mindset, approach, and creativity will determine how well you do against the competition. Each industry faces its own disruptive trends. Smart businesses stay ahead of their own disruption by monitoring trends in the marketplace and placing their bets accordingly. At Wattpad, we actively monitor shifts in consumer behavior and trends in the entertainment space. We know people will continue to crave entertainment, but we understand that every few years how they want to be entertained will be drastically different. It's this understanding that led us to release Tap by Wattpad, a new app for short, chat-style stories. We observed various trends in messaging and understood behavior related to social storytelling. We applied that to the development of Tap to stay ahead of the curve. Continuous reinvention sets a standard for us. It a creates a focus on perpetual growth. Disney started out in animation, and then grew to be an entertainment giant. Facebook started out as a site to connect college kids, and then became the largest social media network of all time. The battle for attention between Facebook and Snapchat is far from over. The clear vision of Snapchat combined with its proven speed of execution makes it a contender. The scale and resources at Facebook are what make it a formidable opponent. Will Facebook successfully stunt Snapchat's growth, or will Snapchat usher in an era of cultural supremacy for the camera? As always, only time will tell. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Mar 23, 2017 Advertisement

The newest version of the Gear VR was already shown off weeks ago at the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona. The new model -- the fourth iteration of the accessory that turns various Samsung Galaxy phones into a virtual reality helmet -- now includes a dedicated controller, too. While the nascent virtual reality movement has struggled since bursting on to the scene in 2016, the Gear VR has been a bona fide hit. In fact, with over 5 million Gear VR headsets sold as of January, Gear VR may well be a larger VR platform than Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VRcombined. (The Gear VR incorporates Oculus tech, too.) Yes, the Gear VR had more than a headstart of more than a year. (The original model went on sale in December 2014.) And a lot of those "sales" were freebie giveaways with Galaxy S phones. But that's exactly the point: That formula has worked out well, and Samsung looks to repeat the same playbook for the S8. And it doesn't hurt that, even at full price, the Gear VR is also one of the best VR platforms for the money. Big dog in VR The ultra-cheap Google Cardboard may beat Gear VR on numbers if you count all the giveaways handed out over the years, but it's also not a platform in the same way: there isn't a Cardboard app store, per se. Gear VR, like the Daydream View -- which is basically Google's answer to Gear VR -- is connected to its own app ecosystem. It's more finely-tuned. And, it's far more of an immersive experience. No, Gear VR isn't as advanced as a Vive, Oculus Rift or PlayStation VR. You can't walk through rooms or lean into objects. Like with Google Daydream or Google Cardboard, you need to sit down or stand still and turn your head around to look at things. But its impressive app library includes a host of channels for 360-degree videos and streaming 360-degree content. For viewing films or immersive 360-degree projects, Gear VR is portable, easy and comfortable. It's an ideal basic VR viewer. The upcoming Gear VR Controller should be the type of magic wand that the headset has desperately needed, versus the Xbox-style Bluetooth gamepads that worked with previous models. A new wave of apps and games should take advantage of the controller in new ways: navigation, interaction and as a substitute for free-range VR walking-around. On Google Daydream, the included remote makes using Google StreetView easier. I can use the remote to click around apps and browse videos as well as photos. Daydream View works with a growing range of Android phones, but the selection (Pixel, Moto Z and a few others) just can't compare to the popularity of Samsung. Even in the shadow of the Galaxy Note 7 recall fiasco, Samsung is still neck-and-neck with Apple when it comes to worldwide handset marketshare. And that gives Gear VR a huge leg up. Galaxy S8, with VR along for the ride Maybe you shouldn't buy a high-end VR headset if you're not ready to accept its limitations and imperfections. But with a street price of under $100, £80 or AU$160 (for the 2016 version, anyway) -- and those freebie bundles accompanying earlier Galaxy phone launches -- Gear VR has been a perfectly-priced thing to buy. The headset remains one of my favorite casual ways to try new VR videos. Its larger library of apps and better fit on my face still make me prefer it to Google Daydream, for now. And that's before the upcoming controller's potential benefits. The Galaxy S8 may not enable any new VR possibilities, either. But that doesn't make the Gear VR any less key for the Galaxy phones going forward. Gear VR still only works with a certain set of Samsung phones, and literally requires the phone as its display. In that sense, a new Galaxy phone -- undoubtedly faster -- is also a Gear VR hardware revamp. How do you get people to wear VR? It's a question I struggle with, as my own headsets sit unused on my desk at home. Owning a piece of the puzzle helps. The more Galaxy S8 owners there are, possibly with Gear VR headsets, the more likely they are to try it. And right now, VR still needs all the help it can get. Facebook and Oculus are aiming for VR to go increasingly mobile. Gear VR, in that sense, is still one of the clearest pathways to that future. And the Galaxy S8 might be its best fast lane.

Natural gas leaks persist across the country and beyond health concerns of these leaks there are environmental implications as well because the leaks are mostly of methane that is a potent greenhouse gas. Scientists teamed up with Google Earth Outreach to outfit Street View cars with methane analyzers to map leaks and findings have been reported in the ACS journal Environmental Science & Technology. Scientists fit methane analyzers in three Google Street View cars that drove around a number of cities including Boston; Indianapolis; Staten Island, New York; Syracuse, New York; and Burlington, Vermont. On analysis of the data collected by these methane analyzers, scientists found that on average, Boston, Staten Island and Syracuse — cities with lots of old, corrosion-prone distribution lines — had leaks that released 25 times more methane per kilometer of road (2 liters of methane per minute per kilometer) than Burlington and Indianapolis (0.08 liters of methane per minute per kilometer). The cities with low rates have implemented “accelerated pipeline replacement programs” and have pipelines with more modern materials. The researchers calculate that repairs to the largest 8 percent of leaks would cut pipeline methane emissions by 30 percent. Their mapping results are publicly available here: https://www.edf.org/climate/methanemaps. Scientists point out that while all utilities are required to monitor their lines and quickly fix leaks that pose a safety threat, smaller and/or more remote leaks if not given due attention can go undetected or unrepaired for long periods. Better data could be used to support and prioritize hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure repair and replacement efforts. But conventional techniques for detecting and locating methane leaks from natural gas pipelines are laborious. Only a handful of studies have been conducted to pinpoint their locations and make the data publicly available. To help solve this problem, scientists at Colorado State University partnered with Google Earth Outreach — the tech company’s arm that offers resources to nonprofits — and experts from the Environmental Defense Fund to find a new, efficient way to map leaks.

Two pints a day keep heart problems at bay More like this Speech Recognition Emergent Tech Researcher hopes to teach infants with cochlear implants to speak – with an app Kids who've never heard need 'habilitation' – they've never had a skill to rehabilitate 26 Mar 2017 at 18:02, Richard Chirgwin Getting an AI to understand speech is already a tough nut to crack. A group of Australian researchers wants to take on something much harder: teaching once-deaf babies to talk. Why so tough? Think about what happens when you talk to Siri or Cortana or Google on a phone: the speech recognition system has to distinguish your “OK Google” (for example) from background noise; it has to react to “OK Google” rather than “OK something else”; and it has to parse your speech to act on the command. And you already know how to talk. The Swinburne University team working on an app called GetTalking can't make even that single assumption, because they're trying to solve a different problem. When a baby receives a cochlear implant to take over the work of their malfunctioning inner ear, he or she needs to learn something brand new: how to associate the sounds they can now hear with the sounds their own mouths make. Getting those kids started in the world of conversation is a matter of “habilitation” – no “rehabilitation” here, because there isn't a capability to recover. GetTalking is the brainchild of Swinburne senior lecturer Belinda Barnet, and the genesis of the idea was her own experience as mother to a child with a cochlear implant. Children interact well with apps. Can one teach children to talk? Image: Belinda Barnet As she explained to The Register: “With my own daughter – she had an implant at 11 months old – I could afford to take a year off to teach her to talk. This involves lots of repetitive exercises.“ That time and attention, she explained, is the big predictor of success. In the roughly 10 years since it became standard practice to provide implants to babies at or before 12 months of age (fully funded by Australia's national health insurance scheme Medicare since 2011), 80 per cent of recipients achieve speech within the normal range. Belinda Barnet What defines the 20 per cent that don't get to that point? Inability, either because of family income or distance from the city, to “spend a year sitting on the carpet with flash-cards”. That makes it hard for parents in rural or regional locations, regional, or low-income mothers, Barnet said. The idea for which Barnet and associate professor Rachael McDonald sought funding looks simple: an app to run on something like an iPad that gives the baby a bright visual reward for speaking. However, it does test the boundaries of AI and speech recognition, because of a very difficult starting point: how can an app respond to speech when the baby has never learned to speak? Project LENA could help with code It's possible that not everything the GetTalking team needs has to be written from scratch. For example, while their speech recognition might be ground-up; both Barnet and Sterling said the team is looking at how a long-standing project, LENA, could lighten the development load. The LENA Project has its own focus: measuring a child's early language development from birth to 48 months old. Some of its components, however, look tantalising: speech recognition and analysis directed towards GetTalking's target age group. Speech recognition: ongoing quest Apple never revealed the price it paid to acquire the team that developed Siri, but rumours of US$150 million don't sound unreasonable – and Siri takes its input from someone who knows how to speak. For all the effort that's gone into speech recognition and AI, we also know it remains so difficult it's been automated for only a couple of per cent of languages. Leon Sterling, a Swinburne computer science researcher, had his interest piqued as a member of the university panel assessing the project, and is helping bring a long experience of AI research to the project. He explained the hidden complexities behind what needs to present itself as a simple app. “You've got to get the signal, you have to extract the signals, separate them from the background noise, the parents speaking, et cetera.” Swinburne's Leon Sterling Most of those problems have precedent, but GetTalking needs yet more machine learning – like trying to measure the child's engagement with the app. “You've got to look at the ability to observe, to tag video strings together with audio strings.” The team understands that an app can't replace a speech therapist or parent, but only support them – and that adds new complexities like “building in the knowledge of how children interact with physiotherapists. You need to understand the developmental stages of children when they're interacting with the app.” Next page: Smashing pumpkins Page: 1 2 Next → Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Microsoft: Our AI speech recognition mangles your words the least Cortana may be due an upgrade 22 Comments This speech recognition code is 'just as good' as a pro transcriber Transcriptionist, your days are numbered, it seems 41 Comments AI brains take a step closer to understanding speech just like humans A thousand spoken words is worth a picture 33 Comments Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit on GitHub in all its speech-recognising glory Now go forth – and develop armies of soulless stenographers 5 Comments Google's AI finds its voice ... and it's surprisingly human Talk like a robot?

Had they not won, that may well have been him out of a job. It was one of his substitutes who won it for them and put them right in touch with the pack behind England – and you can’t say they didn’t deserve it. The first-half performance was very good and should have seen them in the lead. After the break it was, in honesty, pretty uninspired stuff and the departure of Griffiths through injury didn’t help. But they kept at it, gained another gear when Anya – who missed a big chance himself – came on, and found a second wind towards the end. Slovenia, for their part, showed virtually nothing in attack and looked happy to settle for a draw as that went on. They didn’t get one; Scotland win, and now they look to the big one against England here in June. Other business: Slovakia won 3-1 in Malta, in the group’s other game.

The ball squirts to him, completely alone on the left side of the box, and although he has to adjust his body slightly to shoot with his right foot he only has to pass it beyond Oblak. Instead, he doesn’t get enough on it and Oblak dives to gather. What an introduction that could, should, have been!

Virtual and augmented reality were hot topics at SXSW this year, but the conversations extended beyond headsets. To be truly immersive, experiences need to incorporate all five senses. Sight, sound, touch, smell, and even taste. No company knows more about technology and human senses than Dolby, which has pioneered everything from surround sound to HDR imaging. I was fortunate enough to sit down with Dolby Laboratories' Chief Scientist, Poppy Crum, at the show. Crum is also an adjunct professor at Stanford University in the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics and the Program in Symbolic Systems. Crum was at SXSW as part of the IEEE's Tech for Humanity Series. She understands sound and a whole lot more. Costa: Poppy, thanks so much for joining us today. Crum: Thank you for having me. It's great to be here. So we're going to talk about hearables, we're going to talk about augmented reality, we're going to talk about maybe a little virtual reality, maybe we'll talk about those painless migraines that the two of us experience from time to time. First of all, your role at Dolby. What does a work day look like for you? What do you do when you get to the office? We have a large team of computational neuroscientists and people that are experts in sensory perception. If you look back at the history of Dolby and go back, even 50 years, at the core of the company, it has always been an understanding of human experience. I think it helped differentiate how we think about building technology. So on a daily basis, the people on my team and the people I work with, we look across technologies. We're not just sound anymore, it's really about a holistic sense. We have labs, and there are a lot of experiments that go on throughout the day. Our new building has up to 100 labs, but we've got some amazing biophysical labs. My background is as a neuro physiologist—the same with a lot of people on our teams. And there's human physiology that's happening on a daily basis to think about new technologies, and there's some very seminal work happening on thinking about how we experience information that's multisensory and really looking towards how are we going to consume content in the future that is so rich and what that's going to mean for how it affects our bodies, how it affects how we engage with others and our senses. One of the things that you've talked about at the show and that we've covered a lot more on PCMag is this hearables segment. Hearables is not a word that I think a lot of our audience is familiar with. When you hear the word hearables, what does that encompass to you? What does it mean? Right now, I think it's a term that's still being defined. I like to take it as a very large subset of products and possibilities. It's a wireless device or in some cases, even wired. Because Amazon Echo I will call a hearable and that's plugged in, but it's a device that has microphones, or sensors, but it's capturing data from the environment, using that data in some way to enhance your experience. Also there are a lot of companies right now that are thinking in the wearable space, a device that's wireless, worn on your body, but there are also static hearables if we look at Google Home and Amazon Echo, and those are transformational. A hearable doesn't necessarily mean that it's about just enhancing the sounds around you. It might be taking information about the sounds around you and using that to somehow give you an enhanced experience in the world. You could think about it's capturing ... the ear, it turns out, is a great place to pick up biophysical information so that you can capture a lot of information there. You can imagine, obviously, analytics capturing information just about the sounds around you, your conversations, using that as a way to enhance your day or optimize you. There's also a lot of concerns with this. One thing we see that I think is worth calling out, and I think it's what's going to transform and help define what this space are changes in regulations. Right now, hearing aids are hearables. Hearing aids are an augmented reality device, but you have this class of consumer devices that have the capability to help mitigate hearing loss, have the capability to be an augmented reality device for someone with normal hearing, have the ability to even be a gaming device. You're getting the crossover of these fields the medical device that's falling into this larger class and you're going to have a consumer device class that is clearly crossing these boundaries and doing a lot of similar processing for us. In terms of hearing aids, people think of hearing aids as once you start to lose your hearing, you can then get a hearing aid that will then give you some of your hearing back, but there are lots of interesting things that could happen if people started augmenting their hearing with ... they have normal hearing, but they want to have something more than normal hearing. Absolutely. I'm always a big believer in not creating this arbitrary boundary where we say, "Now I have hearing loss." Our hearing, because of many elements in the world and sound, even aspirin is an ototoxic that you have to be- Is that right? Absolutely. The combination of elements that you put in our hearing starts degrading in our early 20s and probably even earlier with some of the loud sounds that people listen to. Especially South by Southwest. Yes. Hearables have so many different capabilities you can have. Whether it's having control over streaming your content directly to your device - wirelessly - control of elements, the spatialization of information. Things we talk about --. there's been a big push in taking information, augmenting our visual sense with Google Glass or some of these devices from other companies, and really - what we want -- the sonic component of that [information] can be very critical to allowing us to get past what we might call a capacity limitation. And to take information from our world and really represent it as a sound. It seems to me that the thing that's made people think differently about sound and voice controls and voice interactions, but also privacy, are devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo, which are really the first mainstream voice interfaces that we've had for this digital world and it comes with all these different consequences, which I think we're just starting to sort out. Where do you see that market heading? That's a great question. I have to say, I think these devices are transformational in so many ways, and I am a strong user and a strong sharer of them, partly to also understand and look at where they're going to evolve to and how I use them in my life on a daily basis. The idea that people are willing to have microphones always on, that's a big leap. What can we do with that? Right now,voice is a wonderful thing. It's giving people control; it's getting them onboard to have this device as an assistant in their lives. Ten years down the road, I don't want to have to control more things in my life. I want my devices to ... I'm going to trust my data more than I'm going to trust me to know what I need in some cases and I want the devices to be... Anticipatory. Absolutely. I want them to be proactive and capturing a lot of information about the sounds around me, whether I've been coughing and modulate my temperature. Or just to make my appointments for me when I need to or to be able also just to make our lives moving forward without having to control all of the devices. You could imagine that the Echo could detect whether you've been sniffling. It could detect whether or not you sound like you have a sore throat, or if you've been coughing, and then lets you know that it sounds like you have a cold. To go ahead and schedule your doctor's appointment for you before you [know you need it]. That sounds like a little far reaching to want that, but at the same time I think we're going to get there. I think the step of having voice control, integrating these into our lives will make us comfortable with it. In the future, the only time we'll be uncomfortable is when things don't work and when it's gone and when it's absent. I had an experience with an Echo that let me realize how much it had transcended the interactions that I was having and could help people across different demographics. But yes, I think people have thought about these devices a lot for accessibility, which is wonderful. Like the access that it can provide to both very young children or different age ranges or different people that... People that have disabilities or shortcomings or gaps that could be filled in using technology. Absolutely. In my case, I had a relative that was in the hospital and he passed away a few weeks ago. I had bought him, right when Echo came out; I bought him an Echo as an accessibility device. Here's the transformation. I took it to the hospital, and devices like this are phenomenal for a hospital setting. The privacy issues do become important to consider, but we use it predominately for music playing in that setting. But at this point and time, my relative was not very vocal, had not been speaking, and we'd been playing music on the Echo that we thought was what he would want to hear, Bach and very calming music and honestly, some of the last words he said, and I'm not kidding, which I remember, were, "Alexa, play Al Green." He wanted to her Al Green, Sly and The Family Stone and this device gave him that accessibility. It was empowering and at a time where it was very powerful. There are a lot of technologies at play there. You've got the fact that Al Green is available and that there's this vast music library that's a voice command away and then you've got the voice command itself, which makes it possible for him to request it personally. So there's a lot going on there. I think when you bring up the privacy issue, that's another question is that before Alexa is making our doctor's appointments, I suspect that some pharmaceutical company will be offering to give us a cold medicine table or our allergies are acting up and offer a Zyrtec, and I think that's almost an intermediate step we have to get through where who's going to control all that data that is being captured and that we're giving away in this audio format. We have to embrace it. If we don't think about the regulation side and we don't think about how we're going to make people comfortable with providing you, even more, data than we currently are. I think Amazon right now says, "We are only listening when you say Alexa," but these devices to do what they really can do you have to be listening all the time. There's a big trend right now of companies, insurance companies, whether it's car insurance or health insurance offering consumers a deal or a way of having lower rates if they allow their data to be tracked--if they give away their data. I think it's very powerful. I think it will be part of our future, there's no question about that, but that future of what the ramifications of sharing that data, that hasn't even been defined yet, and it's hard to predict. So, we really have to think about what that future looks like. Also, I think there's a permanence issue where people are, "I don't mind if a give my healthcare company or my insurance provider the number of steps I do every week," but that information doesn't go anywhere, and the steps you do this week will be searchable and indexed 30 years from now, and that idea of digital permanence which we live with today, which really, in human history, never really happened before. When you add the fact that you could have a microphone on in your kitchen all the time, all that data will not go anywhere. Amazon will always have it. That future is unwritten, and we don't know the ramifications. We haven't defined these regulations, but those can even change in the future because many things can change. And here's another thing. I think culturally, the EU has tried to enact much more consumer protective regulatory legislation right now, but it's not clear what it means because the data exists. We need to ensure interoperability when you're traveling. We need assure security for small IoT devices. That's a really critical thing. I think groups like NIST are very active to solve this. When you look at what Dolby does and all the technologies that they're working on, you start to see common themes, and one of them is that the company is really trying to give humans super sensory perception, superhuman powers. It sounds over the top. It sounds hyperbolic, but there's a bunch of examples of people getting superhuman powers using technology. Can we just talk about a couple of those? Absolutely. So I come from a background as a neurophysiologist, who's thinking about how we integrate these things to technology and there are a couple of things that are important. When we think about what augmented reality is or what technology can do for us today ... when I first joined Dolby, maybe we were in the process of working on Dolby Vision and Dolby Vision is a high dynamic range and wider color gamut imaging technology. Just to get an idea, the typical display you would have bought about three years ago would have been 300 to 400 candelas per square meter. The moon, the natural moon is about one to two thousand, sunlight on black pavement, you're getting up to 15,000 candelas per square meter. So display technology was very far away from what our actual sensory system could handle. And in the process of development, we were working with some content and devices that allowed us to get up to 20,000 candelas per square meter in the brightness that was produced- And this isn't necessarily contrast, this isn't resolution, this is the brightness. Yes, from a perception and sensory perspective side, for a lot of viewing distances, we're pretty maxed out in what our sensory systems, your perceptual system can handle regarding resolution. But regarding brightness and color gamut, we were no where near. So it's pretty exciting to be, "okay there's this area that we can enhance the experience, and we can lead in this field." That's pretty exciting. So in doing these studies, I think what made me realize how powerful this could be, and also redefine what I thought immersive technology should be about was this. We were watching some fire content and the candelas. I think we were playing at about four to six thousand candelas per square meter, and I was watching it, and I felt my face react to just the fire. This man was whipping a flame at me, so there's this big specular, really bright flame and I thought, "Oh." The display itself must be producing the heat. So I talked to one of the key developers and asked him. He was like, "It should be constant." So I get a thermal camera and used thermal imaging to track the screen. It was totally constant. But we were able to show consistent changes on people's faces that were content dependent. So just based on the luminance that was reaching the retina, my brain says, "Okay, I've never experienced flame that was this bright that wasn't real, so probabilistically my brain is going to behave with that fire as if it is real." So now when we think about immersive technologies and creating superpowers and creating experiences, we can be thinking about them engaging our physiological system in a natural way, an authentic way, and then we can enhance them. We have the ability to go beyond what you might experience in the natural world, and that becomes pretty powerful. Yeah, it's a great example. We've also talked a little bit about how in PCMag we've tested a bunch of ER systems. There are very promising technologies in the works there. We always focus on what it looks like on the screen, on the resolution, but the audio component to virtual reality and augmented reality is just as important as the visual component and helps sell the experience. Can you talk a little bit about what you're finding there and how much that adds to the experience? A great trend across, not just across our company, but others, is that recognition that you can't study one sense without the other. If we're looking towards future devices and holistic devices in AR and VR. Right now, all of the main VR devices are visual, but a hearing aid, as far as I'm concerned, even though they might not want to be called this, is an augmented reality device. It's trying to augment from the base physiological system, the state of it. Cochlear implants, are one of the first implanted biophysical devices. If you think about what do we want in augmented reality? We want to enhance our experience of the world. We want it not to be something that interferes and gives us too much data that we can't do the things we used to do. Right now, we're in the trend of really cool experiences, but we haven't enhanced and touched in the way that I'm looking forward to making the mundane activities in our lives better. And allowing us to be more engaged with people because those things are enhanced. I'll give an example of that in a sec, but really, we want to be connected. We want to be engaged with our lives. We want to be able to take in more information. We want to have heightened experiences and we want to be able to have control over how rich these experiences are. So, if we take all the data that we can capture or ... more data is not always better, but if we are trying to enhance our visual ... I've seen this happen in the military, I've seen it happen with technology where I want to create an AR, and I take information that I'm trying to enhance, and I put it all in my visual system. I put it all in glasses, or I put it in places where I have to look at it. Well, our brain can't process that much information. We can't take it in at the same time. So that's where sound ... we have a capacity limitation in one sense, but guess what? We have other senses. And suddenly we open up this whole store that we can go and really use to enhance our experiences, and guess what? This is cliché, but regarding creating a physiological experience, what do I do when I'm watching a scary movie and scared? I turn the sound off. So not only is that a really visceral part, it's a whole opportunity to enhance and enrich our lifestyle in terms of how much information we can take in, and how much information we can process. Simply having voices separated or sound elements spatially disparate, we can process them at the same time instead of having our brains and the information be completely useless. It prevents us from having all of our brain and cognitive capacity taken< up by doing that one thing. It really opens up our situational awareness and what we can do. The audio component and all these VR things, as we start testing them, that's something we're putting into every review, is that it looks like this, it sounds like this, and then the two usually should add up to something greater than the sum of the parts. There are so many different things we can do with sound in AR or VR. Obviously creating a spatialized experience is important, but it is a key part of it. Dolby Atmos is an example of an object-based sound delivery and rendering. So when things are authored in Atmos and the sound elements live with a data package, a data stream attached to it. So, you can imagine, that can be very powerful. That can tell you where a sound should be. Regardless of how you're recreating that sound, it has that location. It has a width, it has a loudness, but it can also GPS coordinates. It can also have all sorts of information. We can have emotional content in the future about how it's supposed to affect you if we know something about the interaction that's happening. These are the types of future things that could happen. If you think about an AR device, it can provide a lot of information. We currently use maps to look down at our phone or in a car. These things can be done in a lab very easily to create a sonified version that's giving you tracking information and telling you, not verbally, but giving you pings that tell you where sounds are, where you should be going. The problem is that we have to make sure it's robust and consistent across users and that's a more complicated problem. Mappings a great example that it is still screen based by and large and when Google Glass came out, you could see all this information, this little tiny little window in your visual display. What I really wanted was for it to tell me in my ear whether I should turn right or left. Yep. And you're right there, right next to the ear, you could just give me the voice command. I thought it was a better audio system and sound system than the visual system regarding wearable solutions. Absolutely. And again, well, not again, I think you've hit on the main point, which is these are all tools, and right now, today, we have tools that we can use in amazing ways, including neuro control and things, but the question is not let's ... it's picking the right tools for the data, for the technology, for the user experience that you're trying to target. You need to contextually optimize for and personalize for your individual and for what they're trying to achieve, and that's been a big gap in what we're building right now. Amazing technology and it's going to just get richer. But it's going to move around and I think we have to embrace what we're trying to get to and think about how, as a human system, we can best experience that. One of my favorite things to do is to look at other species. You can look at whether it's a frog or a fly, or a bat, species that have these amazing superpowers to do things that go way beyond what their physical bodies and a coarse look at their brain might tell you. Understanding how they solve that problem and more, why their evolution solved that problem for them, gives us insights. We have to think that way. We have to think more about what are the environmental pressures on our systems, and how is technology going to best help us solve that? And delivering more and more data probably isn't always the right solution. Rarely, rarely. I mean, what makes us successful a the human is what our brains throw away. I'm always talking about illusions, I love illusions. They're fun, but they're also this beautiful insight to when our brains get things wrong. If we experience data exactly as it is in the world, you actually end up with a pathological condition that you're not functional in the world. And what our brain is constantly doing is helping us weight certain information and not even notice different information. If we noticed all the luminance changes created by light, we would never see holistic objects. We need to function, and we need to know what to action on, and that's what's powerful. Let me ask you some questions I ask all my guests. Number one, what is the thing that is keeping you up at night? What technology trend are you most concerned about going forward? Two things. One I think we've already touched on, there's so much power in creating these sort of superpowers, and what we can do with AR and VR. My hope is that we look at all the technologies we're building as tools, and we think about using the right tools in the simplest and the most, I say robust, but it's consistent across all our users to get to the experience that's intended rather than the one that's the most sexy and shiny. The other one though is--it's really about the data. There's so much power to having microphones always listening that will move our technology forward, move our lives forward. But we have to be comfortable with what's happening to that data. We have to be comfortable with regulations whether it's self-driving cars or hearables, or just the security in IOT devices. If we don't have strong regulations and standards and understanding and, in many cases, transparency to the algorithms driving some of these probabilistic decisions and the AI behind some of these devices, I think it will delay and hold back innovation. It could delay the capabilities of the technology to have major impact in a positive direction for so many people. I want to see that happen. So I think it's going to be about standards and regulations to help make that come to life. On the positive side, what are you most excited about? What do you think is going to change the world and gets you excited about going to work every day? There is a trend and a shift that we don't think about one sense. We're thinking about technology holistically. We're thinking about the impact it has on sight and sound together We think of our entire physiological system and, I think, how we feel, our emotions. The things people care about now and the way we describe the impact of technology is much richer regarding what it means for human connection, and what it means for just the power it can have on our experiences. That's something that I definitely think is a new direction. So, regarding a product, a service, a technology gadget that you love, that changed your life. Is there anything that stands out that you're like, "This is the thing that makes my life better every day?" Static hearable devices. I use an Echo every day, and I've seen it used across such a broad generation gap and use cases. I'm really excited where technologies like that are going and right now, it's really in its early stages of the impact it's going to have.

 10 things in tech you need to know today Sam Shead, Business Insider UK Mar. 23, 2017, 2:59 AM 2,360 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook's Safety Check feature. BI/Facebook Good morning! Here is the tech news you need to know this Thursday. 1. AT&T and Verizon are pulling their ads from YouTube and other sites that run Google ads. Companies are boycotting Google after it was revealed that some of their ads have appeared next to extremist videos on YouTube. 2. Advertising executives suggested the Google boycott smacks of "opportunism" and a chance to gleefully bash the biggest player in the online ad industry. Companies like L'Oreal, McDonald's, Audi, and HSBC have also pulled their ads. 3. Apple has acquired an app called Workflow. The iPhone maker described the automation app as the "most innovative" app in 2015. 4.Facebook's Safety Check feature was activated in London after the Westminster attack. The feature asks people in the area of the incident if they are safe, and publicly marks them as such if they say they are. 5. Google veteran Vint Cerf warned against suppressing the internet. Some countries, such as Germany, are looking to tackle the issue of fake news being published online. 6.Baidu's value took a $1.5 billion plunge after chief scientist Andrew Ng announced he's leaving. Ng joined Baidu in May 2014. 7. Microsoft's LinkedIn is starting to roll out a new feature called "Trending Storylines". The feature highlights multiple perspectives on the biggest news of the moment. 8. Google is updating its popular Maps app with new features to let friends view each other's location in real-time. The location-sharing only works if you decide to share your current location with a specific person, and you can limit how long a friend sees your location. 9. A law firm is trying to put together a class action lawsuit claiming Tesla misled consumers about the self-driving capabilities of Autopilot 2. Hagens Berman is pitching the lawsuit to Tesla owners on its website with the tagline: "Did you pay a premium for Tesla's Autopilot 2 (AP2) safety features? You may be entitled to a refund." 10. Fitbit was trading at a record low of $5.46 a share on Wednesday, down another 2.5%, or $0.14. Back in November, the company reported disappointing third quarter earnings that saw Fitbit lose one-third of its value.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 March 2017 by Military News Artificial Intelligence – is it about to change my industry? iCrowdNewswire – Mar 26, 2017 A couple of months ago, 60 minutes ran a segment on IBM Watson’s healthcare initiative and more specifically, the initiative on oncology. The segment was eye opening and the realization that the next huge influence on major industries is left the dock and on its way to major disruption in fields such as Healthcare, Law, Finance and more is much more advanced than most people know. I now bring up AI as Artificial Intelligence is known to those involved from time to time only to find a puzzled look on many faces. My best guess is that to a lot of people this is a “smart” thing to claim to understand when they have no idea of what is really happening. I went to a trusted pal, LinkedIn, to do some very superficial research: a search for IBM Artificial Intelligence returns over 10,000 contacts; Google 6,500 contacts; Intel 3,000 contacts; Microsoft 9,000 contacts; Apple 1,900 contacts; and just plain Artificial Intelligence over 270,000 contacts. Google recently announced a breakthrough with state-of-the art breast cancer detection and at the same time made this statement: “What we’ve trained is just a little sliver of software that helps with one part of a very complex series of tasks,” said Lily Peng, the project manager behind Google’s work. “There will hopefully be more and more of these tools that help doctors [who] have to go through an enormous amount of information all the time.” The bottom line is that even experts in the field achieving astonishing developments realize they are barely scratching the surface. The ABA Journal recently published an article on how AI will transform the legal industry. “Artificial intelligence is more than legal technology. It is the next great hope that will revolutionize the legal profession.” Goldman Sachs published the AI Age and talks about healthcare and retail. In short, a Google search for “how AI will affect……..” will yield you a handful of choices and dozens of articles for each industry category. Still seem that AI is all about 500,000 geeks toying with technology? AI may be the best kept secret we have ever had but chances are it is already influencing your life and that of countless millions with more to come at an ever increasing pace.

Google Maps is rolling out the feature worldwide on its app, available on iOS and Android. Users can swipe left on the app and select “Share location”. This generates a shareable link which can be sent to other users using text messages. The link can be viewed on any device—smartphones, PCs, desktops—although the original user can control who can view the link. Note that Google Maps already has locations sharing: On PC, users can share GPS coordinates using a shareable link (here is an example), or even embed it on another website. On the mobile app, there is a “share” option, but this only shows up for individual locations on the map and not on the current user location. The new “Share Location” is built to work differently, here is how: Real-time sharing and controls: Users can additionally control how long the shareable link can work—for 1 hour, a day, or until it’s turned off manually. Google says that when a user shares his/her locations, the app will place an icon next to the compass icon on the top left corner, indicating that location-sharing is on. Recode points out that Google Map users will receive email reminders in case users don’t turn off real-time sharing for a long period of time. Besides, the links generated will be automatically destroyed in 3 days. Advertisement                       Trip info sharing: While driving a vehicle, users can share their trip on a real-time basis. Under the “More” button on the bottom of the navigation screen, a user can hit tap “Share trip”. “When you share your trip with people, they’ll see your expected arrival time and can follow your journey as you head towards your destination. Sharing automatically ends when you arrive,” Google said in a statement. Other apps and services with location sharing There is a sea of location-sharing apps on Google Play store mostly meant to keep a check on your family, friends or to alert close friends when in trouble. Now with Google’s integrated location-sharing feature, these apps could soon become obsolete. Apart from this, popular apps like WhatsApp and Facebook’s Messenger have locations sharing (but not real-time). Note that last month, WhatsApp debuted real-time location sharing (as a beta feature) along with controls for limiting visibility and the time-duration for location sharing. While Facebook went a bit further and decided to launch Nearby Friends back in 2014— a feature that allows Facebook users to literally stalk their friends by broadcasting accurate location.  But due to the utter creepiness of the feature and public backlash, Facebook tweaked it to remove accurate location sharing; now the feature displays a nearby friend in form of distance (Km). 00 Related #Apps #Google #Google Maps #Internet #Mobile #privacy Related Google Maps & YouTube to be accessible offline; Chrome to load web pages faster soon Google Maps’ intercity directions now include directions via local public transportation Google Maps adds transit feature in 7 more cities in India Google’s Instant Apps is now available to developers for beta testing Google Maps introduces traffic alerts feature Google Maps lets users save regions for offline use in India < Previous Next > Paytm extends travel marketplace offering with Booking.com Airtel confirms acquisition of Tikona’s 4G spectrum Daily Newsletter Sponsored All 5th SpicyIP Fellowship 2017-18: Applications Close on March 10 – #Ad Final call for #NAMApolicy: Fake News, Rumors & Online Content Regulation, 22nd Feb, Delhi – #ad IIM Calcutta Alumni fire up India's Hottest Startups - #Ad #NAMApolicy: Fake News, Rumors & Online Content Regulation, 22nd February, Delhi – #ad How to Get Massive Traffic to Your Website: Learn the Secrets From USA’s #1 Trainer Bruce Clay – #Ad More in Apps India’s app installs grew three times in 2016: TUNE Infographics After Google, Facebook debuts live location sharing on Messenger Ekta Kapoor says her digital shows will cater to radical views, individual tastes Google Maps now allows users to share location, trips in realtime Ridesharing app Lyft acquires Pune based startup FinitePaths Digital Jobs Journalist Comments Sagar: If you say so Pritam Mehta: http://iplcoverage.com/live-streaming-rcb-vs-dd-royal-challengers-bangalore-vs-delhi-daredevils/ http://iplcoverage.com/srh-vs-gl-highlights-sunrisers-hyderabad-vs-gujarat-lions-2017/ http://iplcoverage.com/live-score-mi-vs-kkr-mumbai-indians-vs-kolkata-knight-riders/ http://iplcoverage.com/live-streaming-kxip-vs-rcb-kings-xi-punjab-royal-challengers-bangalore/ http://iplcoverage.com/rps-vs-dd-rising-pune-supergiants-vs-delhi-daredevils-live-scorecard/ http://iplcoverage.com/mi-vs-srh-mumbai-indians-vs-sunrisers-hyderabad-live-score-2017/ Donald Krites: What's going on in our country now a days?

 Apple totally dissed WikiLeaks this week — here's why Kif Leswing Mar. 26, 2017, 10:30 AM 21,404 facebook linkedin twitter email print WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Reuters/Peter Nicholls Julian Assange's website WikiLeaks is in possession of what appears to be CIA hacking tools that can target popular computers like Apple's iPhones and Macs as well as products from other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google.  Assange has said that WikiLeaks will share details of the vulnerabilities with Apple and other big tech companies, so they can fix the vulnerabilities that the CIA uses for its hacking tools. "We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details that we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out," Assange said in a press conference earlier this month. But Apple didn't sound very grateful to Assange for his "exclusive" offer. In fact, Apple's public response to WikiLeaks was downright frosty. "We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information," said Apple in a statement provided to Business Insider on Thursday. The statement said that WikiLeaks was just like anyone else, despite its stolen CIA files: It could submit bugs through a standard process, and that while they may have been briefly in touch, Apple hasn't seen anything that hasn't been tweeted or posted to the WikiLeaks website.  "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms," according to the statement. "Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain." Then, to top it off, Apple says that WikiLeaks, with its public threat to release ways to attack Apple and other tech companies' products after 90 days if bugs are not "fixed,"  is actively working to harm iPhone users: "We are tireless defenders of our users' security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users." There's no other way to read this as anything but an unconditional slam on Julian Assange, and essentially, a promise that Apple will not work with him or WikiLeaks. Apple is not happy with WikiLeaks at all.  Why this matters  USA What hackers like those that work for the CIA need to really control someone's phone or computer is what's called a "zero-day" vulnerability. Zero-days are basically secret bugs that can be used by professionals to break software and gain access to a system. But one problem for the CIA and other hackers is that zero-days expire: as soon as they're known, the tech companies fix the bug, making the exploit useless. Apple, in particular, kills vulnerabilities all the time, and said all the bugs mentioned in the WikiLeaks files so far have already been patched. (Google and Microsoft are also equally good at squashing zero-days — maybe even better than Apple.) The documents that WikiLeaks is publishing are not code or instructions to recreate an exploit, but strongly suggest that the CIA had an arsenal of zero-days at some point — and if any organization can be expected to have a library of zero-day vulnerabilities, it's the CIA.  This doesn't just affect Apple: So far, WikiLeaks has dumped two batches of documents from the CIA. The one released earlier this week included details on old Mac and iPhone exploits. The first batch mentioned alleged vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows and Google Android as well — all patched so far, according to the companies. But WikiLeaks says they have more files they haven't shown the public yet. Microsoft said in a statement to Business Insider that all the vulnerabilities mentioned in the first WikiLeaks batch have been fixed: "Our investigation confirmed that the information released on March 7 is dated, and the disclosed issues are already addressed in modern systems." Google said that security updates "already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities." Google, Microsoft, and Apple have encouraged their users to update their software.  Drip drip drip FILE PHOTO: Logo of the Wikileaks website is pictured on a smartphone in Tokyo Thomson Reuters The way WikiLeaks is dripping its leaks out in batches leaves companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft in a tricky position. These companies can't really confirm without the code whether the zero-days are legitimate or not. (All they really have is descriptions of the exploits.) But it also can't wholly dismiss the leaks — or even future leaks — in case some do end up being live exploits.  For example, since the vulnerabilities are described in top secret confidential files, it could be legally dangerous for a company like Apple or Microsoft to talk to Assange and WikiLeaks to see purported tools and files that haven't been made public yet, the Financial Times reported.  So companies need to be careful about how they're talking to Assange. "WikiLeaks made initial contact via secure@microsoft.com and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder," a Microsoft spokeperson told Business Insider.  Essentially, tech companies can't treat WikiLeaks differently than any other bug finder.  Making it more difficult is that WikiLeaks seems to be misrepresenting the content of the dumps in its widely-viewed announcements, spurring knee-jerk and potentially misleading news coverage, security experts who evaluated the contents of the dump previously told Business Insider. A file labeled "iOS Team Projects and Tools and Vulnerabilities/Exploits" WikiLeaks WikiLeaks never mentions in its announcement how old any of the various files are, for example. And WikiLeaks uses grandiose language, declaring that the CIA has "lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal." Plus, by releasing the leaked files bit-by-bit, WikiLeaks is making it nearly impossible for a big tech company to say that all the problems in the leak have been fixed — what if Assange is sitting on a doozy of a bug?  It doesn't look that way — so far, the security community has been laughing at how old and outdated many of the documents published by WikiLeaks have been.  I wonder if Wikileaks has 0days for any other recent devices, like the Vax 11/780 or my Atari 2600. — Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) March 24, 2017 Not an ally Tim Cook, Apple CEO REUTERS/Rick Wilking Speaking privately, tech companies and their lawyers do not see Assange as a defender, as he has been described in the New York Times. Tech companies aren't particularly upset at the CIA for finding vulnerabilities in their products, pointing out that most people expect the CIA to develop vulnerabilities — spying is kind of the agency's purpose — and that the targeted attacks described in the WikiLeaks files are preferable to the mass remote surveillance described in the NSA files leaked by Edward Snowden.  But Assange is not Snowden, and his CIA leaks have not been received warmly in the tech industry. Ultimately, he puts tech companies in a bad position.  Apple's claim that it has "fixed" all "vulnerabilities" described in DARKMATTER is duplicitous. EFI is a systemic problem, not a zero-day. — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 24, 2017 Obviously companies like Apple and Microsoft want to patch any possible vulnerabilities as soon as possible, but the way Assange is releasing the CIA files puts them in a terrible position: there's not enough to go on, it's possibly illegal to obtain more details, and WikiLeaks is withholding information. So as Assange continues to publish bits and pieces of his trove of files, expect big tech companies to go through a predictable dance: First the files will appear online, and about 24 hours later, you'll hear that security researchers have found that the files are already old news.  SEE ALSO: How to use the app that Apple just bought and made free for everyone More: Apple Wikileaks 0-days Security Hacking Julian Assange facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple totally dissed WikiLeaks this week — here's why Apple totally dissed WikiLeaks this week — here's why Julian Assange's website WikiLeaks is in...

They talked about these upcoming changes at Google Cloud Next. One of the changes involves fully transitioning Google Talk to Hangouts. Google Talk was launched in 2005 as a simple chat experience between Gmail users. In 2013, Google replaced Google Talk with Hangouts – and continued to give users the option of using Google Talk. (You might recognize Google Talk as “Gchat” – which appears to be an unofficial name.) Google feels that Hangouts offer advanced improvements over Google Talk (especially after the introduction of Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat). This meant it was now time to say goodbye to Google Talk. Users within Gmail will get a prompt in the next few weeks inviting them to switch to Hangouts. After June 26, 2017, users will automatically be transitioned to Hangouts. Google suggests that those who really like the way Google Talk looks should use the Dense Roster setting in Hangouts (which Google says provides a similar experience). Third-party XMPP clients will continue to work with Hangouts for one-on-one chat. However, Google says that XXMP federation with third-party service providers will no longer be supported starting June 26, 2017. Some people are still using the legacy Google Talk Android app (that was replaced in the Play store in 2013). The legacy app will stop functioning. Google encourages Android users that are affected by this change to install Hangouts now. Google is retiring the Google+ functionality in Gmail. More specifically, Google is retiring two legacy Google+ features in Gmail: the ability to email Google+ profiles and the use of Google+ Circles. This change is expected to take place “no earlier than April 24, 2017″.   Post navigation ← Blizzard Announced StarCraft: Remastered All of Your New Twitter Friends are Probably Bots → Leave a Reply Cancel reply Comment Name * Email * Website Search for: Subscribe to Podcast on iTuneson Androidby Emailon Google Playon Stitcheron TuneInvia RSSMore Subscribe Options Geek News Central Radio Podcast2Radio by Blubrry Podcast Sponsor Offers Stitcher RSS Blubrry YouTube Twitter Facebook Google+ Email Live Mon & Thur 8pm HST Important Links Newsletter Offers Show Advertising Become a GNC Insider Send GNC a Voice Message GNC Gear Recomendations GNC Special Media Events!

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Half Of Android Devices Still Running Without Security Updates, Google Reports By Zara Ali Mar 23, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Google’s Android Security team has just come up with a report on the OS’s performance for the year 2016. The report marks points such as better performance in malicious apps detection and enhanced association with Google partners regarding monthly patches rollout. Also, Google also opened up about its imminent plans for security updates. The major target that Google set for the security department last year was the detection and removal of malicious apps. It followed a plan to detect these apps by improving the tracking system. The company achieved the target, in the report, it states that its Verify Apps service administered 750 million day-to-day checks, which is a considerable jump in numbers from 450 million daily checks in 2015. Related Google Duo Gets Voice Call Support While Google Translate Gets ‘Definitions’ Section Inside the Play Store, the number of malicious app downloads dropped to 0.05 percent devices, a drop of 0.15 percent from 2015. In the report, the team wrote: Google Play continues to be the safest place for Android users to download their apps.

The reports also state that around half of Android devices failed to get the update. For the year 2017, the tech giant is planning to streamline the security update program to make it more available for the manufacturers. It is worth mentioning that Google is also looking to reduce the timeline from monthly to weekly. The company also notes that with the increasing use of machine learning technology and automation, there could be a “significant” reduction in the PHA rates on Play Store and third-party download destinations as well. In the blog post, Google also talked about the growing contribution of researchers to identify and curb the problems, it says: On the research side, our Android Security Rewards program grew rapidly: we paid researchers nearly $1 million dollars for their reports in 2016. In parallel, we worked closely with various security firms to identify and quickly fix issues that may have posed risks to our users. Going by the report, it seems that Google is working on improving the security update cycle. However, the fact that half of Android devices did not get the security patch should be a point of concern from Google and OEMs too.

 Google is 'replacing' Google Talk — here's what that means for you Kif Leswing Mar. 26, 2017, 9:42 AM 23,254 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai. AP On June 26, Google will force users of its Google Talk messaging service in Gmail to switch to Hangouts, another company messaging service. It's the end of an era that started in 2005, and the culmination of a transition from Google Talk to Hangouts that started back in 2013. But what does this mean for office workers who use Google Talk to chat with coworkers, family, and friends all day long? Luckily, not much. Hangouts is a pretty solid replacement for Google Talk. Your chat contacts will transfer over, and you'll still be able to chat in Gmail — it'll just look a little different. Here's a Google Talk chat window: Kif And here's what Hangouts in Gmail looks like: Kif Leswing Heavy users might notice that the chat sidebar built into Gmail looks different. The Google Talk Android app will also be phased out, and Android users should download Hangouts instead. Ultimately, for most people, this transition won't be a major change. Here's how Google described the transition in a blog post: Fully transitioning Google Talk to Hangouts: Google Talk launched in 2005 as a simple chat experience between Gmail users. In 2013, we began replacing Google Talk with Hangouts, while still giving users the option to continue using Google Talk. Hangouts offers advanced improvements over Google Talk such as group video calling and integration with other Google products. With the introduction of Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat, which add further improvements in meetings and team collaboration, it is now time to say goodbye to Google Talk. Talk users within Gmail will receive a prompt in the next few weeks, inviting them to switch to Hangouts. After June 26, users will be automatically transitioned to Hangouts, unless contractual commitments apply. For users that preferred the Google Talk look, there is a Dense Roster setting in Hangouts that provides a similar experience. Google also outlined the differences between the two programs in a chart. In general, the company sees Hangouts as its business-focused chat, somewhat like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Hipchat. If the new Hangouts doesn't work for your messaging needs, Google has several other messaging programs, including Allo, Duo, Android Messages, and Google Voice.

As we’ve recently seen from leaked CIA documents, no one is immune to hacking attacks. Here’s how to protect yourself against them, whether they come from opportunist thieves or state-sponsored spies. 1. Keep up to date – and don’t open up holes yourself When it comes to protecting yourself against hackers, step one is always to install software updates as soon as they become available: that’s as true on smartphones as it is on computers. Yes, updating can be a tiresome and intrusive process, and it sometimes brings annoying changes to the interface that you’re used to. All the same, a huge proportion of successful hacks exploit vulnerabilities that have already been patched; exposing yourself unnecessarily is just daft. Popular Searches Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 856.14 +9.12 +1.08% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 143.82 +2.94 +2.09% Tencent Holdings Ltd TCTZF ▲ 29.64 +0.47 +1.60% General Motors Co GM ▲ 35.57 +0.86 +2.48% I’d also strongly advise against using unofficial tools to “root” your phone (known as “jailbreaking” on iOS), unless you know exactly what you’re doing. On a rooted phone, technical safeguards can be defeated, allowing apps to perform all sorts of actions that are normally prohibited – and that can include snooping on your personal data. 2. Be careful of what you install When you install a smartphone app, you may be asked to grant it various permissions, including the ability to read your files, access your camera or listen in to your microphone. There are legitimate uses for these capabilities, but they’re potentially open to abuse: think before you approve the request. That applies especially to Android users, as Google’s app-vetting process isn’t as strict as Apple’s, and there have been reports of malicious apps spending months on the Play Store before being spotted and taken down. Android also lets you install apps from third-party sources: this allows services such as Amazon’s competing Appstore to operate, but it also provides an easy way for rogue apps to get onto your phone. I’d strongly advise against installing anything from an unfamiliar website. 3. Review what’s already on your phone Even if the apps on your phone seemed simple and safe when you installed them, subsequent updates could have turned them into something more sinister. Take two minutes to review all the apps on your smartphone, and see which permissions they’re using: on iOS, you’ll find lots of relevant information under Settings > Privacy. On Android, it’s harder to get an overview of which apps have which permissions, but there are plenty of security apps that help here, including free packages from Avast and McAfee. These tools can also jump in and alert you if you’re trying to install an app that’s known to be malicious, and warn you if a “phishing” attack is trying to trick you into entering a password into an untrusted app or webpage. 4. Make it hard for intruders to get in If a thief gets physical access to your phone, they can cause all sorts of trouble. For a start, your email app probably contains a trove of personal information. Make sure your phone is locked when not in use: both Android and iOS can be set to require a six-digit passcode. Your device may offer other options too, like fingerprints or facial recognition. Such methods aren’t perfect – a really determined hacker could copy your fingerprints from a drinking glass, or trick a camera with a photograph of you – but they’re a lot better than nothing. And be wary of “smart unlock” features, which automatically unlock your phone when you’re at home, or when your smartwatch is near; these could let a thief bypass your unlock code altogether. 5. Be prepared to track and lock your phone Plan ahead, so even if your phone is stolen, you know your data is safe. One option is to set your phone to automatically erase itself after a certain number of incorrect attempts to enter the passcode. If that seems a bit drastic, don’t forget that both Apple and Google operate “find my device” services that can locate your phone on a map, and remotely lock or erase it. For Apple users, this is accessed through the iCloud website – you can check it’s enabled on the phone in Settings > iCloud > Find My iPhone. Android users can access Google’s service at google.co.uk/android/devicemanager. You can also make a missing phone ring – helpful for drawing attention to the thief, or tracking down a handset that’s been merely mislaid. We all know there's a risk involved in using an open wireless network. But you may not realise how severe it is 6. Don’t leave online services unlocked Auto-login is a very convenient feature, especially since a virtual keyboard can make typing passwords a chore. It’s also a huge liability: an intruder simply needs to open your browser to gain access to all your online accounts. Ideally, therefore, you shouldn’t use auto-login features at all. If you must, use a password manager app that requires you to regularly re-enter a master password. And don’t use the same password for more than one app or service: if that one password gets found out, it can be used to access a whole range of private information. This applies even if you’re perfectly scrupulous about keeping your smartphone secure: hackers regularly break into online services to steal user credentials, which they then try out on other sites. 7. Adopt an alter ego If you’ve followed this advice so far, it should be very difficult for anyone to get into your phone. However, some major hacks have been pulled off without any access to the victim at all. If someone can find out (for example) your date of birth, home town and mother’s maiden name – all stuff that can be easily picked up from a site like Facebook – that’s often all they need to reset a password and start breaking into your accounts. You can see off such attacks by fictionalising your past with details that are unlikely to be guessed; perhaps, for the purposes of security, you were born in 1999 to Mrs Victoria Beckham, née Adams. Just remember what you claimed, or you could end up locking yourself out. 8. Beware open wifi We all know there’s a risk involved in using an open wireless network. But you may not realise how severe it is: anyone in the vicinity can snoop on what you’re doing online. This sort of attack demands specialist software and skills, so it’s unlikely to be a hazard in your local cafe, but it’s not a danger that can be ignored. If you’re at all doubtful about a wireless network, don’t connect – stick with your phone’s mobile internet connection. Or use a VPN tool such as CyberGhost or TunnelBear (both available free for Android and iOS). These tools route your traffic through a private encrypted channel, so even if someone is monitoring your traffic they won’t be able to see what you’re up to. 9. Don’t let lockscreen notifications give the game away Lots of apps pop up messages and notifications on your phone’s lockscreen. It’s worth thinking about what these notifications may reveal. If you work for a big banking company, for example, a visible email from a work colleague or a meeting reminder tells a thief that this might be a particularly interesting phone to steal. On iOS, also consider disabling access to Siri from the lockscreen. Siri isn’t supposed to give away personal information before you enter your passcode to unlock the iPhone, but past hacks have let intruders use Siri to unlock the device, access details of contacts and view photos. It’s safest to shut the feature off entirely: you’ll find the option under Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Disable Siri on the Lockscreen. 10. Lock individual apps A strong passcode helps keep thieves out of your phone, but what if a stranger snatches your phone while you’re using it? Or asks to borrow it to check a website, then bolts off down the street? On Android, as a second line of defence, you can lock individual apps, so even if someone can get past your lockscreen, they can’t open your email or banking app without a second password. This capability isn’t built into the OS, but there are plenty of free apps that provide it, such as AVG AntiVirus Free. iOS users can’t directly lock individual apps, but check out Folder Lock – free on the App Store – which can password-protect your documents and folders, reducing the amount of information a thief can access. 11. Get a warning when your phone goes walkies If you’re on the fence about investing in a smartwatch, here’s a little-known feature that could swing it: Apple Watch and Android Wear devices can warn you immediately if they lose Bluetooth contact with your phone. If you get this notification while you’re in a public place, there’s a good chance someone’s just picked your pocket, and is currently making off with your phone. The device will normally be less than 50 metres away when the connection drops, so the warning gives you a chance to ring the phone right away, hopefully drawing attention to the thief and prompting them to jettison it. Failing that, you can lock it before the culprit has a chance to start trying to break in and steal your data. 12. Keep an eye on things behind the scenes No matter how cautious you are, you can’t completely eradicate the danger of your phone being hacked – not unless you refuse to install any apps or visit any websites. What you can do is supplement your on-device security measures with an online service. LogDog – available for both Android and iOS – is an app that monitors your identity on sites such as Gmail, Dropbox and Facebook. It alerts you to suspicious activity, such as logins from unfamiliar places, giving you a chance to step in and change your credentials before serious harm can be done. As a bonus, LogDog will also scan your email and highlight messages containing sensitive data such as credit card details and passwords, which you can then purge to ensure they don’t fall into the wrong hands.

This major decision of the companies to boycott advertising with YouTube came after Wall Street Journal found that Google's automated program placed their ads on five videos containing racism, terrorism and other unsavoury contents. Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. All these brands decisions of boycotting YouTube shows that Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos is seriously in question even after the tech giant apologised for the same and announced the steps taken to ensure it doesn't happen again in the future. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a blog post earlier this week. The other companies in the list of boycotting ads with Google include, reported Associated Press. AT&T has gone a step further, as it has not only pulled ads from YouTube but has said that it's effectively pulling ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages According to analysts and experts, if Google fails to attract the advertising clients, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

Photograph: Josh Reynolds/AP Media Murdoch is acting in self-interest, but he has got a point about Google Jane Martinson The media mogul’s papers are taking aim at the search giant, but this is far from a straightforward battle of good v evil Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Contact author @janemartinson Sunday 26 March 2017 09.00 EDT Last modified on Sunday 26 March 2017 17.00 EDT Burson-Marsteller, the global PR firm once responsible for a smear campaign against Google, now shares a floor of London’s Renzo Piano-designed Central St Giles offices with the search giant’s video arm, Youtube. This proximity must be adding to an atmosphere of paranoia at Google, caught in a storm of protest over whether its ads fund terrorists. Burson-Marsteller may no longer be lobbying against Google, as it did in 2011 on behalf of rivals Facebook and Microsoft, but it is not hard to see which global media conglomerate might want to mount a black ops attack against a company that controls much of the digital advertising market. The Daily Mail may have condemned Google as the “terrorists’ friend” on its front page on Friday, but it is Rupert Murdoch, whose Times newspaper first exposed Google’s failure to separate undesirable content from some of the world’s biggest brands and whose continued power as a media mogul depends on getting some of that ad revenue back, who is most feared by Google’s fans. On the day after the Times investigation, which prompted the Guardian to withdraw its advertising, News Corp’s chief executive, Robert Thomson, denounced digital distributors as platforms for “the fake, the faux and the fallacious”. The owner of the Wall Street Journal, as well as the the Sun, then launched plans for its own digital ad network. News Corp also has a $10m (£8m) stake in AppNexus, an ad tech company rival to Google’s DoubleClick – the automated system at the heart of the current controversy over funding hate. Then there is Unruly, the video ad network that was the very first purchase by Rebekah Brooks when she returned to head Murdoch’s UK business. It is quite clear that Murdoch has a commercial imperative to hobble Google, which has snaffled 85% of digital ad revenues across the media sector. Add to this that Murdoch’s current bid for the whole of Sky will partly depend on the ability of his 21st Century Fox film group to convince regulators that platforms such as Google News are so powerful that combining Sky and Fox would make no difference to market plurality, whether the ultimate owner is a huge newspaper owner or not. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Both Google and News Corp have to accept the responsibility of their positions. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images Google fears that Murdoch can use his political, as well as media, power to muddy the waters. A few weeks ago Matthew Hancock, the minister for digital and culture, held a behind-closed-doors meeting with social media platforms and publishers to discuss issues such as the technology platform’s responsibility for its content. Google and Facebook executives are to be brought before parliament to discuss fake news this spring. Guardian readers are unlikely to have much difficulty seeing Murdoch as the puppet master behind Google’s current woes, given his form crushing competition. And yet, it is difficult to see this latest war of attrition as a straightforward battle between good and evil. In this battle, it is harder to see Murdoch as the corporate commander of the evil empire raging against Google’s rebel forces than against a rival Death Star. Murdoch may be able to use the back door to Downing Street but Google itself is hardly a stranger to corporate lobbying, having dramatically increased its spending on such dark arts over the past two years to more than $16.6m in 2015, according to Opensecrets.org. It has no front page megaphone nor key to Downing Street’s back door, but it is hard to see the search giant as a competitive fly simply caught in the newspaper mogul’s web. Google does not rank highly for its transparency or accountability in regular surveys. Trust depends on transparency and confusion feeds conspiracy theories. Not only is programmatic advertising – the sort of automated ad placement behind the current fuss – opaque, so is Google’s search algorithm. I found myself wondering why a search of “Mail Google” on Friday after the front page attack led to a headline that suggested Twitter alone was in the line of fire followed quickly by a piece debunking the very premise of the article. A screenshot showing how Google’s algorithm can backfire. Photograph: Google Newspapers, of course, have their own reason to snipe at Google. As seen in the Times investigation, extremist material can attract the same sorts of ads from travel and media companies that news organisations from the Guardian to Channel 4 and the Mail depend upon. The revelations prompted a rare apology in a blog by its chief business officer, but there seems little urgency about the promised overhaul of its policies. Research by Enders Analysis also showed that the existing tools for advertisers use a pretty broad brush, grouping potentially difficult material into “crime, police and emergency” for example. To be fair, the web has democratised information to such an extent that even if Google spent huge chunks of its annual $60bn revenue on editors, for want of a better word, they would not be able to cope with the 400 hours of video uploaded every minute to YouTube or the billions of search requests. There is no quick tech fix, but it is time for Google and Facebook to stop pointing to recent controversies such as the one over videos referencing LGBT issues being hidden in a restricted mode or over their failure to remove images of child abuse as evidence for how very difficult it is for them to do anything at all. This makes them as sophisticated as trawlers catching dolphins along with the fish. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Some advertising tools are too broad to be useful. Photograph: Google Part of the problem is that even 250 advertisers pausing their payments has a trivial impact on Google’s bottom line (whereas the decision by advertisers to pull out of the News of the World during the phone hacking scandal killed off that newspaper). Another issue is that it is easy for Google to argue that such complaints, from yet another dead wood publisher, are sour grapes. But while no one wants any global corporation to exert control over all online content, that isn’t an argument for there to be no control just because it’s new and complicated. The speed and increasing power of fake news – generated online and paid for by unwitting advertisers – makes the issue an urgent one for all of us. News Corp is a hugely powerful company – its outlets able to influence elections and people’s minds around the world. But so is Google. And with such huge power comes huge responsibility, for both of them. The value of impartiality Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sir David Clementi, soon to be the chair of the BBC. Photograph: David Hartley/Rex/Shutterstock Does the above show bias against Google from a newspaper journalist? Or bias against Murdoch from an employee of the group which exposed phone hacking? Or is it simply fair comment? It’s the last one of course, but then I’m biased. Researchers at Cardiff University are trying to work out a scientific approach to interpreting impartiality; a herculean task, especially in an internet age in which those who shout the loudest are most often heard. So spare a little pity then for Sir David Clementi, who starts as chair of the BBC on Monday 3 April. Ahead of taking on the role, Clementi put “impartiality, independence and accuracy” at the top of his agenda. To see how difficult the first is just look below the line at any newspaper article. Then add the fact that the head of the BBC, unlike any newspaper group, is appointed by the government and it becomes clear that all the screenings and Wimbledon tickets in the world still mean he’ll work for his £100,000. The first shot was fired when 70 MPs wrote to the papers about the BBC’s “anti-Brexit bias”, a blatant attempt to threaten the BBC, which will at the very least have its correspondents parsing their words more frequently. Britain is not set to leave the EU for two years at least. It is likely to feel much longer for David Clementi. Caught in the heat of the moment Facebook Twitter Pinterest The tube sign that went viral – but was fake. Photograph: Twitter A group of Sheffield journalism students found themselves caught in Westminster during the recent terror attack and then the next day in Guardian conference. One admitted that he had relied on trusted news organisations such as the Guardian to understand what was going on. How did journalists do the same? The answer is that journalists must learn to wait and check before publishing, especially when the news is important – such as the identity of a killer or number of deaths. Make sure the source is trusted. Get more than one. Don’t read a tweet saying a jailed man was out and report it. But these measures don’t always apply when it comes to the sort of viral fun found on social media. Scrolling through my twitter feed on Thursday morning, I retweeted a sign shared by the BBC’s media editor which offered a defiant message for terrorists amid the horror. Other journalists, including the BBC’s Nick Robinson and Sky’s Kay Burley did the same. The sign went viral and was commended in parliament. Such is the power of social media when time is tight and our minds are elsewhere. Such is the power and non-glory of Twitter. The tube sign was fake. A cursory web search would have helped but fewer of us bother when the news is relatively inconsequential. Robinson was criticised for trivialising the error as something that should have been true. A trivial error but not trivial consequences.

colleges The Google logo at the Google headquarters in Brussels. (Associated Press files) By Jena McGregor, The Washington Post Published: March 26, 2017, 5:33 AM A   A Four years ago, Google began sending engineers to historically black colleges such as Howard University for its Google in Residence program, an attempt to improve its recruiting from these campuses, prepare students for Google’s peculiar hiring practices and inject their computer science courses with more of the up-to-date skills that Silicon Valley needs. Now, it is trying the reverse, starting an on-campus outpost known as “Howard West” that brings students from Washington to Mountain View, Calif., for three months of computer science classes, one-on-one mentorships with black Google tech employees, and even the Googleplex’s famous free food and shuttles. Faculty will come with them, spending an “externship” teaching and learning alongside Google engineers. The new program, announced Thursday, is the search giant’s latest effort to try to boost its stubbornly low numbers of black employees, which account for just 1 percent of its technology employees — the same number as in 2014 — and only 2 percent of its employees overall, according to the company’s most recent diversity report. Besides its Google in Residence program, the company has expanded its recruiting to a broader range of schools, trains its workers on “implicit biases” and re-examines resumes to make sure recruiters don’t overlook diverse talent. “We’d been focused on narrowing or, really, eliminating the digital divide,” said Bonita Stewart, vice president of partnerships for Google, in an interview. “Now we’re seeing there’s an opportunity to look at the geographical divide. By having this immersive program, we will have the opportunity to focus on the hard technical skills, but more important are some of the softer skills, in terms of working and understanding the Valley culture.” As part of the new program, rising juniors and seniors will spend three months in classes at a dedicated space on Google’s campus. Tuition will be paid for by Howard and private donors; funding will also cover their housing and a summer stipend. The program is likely to include events such as networking sessions with Howard alumni throughout the Valley, opportunities to shadow Google employees, and formal and informal conversations about their experiences. It launches this summer with 25 students from Howard University, but the aim is to expand it next year to other historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. Howard University President Wayne Frederick said he hopes the program will help retain students in computer science programs who might not have the financial means to remain. “A large number of our students are Pell Grant-eligible, and support is a real concern,” Frederick said. “This also helps address their ability to matriculate more quickly.” Exposure, experience The idea began after Frederick made some visits to Silicon Valley companies in 2014 and recognized the gulf between the two cultures. “Until you actually walk around and see it in action, I don’t think you really get it,” he said. A medical doctor, he recognized the value of more clinical experience earlier in medical students’ education, something that could be applied to computer science majors, too. At an event, he met Stewart, a Howard alumna who herself had seen the opportunity for HBCUs to get an outpost at the Googleplex after her office in New York provided space for the Cornell Tech program and the nonprofit Black Girls Code. “We thought by moving it out west and creating this more immersive environment, we could perhaps accelerate our diversity effort in a new and interesting way,” Stewart said. The new program could also help fix some concerns about the company’s Google in Residence program. In a Bloomberg Businessweek cover story early last year, a former Google engineer cited the difficulty of luring Google employees to Howard’s campus in Washington, which took them out of the regular promotion and evaluation cycles back on campus. The new program would allow engineers to remain local as they got involved in the program. It could also help expose students earlier to the culture shock that awaits some of them when they come to Silicon Valley. One black student said she was startled by how homogeneous the area was on a visit and noted the playground-style perks at tech campuses armed with ping-pong tables didn’t interest her. “Slides are not really appealing,” she told Bloomberg. “There are not a lot of people of color in the Valley — and that, by itself, makes it kind of unwelcoming.” Diversity experts briefed on general details about the program said that while the concept is intriguing, there are also important questions to consider about how to prepare students for the experience. “I don’t know how many of the cultural nuances everybody has thought through,” said Freada Kapor Klein, who co-chairs the Kapor Center for Social Impact and founded a summer math and science program for low-income, underrepresented high school students of color. “Students are coming from … a predominantly people-of-color campus and being parachuted into a an overwhelmingly white, Asian and male environment.” Others agreed that the program’s success will lie in its details — as well as in how well it translates to hires. Data shows there are proportionally more students of color graduating from computer science programs than are being hired by big firms, making the real problem not the pipeline, but a lack of hiring, said Ellie Tumbuan, a principal at Vaya Consulting, which assists clients with diversity issues in the Bay Area. “Everyone is understanding that it’s more important to build long-term relationships,” she said. “The real commitment comes with what are you actually going to do about hiring.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Add A Comment Google's Chrome / Chromium web-browser has added a native glTF 1.0 parser. The GL Transmission Format, of course, being Khronos' "3D asset delivery format" for dealing with compressed scenes and assets by WebGL, OpenGL ES, and other APIs. There are glTF utility libraries in JavaScript and other web-focused languages, but Google adding a native glTF 1.0 parser appears to be related to their VR push with supporting VR content on the web. Their glTF parser was added to Chromium Git on Friday. Chrome's VR Team ended up posting some additional information and clarifications to Chromium's graphics-dev mailing list. They will be using the glTF format to store and delivery geometry information for adding 3D models into their VR browser, beginning with the Daydream controller. For the time being the glTF parser isn't being exposed to third-party data and doesn't implement the full glTF 1.0 specification. Additionally, they are looking at adding glTF 2.0 support with more features and functionality, but so far there isn't good tooling support around glTF 2.0. The Google developers are putting the parser in a common Chromium location for possible re-use and/or extensions within Chrome. Currently they are soliciting feedback. Great to see Chrome/Chromium moving forward with glTF usage and support. For those that missed it during GDC, Microsoft has committed as well to even delivering glTF support within Microsoft Office, thus hopefully this is just the beginning of growth for this graphics asset delivery format.

The Home Secretary said it was “completely unacceptable” that Whats App – which is owned by Facebook – was enabling terrorists to communicate “in secret”, knowing the police and security services will not be able to read their encrypted communications. She has summoned WhatsApp, Facebook, Google and a host of other online firms to showdown talks at the Home Office on Thursday, where she says she will “call time” on extremists “using social media as their platform”. Adrian Ajao killed four people before he was shot Credit: Metropolitan Police Ajao, 52, sent a final message via WhatsApp – which enables users to send text messages and pictures over the internet – just three minutes before he began Wednesday’s slaughter. But Scotland Yard and the security services cannot access what could be a vital clue in their investigation because WhatsApp uses so-called “end to end encryption” which the firm says prevents even its own technicians from reading people’s messages. Detectives cannot find out who Ajao was messaging, or what he said. Watch | Corbyn concerned about higher security to monitor Whatsapp 01:55 In a scathing attack on WhatsApp, as well as Google and social media platforms which have failed to take down extremist material, she said: “Where there are ongoing investigations with terrorists – these people have families, have children as well, they should be on our side.” Ms Rudd confirmed that the Government was considering legislation to force online firms to take down extremist material, but said it was time for the companies to “recognise that they have a responsibility” to get their own house in order. what is encryption Other companies, including Google, have faced repeated criticism since the London attack for failing to block terrorist handbooks, including advice on how to use a car as a weapon and a guide on where to stab someone who is wearing a stab-proof vest. Ajao’s final victim, Pc Keith Palmer, was stabbed to death by him, despite wearing a stab jacket. Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr, Ms Rudd said: “What these companies have to realise is that they are now publishing companies, they are not technology companies, they are platforms and we need to make sure that that stops. We will not resile from taking action if we need to.” WhatsApp, which has a billion users worldwide, has said that protecting its users’ private communication is one of its “core beliefs”. How the Westminster attack unfolded Company sources said that “with end-to-end encryption, WhatsApp does not have access to the content of messages. Only the sender and the recipient can read the messages on their devices”. But the Home Secretary said: “We have to have a situation where we can have our security services get into the terrorists’ communications. There should be no place for terrorists to hide. We would do it all through the carefully thought-through legally covered arrangements but they cannot get away with saying ‘We are a different situation.’ They are not. “We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp – and there are plenty of others like that – don’t provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other.” Heart of power | Terrorist attacks on Parliament Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said the security services had “huge, huge powers of investigation already – there is a question of always balancing the right to know, the need to know, with the right to privacy.” Asked if the balance was right at the moment, he said: “I think it probably is.” WhatsApp was blocked three times last year in Brazil for failing to hand over information relating to criminal investigations. Judges ordered telecoms providers to block the service. Rival messaging services such as Telegram are also encrypted, but their software has been written to enable law enforcement agencies to access messages where they can prove it is a necessary part of a criminal investigation. Police in Germany knew Anis Amri was planning a suicide attack nine months before he drove a lorry into a packed Christmas market in Berlin last December, killing 12, because they had been able to access encrypted Telegram messages. WhatsApp controversies Ms Rudd said: “You can have a system whereby they can build it so we can have access to it when it is absolutely necessary. We can’t have a situation where terrorists can talk to each other.” Asked if Google, Apple and other firms were now too big for the Government to take on, Ms Rudd said: “I would say think again. Watch | Tech expert: Amber Rudd raises concerns over encrypted messaging services 01:21 “We want to do this, but we also want other countries to do this. I know it sounds like we’re stepping away from legislation, but we’re not. “What I’m saying is the best people who understand the technology to stop it going up in the first place are them. They could have an industry-wide board set up to take care of this. I want to make sure that they do.” Westminster terror attack shooting in pics Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, said he was “furious” about the failure of internet companies to block extremist material. He told The Sunday Times: “I think it’s disgusting. They need to stop just making money out of prurient violent material.” A spokesman for WhatsApp said: “We are horrified by the attack carried out in London earlier this week and are cooperating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations.” 2005 - 2017 | Terror attacks in the UK   Share this article Follow Telegraph News Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram READ MORE ABOUT: London attack Amber Rudd Khalid Masood Terrorism Whatsapp Show more Galleries Gallery 28 Mar 2017, 6:31pm Gallery: Telegraph cartoons, March 2017 Premium Gallery 28 Mar 2017, 5:24pm Gallery: Matt cartoons, March 2017 Premium Gallery 28 Mar 2017, 1:20pm Gallery: Mission impossible: Abandoned Soviet space rocket in derelict hanger, in pictures News latest 28 Mar 2017, 8:40pm Donald Trump's border wall faces battle in Congress as White House unveils plan for $18 billion cuts in medical research and infrastructure to pay for it 00:28 28 Mar 2017, 8:26pm Disgruntled passenger obstructs path of Putney bus for 20 minutes 28 Mar 2017, 7:34pm MPs who fail to declare outside interests should be treated like criminals, Westminster committee warns 28 Mar 2017, 7:17pm Samsung store suffers fire mishap a day before Galaxy S8 launch  28 Mar 2017, 7:01pm Major restaurants installing music systems which make you spend 10pc more  28 Mar 2017, 6:51pm Comment: Generation Putin has been betrayed by the scale of corruption in Russia Con Coughlin Premium 28 Mar 2017, 6:49pm Israel warns its citizens to get out of Sharm el-Sheikh and Red Sea amid fears of terror attack on tourists 28 Mar 2017, 6:44pm Pioneering heart surgeon denies rape and sexual assault at hospital 28 Mar 2017, 6:43pm Comment: The Article 50 negotiations are going to be a roller-coaster.

By the end of the year, space engineers hope to fulfil one of their greatest dreams. They plan to land a privately funded probe on the moon and send a small robot craft trundling over the lunar surface. If they succeed they will open up the exploitation of the moon for mining and ultimately human colonisation – and earn $20m prize money as winners of the Google Lunar XPrize. Out of the 29 companies that originally entered the competition, only five remain in contention. Each has until the end of 2017, the XPrize deadline, to launch its robot mission. It is an extraordinarily ambitious task. To date, not a single piece of any competitor’s hardware has flown outside Earth’s atmosphere, while two of the rockets earmarked to send craft to the moon have still to undergo test launches. As a result, many observers now wonder if anyone will win the Google XPrize given its tight timetable. Naveen Jain, co-founder of Moon Express – one of the five remaining competitors – is bullish, however. “We have tested our lander. We have tried out all our hardware and software and we have raised all the money we need to complete the mission. We are very confident.” The rules for the Google XPrize are straightforward. The winning robot craft must be the first to land on the moon and must then travel 500 metres over the lunar surface while sending back high-resolution images to Earth. At the same time, at least 90% of the mission must be commercially funded. The first team to succeed in this undertaking will win $20m, with further bonuses on offer. For example, a spacecraft that not only lands successfully but also survives a lunar night – which lasts for two Earth weeks when temperatures drop to minus 173 degrees – will win an extra prize of several million dollars. The aim of the exercise is “to incentivise space entrepreneurs to create a new era of affordable access to the moon and beyond,” say the organisers. It was set up 10 years ago, attracting considerable interest from aerospace investors. Most would-be competitors have since dropped out as the technical hurdles of the mission have proved too onerous. The five now left are:  ■ TeamIndus of India. Set up by dotcom entrepreneur Rahul Narayan, this outfit is backed by a several major Indian businesses. ■ Hakuto of Japan, which has developed its own four-wheel rover for trundling over the lunar surface ■ Israel’s SpaceIL. It has received substantial backing from American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and it wants to create an “Apollo moment” when it lands, thus inspiring the young to pursue careers in science and engineering. ■ Synergy Moon, an international concern with individuals from 15 countries, which will use a Neptune 8 rocket, built and launched by Interorbital Systems, to carry a lander and at least one rover to the moon. ■ Moon Express. Funded by Naveen Jain, the founder of dotcom search giant InfoSpace, it has set its sights on mining the moon for minerals and is the only competitor yet to receive permission from the US Federal Aviation Administration to land a craft on the lunar surface. Most of the challengers have invested sums up to $60m to develop their technology – though several have to finalise this funding. The benefits of taking part in the competition were nevertheless clear, said the Astronomer Royal, Martin Rees. “Challenge prizes like these are very good ideas. They have played major roles in developing driverless cars and the development of private launch systems like Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and they could do the same for roboticised space missions.” In future, said Rees, humanity would depend more and more on robot craft to assemble telescopes and to build orbiting solar power plants and to operate mines on asteroids. “Such operations are not likely to be in use for many decades, but challenges like these definitely help to get things moving.” It remains to be seen if any of the missions make it to the moon by the end of the year. All are rudimentary in concept, are largely untested and employ a wide variety of technologies. Moon Express will not use a rover to cross the lunar surface, for example. It will employ the craft’s rocket engines to hop across it. Similarly, its craft will be launched on a Rocket Lab electron launcher, from New Zealand, while Synergy Moon’s rocket will blast off from an ocean launch pad. This wide variety of approaches has left some bemused observers viewing the competition as a lunar Wacky Races. For his part, Moon Express’s chief executive Bob Richards acknowledged that its lander did look a bit like a flying washing machine. “Actually it looks more like R2-D2. But it will work,” he insisted. However, one awkward task that faced past lunar efforts – returning to Earth – will not be a problem that will affect these competitors. Yes, they will have to overcome the headaches of launching a spacecraft from Earth and they will have to land it gently on the moon, a world that lacks atmosphere and thus precludes the use of parachutes. However, there is no requirement in the Google XPrize regulations for competitors to bring their craft back to Earth. They will be left on the lunar surface as possible visiting sights for future tourists. “That does make things a little easier,” said Rees. “Returning to Earth was the real nail-biting part of the Apollo missions. At least competitors won’t have to worry about that.” As to follow-up missions, competitors are also divided. SpaceIL says that if it wins the XPrize, the money will be invested – not on further space missions but into educational grants. By contrast, Moon Express has pledged that regardless of winning the prize or not it intends to embark on a long-term strategy of mining on the moon. “This effort is just the start,” said Richards. “We see a real future up there.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

That’s a problem for media giant Google, says Simon Wilson. What’s happened? Revelations that advertisements from such respectable outfits as the UK government, Sainsbury’s and L’Oréal were featured alongside inappropriate YouTube content – including white supremacist groups and jihadist preachers – have caused a host of firms and organisations to pull their digital advertising from the Google-owned video site. Among the 250-and-counting organisations to suspend their advertisements include the BBC, The Guardian newspaper, Marks & Spencer, McDonald’s, Channel 4, Tesco, Audi and several banks. Many of the companies boycotting Google had discovered only by reading The Times’s investigation that their advertising budget was being used to place banner advertisements over these videos, thus indirectly funding extremists and damaging the prestige of their brands. What was Google thinking? It wasn’t. Like much of the digital advertising industry, Google uses “programmatic advertising”. When you buy advertising space on TV, radio or in a print publication, a representative of the firm, such as a media buyer working on behalf of an advertising agency, will negotiate with the media outlet’s advertising team specifying where and when it will run and the cost. In digital advertising, digital trading desks at media buying agencies still plan, book and execute campaigns on behalf of clients, but the specific slots where advertisements appear are allocated by computer algorithms and a complex automated auction-style clearing system. How does that work? When you click on a webpage, advertisers in effect bid for space on that page based on cookies and other tags tracking your online activities with the aim of serving you advertisements you’ll want to see. An auction is held and the “winning” advertisement is transmitted in milliseconds. All this is “as complex as it is… fast”, says The Economist. “Thousands of firms jostle to analyse consumer data and buy, sell and monitor” advertisements, and an advertising impression sold programmatically can change hands 15 times before being bought by an advertiser and served. That brings both thrilling innovation, and massive headaches, like this incident. Will the publicity damage Google? Google has apologised and sworn to do better, but it’s too early to say how serious the fallout will be. Given that print publishers have seen their advertising earnings collapse due to the advance of Google and Facebook, newpapers have every interest in keeping the story running. On the other hand, for advertisers keen to reach digital audiences, Google and Facebook have huge power, accounting for almost 60% of the £11bn UK digital advertising market and 90% of new spending, says market research firm eMarketer. Michael Roth, CEO of global advertising giant Interpublic, told the FT that the scandal is unlikely to presage a collapse in Google revenues, but that it would lose business if it can’t fix the issue of extremist content. It doesn’t help that the scandal is just one of the issues now facing the digital advertising sector. What are the others? Integrity and trust. Digital should help make advertising more effective, with more personalised and targeted advertisements. The problem is that while advertisers have gained in some ways (the ability to personalise) they’ve lost in others (the certainty that a claimed viewer has seen their advertisement). There are no agreed standards and metrics for what counts as a “view”, how much of the advertisement has to be visible on the screen and for how long, or on how these metrics should be verified by third parties (in the way that has been standard in the TV industry for decades). Worse, an advertiser can’t even be sure that their advertisement, if it hasn’t been prevented from appearing by blocking technology, was viewed by a human as opposed to a “bot” (see below). Are advertisers restive? The rumblings coming from the biggest global advertiser of all – Procter & Gamble (P&G), which shelled out $10bn in 2015 on advertising its consumer brands – are ominous. Back in 2012, P&G was full of the joys of the newish technology, telling Wall Street it expected to make $1bn in savings by targeting customers through digital advertising and social media. But now it’s a different story. At a recent advertising jamboree, P&G’s chief brand officer, Marc Pritchard, attacked what he called the “exponential increase in crap” associated with online marketing, and the “even crappier” viewing experience. “Together [as advertisers] we’re now spending $70bn on digital adverts”, he noted, but complained that “we serve advertisements to consumers through a non-transparent media supply chain with spotty compliance to common standards, unreliable measurements, hidden rebates, and new inventions like bots driving fraud”. His message was clear: “frankly, the jig is up” and the days of “giving digital a pass are over”. How big a problem is fraud? Global spending on web advertisements will surpass expenditure on TV advertising for the first time this year. TV spending has remained steady for the past five years, at around $170bn. Web spending has more than doubled, from $80bn in 2012 to a forecast $200bn in 2017, says ZenithOptimedia, a media agency. Yet an industry investigation last year found that up to 37% of online impressions are made by bots – ie, programmes that “visit” sites to drive up traffic metrics and fraudulently entice more advertising. That’s not a sustainable position, says Leila Abboud of Bloomberg. “The flow of money from TV and print to the web could slow or reverse.” If advertising and media agencies can’t be transparent about how they spend money, “contracts will be cancelled or revised”.

Mobile by Patrick Holland March 22, 2017 10:31 AM PDT New features in Android O Curious to see what's new in Android O? Here are five features from the latest developer preview of Android. by Lexy Savvides 1:31 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF It's a fun day when the developer preview for an upcoming operating system is released. Whether you're a developer or not you get a sneak peek at upcoming features that may soon be coming to your phone. Google released Tuesday the developer version of its next Android OS currently called just O. Some of O's most exciting features are better battery life, easier controls for notifications and picture-in-picture video for both phones and tablets. There's no guarantee all these features will be in the full release some time later this year. 1. Battery life Improving the battery life is one of the biggest and most welcomed features of Android O. Similar to iOS, Android O will limit and manage what apps do in the background while multiple apps are open. This is one of those "behind the curtain" features that you'll appreciate even if you can't see exactly how it works. For example, if you are using Instagram but have Google Maps open in the background, location services will update the location less frequently for Maps to keep it from draining your battery as fast. 2. Notifications channels Notifications have always been one of the perennial strong features of Android. In O, you can group your notifications into channels or as Google describes it: "app-defined categories for notification content". So if you had a channel of apps that are all "news" related, you could interact and control notification settings for all the apps in the news channel at once. Google 3. Snooze notifications Sometimes as wonderful as notifications are, you just need them to be quiet for a little while. Android O gives you the ability to snooze notifications simply by sliding your finger across a notification and then selecting how long to snooze it for: 15, 30 or 60 minutes. 4. Picture-in-picture While we've seen picture-in-picture video for the iPad, we've yet to see it fully functioning on a phone. Android O brings the ability to keep a video playing while interacting with another app. To what extent this feature is incorporated by video apps like Netflix and HBO Now remains to be seen. But hopefully you'll be able to keep watching "Game Of Thrones" as you check the weather to see if winter is indeed coming. (Spoiler: It is.) 5. Lock screen shortcuts On the lock screen in Android Nougat there is a microphone icon for quick access to Google Assistant and a camera icon for quick access to take a picture. Android O will allow you to customize your lock screen with even more shortcuts. 6. Autofill system wide If you use a password manager app, Android O gives you easy yet secure access to it across your device via autofill. You will be able to select which password manager app you want to take advantage of a system wide autofill feature. This is similar to the way you can now select which keyboard to use across your apps on your phone. 7. Wide-gamut color What the heck is wide-gamut color? Exactly. While this feature might not mean much to you now, it's really about future proofing. As displays improve with newer phones and tablets, your apps will be able to take full advantage of all the colors and their subtleties. Just imagine how amazing all your cat pics will look. 8. HiFi Bluetooth audio Your phone will now be able to wirelessly stream higher quality audio. Obviously, to fully hear the higher quality depends on the quality of the audio recording and the speaker or headphone with which you're listening to it. This is a big plus for any audiophiles out there. 9. Keyboard shortcuts Good news if you use a keyboard with an Android tablet: Android O gives better support for developers to make navigation and shortcuts easier to use via a physical keyboard. Could this pave the way for Android laptops, and maybe Chromebooks? What's next for O? This is a very early build of Android O so we can't say what other features will be added in the future. It's so early, that we don't even know what sweet treat Android O is named after! Oreo? Oatmeal cookie? Orangesicle? We have a few guesses as to what O could actually be. We are bound to learn more in depth about the features we highlighted as well as any new ones at Google's annual software developer conference I/O, in May.

Here’s how to protect yourself against them, whether they come from opportunist thieves or state-sponsored spies. 1. Keep up to date – and don’t open up holes yourself When it comes to protecting yourself against hackers, step one is always to install software updates as soon as they become available: that’s as true on smartphones as it is on computers. Yes, updating can be a tiresome and intrusive process, and it sometimes brings annoying changes to the interface that you’re used to. All the same, a huge proportion of successful hacks exploit vulnerabilities that have already been patched; exposing yourself unnecessarily is just daft. I’d also strongly advise against using unofficial tools to “root” your phone (known as “jailbreaking” on iOS), unless you know exactly what you’re doing. On a rooted phone, technical safeguards can be defeated, allowing apps to perform all sorts of actions that are normally prohibited – and that can include snooping on your personal data. 2. Be careful of what you install When you install a smartphone app, you may be asked to grant it various permissions, including the ability to read your files, access your camera or listen in to your microphone. There are legitimate uses for these capabilities, but they’re potentially open to abuse: think before you approve the request. That applies especially to Android users, as Google’s app-vetting process isn’t as strict as Apple’s, and there have been reports of malicious apps spending months on the Play Store before being spotted and taken down. Android also lets you install apps from third-party sources: this allows services such as Amazon’s competing Appstore to operate, but it also provides an easy way for rogue apps to get onto your phone. I’d strongly advise against installing anything from an unfamiliar website. 3. Review what’s already on your phone Even if the apps on your phone seemed simple and safe when you installed them, subsequent updates could have turned them into something more sinister. Take two minutes to review all the apps on your smartphone, and see which permissions they’re using: on iOS, you’ll find lots of relevant information under Settings > Privacy. On Android, it’s harder to get an overview of which apps have which permissions, but there are plenty of security apps that help here, including free packages from Avast and McAfee. These tools can also jump in and alert you if you’re trying to install an app that’s known to be malicious, and warn you if a “phishing” attack is trying to trick you into entering a password into an untrusted app or webpage. 4. Make it hard for intruders to get in If a thief gets physical access to your phone, they can cause all sorts of trouble. For a start, your email app probably contains a trove of personal information. Make sure your phone is locked when not in use: both Android and iOS can be set to require a six-digit passcode. Your device may offer other options too, like fingerprints or facial recognition. Such methods aren’t perfect – a really determined hacker could copy your fingerprints from a drinking glass, or trick a camera with a photograph of you – but they’re a lot better than nothing. And be wary of “smart unlock” features, which automatically unlock your phone when you’re at home, or when your smartwatch is near; these could let a thief bypass your unlock code altogether. 5. Be prepared to track and lock your phone Plan ahead, so even if your phone is stolen, you know your data is safe. One option is to set your phone to automatically erase itself after a certain number of incorrect attempts to enter the passcode. If that seems a bit drastic, don’t forget that both Apple and Google operate “find my device” services that can locate your phone on a map, and remotely lock or erase it. For Apple users, this is accessed through the iCloud website – you can check it’s enabled on the phone in Settings > iCloud > Find My iPhone. Android users can access Google’s service at google.co.uk/android/devicemanager. You can also make a missing phone ring – helpful for drawing attention to the thief, or tracking down a handset that’s been merely mislaid. We all know there's a risk involved in using an open wireless network. But you may not realise how severe it is 6. Don’t leave online services unlocked Auto-login is a very convenient feature, especially since a virtual keyboard can make typing passwords a chore. It’s also a huge liability: an intruder simply needs to open your browser to gain access to all your online accounts. Ideally, therefore, you shouldn’t use auto-login features at all. If you must, use a password manager app that requires you to regularly re-enter a master password. And don’t use the same password for more than one app or service: if that one password gets found out, it can be used to access a whole range of private information. This applies even if you’re perfectly scrupulous about keeping your smartphone secure: hackers regularly break into online services to steal user credentials, which they then try out on other sites. 7. Adopt an alter ego If you’ve followed this advice so far, it should be very difficult for anyone to get into your phone. However, some major hacks have been pulled off without any access to the victim at all. If someone can find out (for example) your date of birth, home town and mother’s maiden name – all stuff that can be easily picked up from a site like Facebook – that’s often all they need to reset a password and start breaking into your accounts. You can see off such attacks by fictionalising your past with details that are unlikely to be guessed; perhaps, for the purposes of security, you were born in 1999 to Mrs Victoria Beckham, née Adams. Just remember what you claimed, or you could end up locking yourself out. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Personal information can easily be gleaned from sites such as Facebook. 8. Beware open wifi We all know there’s a risk involved in using an open wireless network. But you may not realise how severe it is: anyone in the vicinity can snoop on what you’re doing online. This sort of attack demands specialist software and skills, so it’s unlikely to be a hazard in your local cafe, but it’s not a danger that can be ignored. If you’re at all doubtful about a wireless network, don’t connect – stick with your phone’s mobile internet connection. Or use a VPN tool such as CyberGhost or TunnelBear (both available free for Android and iOS). These tools route your traffic through a private encrypted channel, so even if someone is monitoring your traffic they won’t be able to see what you’re up to. 9. Don’t let lockscreen notifications give the game away Lots of apps pop up messages and notifications on your phone’s lockscreen. It’s worth thinking about what these notifications may reveal. If you work for a big banking company, for example, a visible email from a work colleague or a meeting reminder tells a thief that this might be a particularly interesting phone to steal. On iOS, also consider disabling access to Siri from the lockscreen. Siri isn’t supposed to give away personal information before you enter your passcode to unlock the iPhone, but past hacks have let intruders use Siri to unlock the device, access details of contacts and view photos. It’s safest to shut the feature off entirely: you’ll find the option under Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Disable Siri on the Lockscreen. 10. Lock individual apps A strong passcode helps keep thieves out of your phone, but what if a stranger snatches your phone while you’re using it? Or asks to borrow it to check a website, then bolts off down the street? On Android, as a second line of defence, you can lock individual apps, so even if someone can get past your lockscreen, they can’t open your email or banking app without a second password. This capability isn’t built into the OS, but there are plenty of free apps that provide it, such as AVG AntiVirus Free. iOS users can’t directly lock individual apps, but check out Folder Lock – free on the App Store – which can password-protect your documents and folders, reducing the amount of information a thief can access. 11. Get a warning when your phone goes walkies If you’re on the fence about investing in a smartwatch, here’s a little-known feature that could swing it: Apple Watch and Android Wear devices can warn you immediately if they lose Bluetooth contact with your phone. If you get this notification while you’re in a public place, there’s a good chance someone’s just picked your pocket, and is currently making off with your phone. The device will normally be less than 50 metres away when the connection drops, so the warning gives you a chance to ring the phone right away, hopefully drawing attention to the thief and prompting them to jettison it. Failing that, you can lock it before the culprit has a chance to start trying to break in and steal your data. 12. Keep an eye on things behind the scenes No matter how cautious you are, you can’t completely eradicate the danger of your phone being hacked – not unless you refuse to install any apps or visit any websites. What you can do is supplement your on-device security measures with an online service. LogDog – available for both Android and iOS – is an app that monitors your identity on sites such as Gmail, Dropbox and Facebook. It alerts you to suspicious activity, such as logins from unfamiliar places, giving you a chance to step in and change your credentials before serious harm can be done. As a bonus, LogDog will also scan your email and highlight messages containing sensitive data such as credit card details and passwords, which you can then purge to ensure they don’t fall into the wrong hands.

Follow Lynsey Related City Talk Scottish Development International Talk Can you get your teeth into the UK's £322 billion data sector? Google has been under fire from advertisers and politicians (Source: Getty) Lynsey Barber Top ministers have laid into Google, Facebook and Twitter, saying they must do more to tackle content which promotes terrorism and extremism. Foreign minister Boris Johnson labelled them "disgusting", telling the Sunday Times: "They need to stop just making money out of prurient violent material.” Meanwhile home secretary Amber Rudd, writing in the Telegraph, warned the tech firms must do more in the wake of the terrorist attack on parliament. Read more: Google will hire "significant numbers of people" to review content "Each attack confirms again the role that the internet is playing in serving as a conduit, inciting and inspiring violence, and spreading extremist ideology of all kinds," she said. "But we can’t do it by ourselves. We need the help of social media companies, the Googles, the Twitters, the Facebooks of this world. And the smaller ones, too: platforms such as Telegram, Wordpress and Justpaste.it." Both ministers called on the firms to take a more proactive approach to finding extremist material. None of the tech companies proactively look for such content, acting only when thy are alerted by others who have flagged it. But they have also been criticised for not acting fast enough to remove it when issues have been raised. "They need to develop new systems and algorithms to detect this stuff and remove it. They are not acting when they are tipped off," said Johnson. Rudd said: "We need them to take a more proactive and leading role in tackling the terrorist abuse of their platforms. We need them to develop further technology solutions. We need them to set up an industry-wide forum to address the global threat." She will meet with the firms this week to ask them to do more. Read more: Google's top boss in Europe has apologised to its advertising clients It comes as the advertising boycott of Google spread further, with several US brands pulling their spending from YouTube. Numerous brands in the UK pulled advertising last week after adverts were found next to extremist content. PepsiCo, Walmart, Starbucks joined AT&T, Verizon and Volkswagen over the weekend. Late on Friday Moody's warned the loss of notable advertisers from YouTube is credit negative for parent company Alphabet, but does not impact its AA2 rating. Google has promised to better tackle such content and give advertisers greater controls over where they appear, but stopped short of saying it will proactively police it. More than 400 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute. Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt is the most high-profile tech executive yet to weigh in on the matter.

After a torrid week or so, YouTube could do with some "corrective advertising" of its own. Because the video upload and sharing behemoth has attracted a considerable amount of negative publicity since it emerged that its clients' ads were appearing next to objectionable video content. It all began when the Times of London reported on St Patrick's Day that taxpayer-funded British government agency adverts were unwittingly funding extremists on the video platform. Its investigation revealed rape apologists, anti-Semites and banned hate preachers were getting money from the ads through the YouTube revenue sharing model. According to the Times, a YouTube poster typically receives $7.60 for every 1,000 views of an advert displayed with it. Multiply that by the hundreds of thousands of views that some of the videos had attracted and it translated into a nice revenue stream for the recipients. The response from the advertisers, including the Home Office, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and Transport for London, was swift. They pulled their ads from the platform pending reassurances from YouTube – sending its parent Google an understandable and understood message that this was not acceptable. Their reaction was quickly mirrored bylarge corporate advertisers around the world. AT&T, Lyft, Johnson & Johnson, Verizon, GlaxoSmithKline, Volkswagen, Toyota, BBC, Ford and many others were among those to react similarly, with plenty of others currently seeking urgent clarification from YouTube. Even here, the big advertising houses reacted with annoyance to the move, with Core Media even pulling all its ad campaigns from YouTube. The problem focuses on so-called programmatic advertising – an automated software based system that allows companies to bid for or buy digital ad spots and in the process specify the profile of the audience they want to see it. The ads then find, and in some cases follow, targets on the internet, ensuring maximum exposure at minimal cost and fuss. Despite a complicated intermediary structure, it is in theory an excellent solution for advertisers – except, that is, when their ads end up appearing beside offensive content that is likely to harm their brand. Google says it has safeguards in place to prevent that from happening, but as the events of the past few days show, they don't work effectively. "What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match," said the chairman of Google parent, Alphabet, Eric Schmidt in an interview with Fox Business Network. "We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time, and so I think we’re going to be okay." We’ll see. To be fair, Google has been reasonably quick out of the blocks on this, apologising to companies who have been damaged by the affair and outlining steps it is taking to remedy the situation. It said it was taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content and removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking people on race, religion, gender and other grounds. The company also plans to introduce new tools to allow advertisers to more easily and consistently manage where their ads appear across YouTube and the web. Its intent may be genuine, and granted, monitoring the 400 hours of video being uploaded each minute is a mammoth task. But it does all smack more than a little of a case of nudging the stable door shut when the horse is already in the next county. Either the company knew this problem was happening and chose to ignore it on the basis that advertisers weren't raising it as an issue. Or it didn't know because it wasn't watching user uploaded content, as well as its end products and services closely enough. Whatever the answer, it doesn't look good and is likely to have cost the company significant lost revenue. It's also knocked 4% or well over $20bn off the company's value on the stock market in the past week. Major advertisers will be correctly watching closely to ensure the issue is resolved before they dip their toe back in the market. They will also be correctly asking searching questions of other platforms where their ads appear, like Facebook, for example. It has come under not-unrelated scrutiny recently over the profits being made by fake news websites using the social network to spread their material. Tech companies need to stop hiding behind fig-leaf excuses like their "rapid growth makes it difficult" or "the right to free speech has to be protected", and take responsibility for ridding their platforms of hateful and racist speech. YouTube is thought to be a major cash cow for Google, because of the explosion in online video consumption. Indeed, the digital advertising market last year was worth $178bn, up 17% on 2015, making it a hugely lucrative space for people to be operating in, particularly when video is involved. But right now traditional media outlets like TV, radio and newspapers must be rubbing their hands, as they prepare to mop up some of that courtesy of a temporary (or perhaps longer term) bounce of advertisers shying away from online channels. Video may have killed the radio star. But right now online video is killing itself.

Not only does it have an unlimited supply of information, but the apps they produce are used by millions of people every day. Now, one of its most popular apps, Google Maps, has brought in a new feature which means you can track your friends and family. It means you can use the app to broadcast your location in real time- letting friends, relatives or even a spouse know where you are. Those concerned about privacy might not be too quick to enable the feature. Thankfully, it's not a mandatory setting. In order to share your location, you have to have your phone's GPS-enabled location tracker switched on. Read: Everybody's laughing at this Sainsbury's daffodil warning From there, you can tap on the blue dot that represents you and choose "share location" - and set how long you want it shared for. Google Maps will then give you the option to share to contacts directly through the app or via a link through your normal messenger apps. "When you're sharing your location, the people you've chosen to share with will see you on their map," a spokesperson for Google said. "You'll see an icon above the compass on your own map reminding you that you're actively sharing your location. "You can change your mind and stop sharing at any time - it's entirely up to you." If you keep your location shared indefinitely then Google will send you an email every three weeks to remind you that it's activated.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement About half of all Android phones got a security update in 2016 (and half didn’t) 03/23/2017 at 2:37 PM by Brad Linder 10 Comments Google says more than 735 million Android devices received at least one security update in 2016. That sounds pretty good… until you realize there are more than 1.4 billion active Android devices in the wild. In other words, around half of those Android devices did not receive a security update over the course of a year. That’s despite Google’s relatively recent decision to start pushing out monthly security updates for Android. Unfortunately, while Google can deliver those updates directly to Nexus, Pixel, and Android One devices, the company has to rely on third-parties to bring updates to most phones. The situation means that when hackers or security researchers uncover security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious hackers, many Android phone or tablet users never receive a patch to fix the flaw. It’s not a particularly surprising revelation: anyone who watches the Android smartphone market has known for a while that some phone makers are slow to push out software updates, and some never do it at all. For example, most iPhone users are running the latest version of iOS. But even though Google released Android 7.0 Nougat more than half a year ago, less than 3 percent of Android devices are using the latest version of Google’s operating system. The majority of Android users are still on Lollipop or Marshmallow, and even Android 4.4 KitKat and Android 4.x Jelly Bean have a larger user base than Android 7.0 Nougat. The good news is that Google says that 50-percent rate is about twice what it was during the previous year, and the company is hoping to work with partners to push security updates to even more phones in 2017. But if you’re concerned about smartphone security (and you should be), then your best bet is to either buy a Nexus, Pixel, or Android One device or make sure to buy from one of the handful of phone makers that actually releases monthly security updates shortly after Google makes them available. Google says some of the Android devices that had update rates between 60 and 95 percent by the end of 2016 included: Google Pixel and Pixel XL Google Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, and Nexus 6P Motorola Moto Z Droid Oppo A33W OnePlus 3 Samsung Galaxy S7 Asus Zenfone 3 bq Aquaris M5 Vivo V3Max LG V20 Sony Xperia X Compact Or I guess you could buy an iPhone.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 10 Comments on "About half of all Android phones got a security update in 2016 (and half didn’t)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest Dan Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Even Google’s Nexus phones don’t get updates as long as iPhones so I just switched OS/brands. For the most part, a smartphone is a smartphone so not much different in the main experience. Hope to keep the iPhone until it breaks vs. when it stops getting security/bug fixes.

The difference is I can still easily install an up to date OS on my old Galaxy Nexus, whereas getting the same to work on my out of date iDevice is getting harder. My 1st gen iPad Mini has been cut off from updates, and actually the last couple major updates significantly slowed it down. Granted, flashing ROMs is not for every consumer out there, but I think there are significant advantages to getting outside the Apple walled garden for this reason and others.

Done that and I don’t plan on dealing with driver and other common issues with ROMs. Not worth most people’s time really.

What’s the point of paying a premium if the phone just gets messed up after a couple of years? Might as well spend less and have an otherwise unrestricted phone.

Granted this is not the same as iOS updates which are maintained by Apple themselves but it is still reasonable. Phones tend to become somewhat outdated after 2-3 years anyway.

And that you’d be lucky if your flagship Blackberry, LG, SONY, and ASUS gets an upgrade. So avoid those too. And that a few very lucky handsets from a few Chinese vendors get an upgrade. Too unpredictable, should avoid them too. So you’re essentially left with Samsung Galaxy S-flagship for slow upgrades. Or the OnePlus devices for availability and support issues. Or just a straight Nexus/Pixel phone. ……no wonder there are more people converting from Android to iPhone rather than the opposite.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Preliminary root released for Android O developer preview (Nexus 5X and 6P) 03/23/2017 at 9:19 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment Just two days after Google released the first developer preview of Android O, it’s been rooted. Well, sort of. Developer Chainfire has found a way to root the Google Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P when they’re running the developer preview, but this method does not work with the Pixel or Pixel XL smartphones… at least not yet. In order to root the Nexus phones, you’ll need a device with an unlocked bootloader running Google’s Android O Developer Preview 1 software with the TWRP custom recovery. You can then download the latest version of SuperSU from Chainfire’s XDA-Developers thread and flash it using TWRP. Note that installing SuperSU doesn’t necessarily mean that every app that requires root access will work properly in Android O. There are some changes to the operating system that means some apps will probably need to be updates by their developers. SuperSU for Android O is also described as a work in progress, so it could be a while before all the kinks are worked out. But you could say the same thing about Android O at this point. via @ChainfireXDA Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS Search for: How to master…Android Wear 2.0 Amaze friends and astonish pets with your newfound mastery of Google’s smartwatch OS… 26 March 2017 by Stuff Staff The first time you try on Android Wear it can feel as thin as a cheap t-shirt from the supermarket discount aisle. It doesn’t have millions of apps like a phone. And it doesn’t have more power than some laptops… like a phone. But this isn’t a piece of cotton. It’s a smartwatch system with loads of depth hidden behind its ultra-simple shop front. Here are the tips and tricks you need to learn to get the most from Android Wear 2.0. LEVEL 1: BEGINNER Staring at your new Android Wear watch with a look of bafflement? Here’s where to start… 1) CHANGE YOUR FACE Ready for your smartwatch 101? One of the first things you’ll want to try is changing your watch’s face. Just swipe right-to-left on the watch face to bring up your array of ‘favourite’ faces. To start with there’ll just be a few in here. Scroll to the right and you can add more to this selection from the list of all the installed ones. Google’s own watch faces are pretty good if you don’t mind looking like the rest of the (small) smartwatch-owning crowd, but there are also loads more available to download from Google Play too. 2) USING THE WATCH AS A PHONE-UNLOCKER If you’re not too worried about your friends or co-workers tweeting about how much you love Bieber on your account as soon as your back is turned, you can make your phone auto-unlock whenever it’s connected to your watch. The phone is secure should you accidentally leave it somewhere, but you don’t have to type-in your pin or use the fingerprint scanner 700 times a day. All you need to do is add the watch as a ‘trusted’ device in the Secure Lock part of Settings on your phone. You can actually do this with any Bluetooth device, but a smartwatch is just about perfect for the job. 3) FIND YOUR PHONE Here’s a feature that stares you right in the face, but is still ignored by most of the smartwatch owners we know. It’s called Find My Phone and could end up being the feature you use most often if you’re, y’know, a bit scatty. It should come preinstalled on any Wear 2.0 watch (it’s called Find my Phone), and simply makes your phone ring after a few seconds: just to it doesn’t instantly start bleating in case you accidentally run the app. Smart. 4) STREAMLINE NOTIFICATIONS Getting notifications on your wrist can turn into a bit of a nightmare when Candy Crush starts complaining you’ve stopped playing every 4 hours. Thankfully, you can choose exactly which notifications get a boarding pass onto your wrist. You do this in the Android Wear app on your phone. Just tap the little cog icon at the top of the screen, then select Block App Notifications in the menu that pops-up. Here you can add to the blacklist of apps that send you notifications you really don’t need to see on your wrist. 5) CINEMA-PROOF YOUR SMARTWATCH If you’re in the cinema: don’t talk, don’t eat anything too noisy and don’t take your phone out to, well, do anything. Your smartwatch screen should be off too. Thankfully it takes about 1.5 seconds. Just swipe down, or flick your wrist down (with gestures enabled), from the watch face then tap the little icon that looks like a watch. This will kill the screen until you press the power button. 6) EKE OUT MORE BATTERY LIFE Want your smartwatch to last a week between charges? Don’t buy an Android Wear watch. The only ones that get close to this are those that can shrink back into basically being fitness trackers. Still, if you’re going on holiday and don’t want to have to charge the thing every day, your best bet is to turn off the always-on screen function. You get a worse smartwatch in return, but sometimes needs must, eh? Swipe down from the watch face, tap the little cog icon, then Display. Now un-toggle “Always-on screen” down at the bottom of this menu. 7) MAKE FRIENDS WITH GOOGLE ASSISTANT If you want to really get into the smartwatch life, you’re going to have to swallow your pride and embrace talking to your watch. Sorry. On the bright side, at least a Wear watch doesn’t talk back to you like Siri. There are two quick routes to accessing the Google digital assistant. You can just say “OK Google” while using the watch or, if you want to keep the chat to a minimum, just long-press the power button. LEVEL 2: INTERMEDIATE The foundations of your Android Wear mastery have been laid. Now it’s time to build some exterior walls… 8) FIND 100 NEW WATCH FACES Your Wear watch probably comes with a half dozen or so faces. And there’s a good chance a bunch of them look like an impersonation of the impersonation luxury watch you’d find for a tenner down at the local market. If you like the cod luxury watch look, that’s great. But there’s also an app that’ll give you easy access to a whole new galaxy of faces. It’s called Facer. Install this using the Play Store app then select Set Watch face from within the store app once it’s done. Skip back to the watch display and you’ll see… not much. But install the Facer app on your phone and you can sync over a new face in a few seconds. There’s even one based on Fallout 4’s pip-boy. 9) TURN IT INTO YOUR WALLET Want a new way to show off your smartwatch? Paying for stuff with it is much more effective than just getting its shiny bezel to glint in the sun. It’s all thanks to Android Pay, which lets you use a Wear watch like a contactless card. You’ll need sync a card to Android Pay using your phone and the Pay app, but can then buy items just by waving the watch over a contactless pad in a shop. Quickly double press the function button on your watch and it’ll zap over to the Pay app, saving you from fiddling around and holding up the queue like someone trying to pay in coppers. 10) TRACK YOUR SLEEP Wear watches aren’t really designed to track your sleep as standard, probably because some of them struggle to last 24 hours off a charge. You can force the watch to monitor your sleepy-time using a third-party app, though, called Sleep as Android. Download this right from the watch using the Google Play app, fire it up as you’re getting ready for bed and it’ll do the rest. For best results either wear the watch as you sleep or keep it by your pillow so it can monitor your movements. 11) CUSTOMISE YOUR WATCH FACES Android Wear watch faces are so customisable these days that they make the locks screen of your phone look rigour-mortis stiff. You can choose all sorts of information to pack into them, from boring-but-useful bits like your watch’s battery life to the number of calories you’ve munched through in the day. How? It’s because some of these little watch face widgets can actually pull-in data from other apps, like food logger Lifesum. To give your watch face a tweak, just flick horizontally to get to the watch face selection screen then tap the little cog icon under the one you want to use. You’ll see a Data option there that lets you choose these extra bits of info. 12) PERSONALISE YOUR APPS MENU Google’s solution to making an operating system that lives in a 1in screen but doesn’t burst at the seams is to keep the bits you use every day simple. You can’t make folders in the apps menu or fiddle with how the icons are arranged. But there is a trick to avoid having to scroll through 30 of the things every time you want to use an app. Your last-used app will end up right at the top of the screen as standard but you can also push a few favourites up there too. Just long-press on an app icon to give it this special ‘pinned’ badge. If there’s one trick to getting on with Wear 2.0 day-to-day, it’s this. 13) MASTER THE MAGIC BUTTON No two Android Wear watches are the same, and the latest version of the software is designed with this in mind. Does there seem to be a spare button on the thing? There’s a good chance you can customise what this does with about ten seconds of tweaking. Let’s take the Huawei Watch 2 as an example. It has an extra hardware button you can use to quick-launch any app you like in the Personalisation part of the Settings menu – you get to this by swiping down on the watch face and tapping the cog icon. Don’t just make do with whatever the manufacturer pre-selected if it doesn’t work for you. 14) CONTROL IT WITH A FLICK OF YOUR WRIST First world problem #10455: you have brownie mix all over your hands but desperately want to read the WhatsApp you just received on your watch. It’s heartbreaking. There’s a solution. Turn on ‘Wrist Gestures’ in the Settings menu and you can scroll up and down menus and between notifications with a sharp flick of your wrist. A twist away from you pulls up a notification from the watch face, for example. Give the watch a jangle-jangle triple waggle and it’ll head back to the watch face regardless of what’s currently on-screen too. 15) MASTER GOOGLE ASSISTANT Six useful things you can do with Google Assistant 1) Get directions – Ask to get somewhere and you’ll be plugged into Google Maps with step-by-step instructions on your watch. 2) Translations – Need to know what beer is in Spanish? No problem. 3) Set a timer or alarm – Time to bin the egg timer. 4) Send a message to or call someone – This one’s pretty obvious, but useful if you don’t mind treating a virtual assistant like a Mad Men PA. 5) Launch an app – No more scrolling down the apps menu, just say “launch X”. 6) Make a note – Here’s one of the better reasons to talk to your watch, especially as it’ll hook up with various note-taking apps like Microsoft OneNote Six fun things you can do with Google Assistant 1) Roll a virtual die – Ask the assistant to roll a die and it’ll give you a result. You can even choose how many sides the virtual die has too 2) Get truly awful random numbers – We tried asking for a random number between 1 and 1000 and got a result under 10 each time. The system is rigged 3) Ask how old celebs are – As long as Wikipedia knows, the Google Assistant will too 4) Get awful jokes – If Christmas cracker jokes are that bit too high-end for your tastes, ask for a joke 5) “Bark like a dog” – This is just one of the many easter eggs that earns you a silly response from the Google Assistant 6) “Read me a poem” – You won’t end up with a 1000-word epic, but it’s free ADVANCED Very good, young padawan, but you still have much to learn. Much to learn you still have… 16) GET YOUR IFTTT ON If there’s a feature that seems missing from your watch, there’s a good chance you can graft it in using IFTTT (which stands for “if this then that”). When something happens, it fires off a reaction in your watch. It sounds like programming, but you don’t even need to spend an hour learning how to do this. All you need to do is download the IFTTT phone app, and you can make a Wear-ready “applet” in a few seconds. Top uses include sending an alert if the weather report says it’s going to rain tomorrow, showing a quickie preview of any phone camera images on your watch’s screen and controlling your Hue lights with a press of a button in the IFTTT Wear app. 17) GET A NEW KEYBOARD To become a true jedi master of Android Wear, you have to get your head around typing on a keyboard that fits on half of a 1in screen. It’s as painful as that sounds, to start with. But just like an Android phone, you don’t have to put up with Google’s own version if you continue to find it has comfortable as jamming your pinkie in a pencil sharpener. Just search for ‘keyboard’ in Google Play on the watch and you’ll find a bunch of alternatives, including TouchPal. To use one of these keyboards, download them from Google Play, then go to Settings > Personalisation > Input methods and then flick ‘on’ the toggles of the new keyboard(s). Then simply long-press the keyboard while typing to change the one you actually use. 18) MAKE YOUR OWN WATCH FACE If you’re the kind of person who likes to accessorise their clothes with rips/badges/patches/pigeon feathers, you may well like the idea of making your very own watch face. This isn’t a Google feature, but something added by the clever folks at Androidslide. Download Watchmaker and you can not only make as many watch faces as you like, element by element, but also download reams of them made by other people. You’ll want the paid-for Premium version to actually make a fully-featured face, but given the flexibility on offer, we think it’s worth the few quid Androidslide charges. 19) GET WHATSAPP READY There’s no dedicated, standalone WhatsApp app for Wear yet, but you can actually read and reply to messages without one. When a message comes in, just tap on it (don’t swipe it off!) and then scroll down through your recent blabbering to see the reply options. There will be a few canned responses in here, but also the option to speak or type your own reply using Wear’s miniature keyboard. Just make sure you read what Google makes of your scrawl before sending, as it has come up with all sorts of weird replies so far based on our swipes. 20) MAKE YOUR FINGER A STYLUS One of the most ambitious parts of Wear 2.0 is a feature that lets you handwrite messages or search terms using your finger as a virtual pen. We wouldn’t suggest writing your first novel like this, but you need to give it a shot at least once. The easiest way to switch over to this kind of ‘keyboard’ is to go the Google Play app, tap the magnifying glass search icon then long-press the little keyboard icon. This takes you to the screen where you choose your keyboard. Select Google Handwriting and then get your best stylus finger ready. 21) BECOME A DEVELOPER Learning to develop Android apps and games takes time and effort. Loads of it. You can trick your watch into thinking you’re a dev in about 30 seconds, though. Flick down from the watch face, tap the cog icon and then scroll right down to the bottom of the Settings menu. Tap system, then About. Now repeatedly tap the Build Number entry and after a few seconds you’ll see a prompt telling you you’re a developer. Now you just wait for the millions in royalties to roll in… Not really. What this does is to open up a Developer Options menu in Settings. You’ll want to leave most of the options alone, but can do things like force the watch screen to stay on while charging and control how quick animation transitions are.

Complaints which defame judiciary should be brought to the notice of the High Court Registry which in turn would inform Google and YouTube about these objectionable video clips, said the full bench headed by Chief Justice Manjula Chellur. The court was hearing a contempt petition filed by Bombay Bar Association (BBA) challenging a video clip on YouTube which purportedly showed proceedings in a courtroom of a high court and levelled allegations of corruption against the judge. BBA counsel Srihari Aney informed the court that despite its earlier order such video clips were still being uploaded on websites and that it should be immediately stopped. The bench then directed YouTube and Google to ensure that such video clips are removed immediately if brought to their notice by the high court registry. The court had earlier issued notices to YouTube and search engine Google, seeking their response as to why action for contempt of court should not be initiated against them. The petition sought contempt action against the persons who recorded and uploaded the video on YouTube levelling allegations of corruption against Justice S J Kathawala of the high court. “The 38-minute video uploaded last week by Right Mirror copies the format of a news channel and shows a person acting as anchor and taking interviews of several persons including lawyer Nilesh Ojha making scandalous remarks against judges of this high court,” said the petition. A division bench of the high court had last month also ordered YouTube and other respondents to remove this video clip immediately. “Considering the scandalous and contemptuous nature of the video, we are inclined to order the respondents to forthwith remove the offending video,” the court had said.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo By Bloomberg News Mar 24, 2017 at 4:08 pm | Print View Major advertisers across Europe and Asia are still appearing alongside extremist YouTube videos days after technology giant Google said it was taking steps to protect its clients from inadvertently supporting hate. An anti-Semitic clip claiming the existence of a “Jewish World Order” was featured alongside advertisements in Germany from insurer AXA, oil company Total in France, Range Rover vehicles in South Africa, footwear retailer Skopunkten and website Tradera in Sweden, Bloomberg searches of YouTube from each country found on Thursday. The video was also paired with brands in Asia — Castrol lubricants in India and Cow & Gate infant formula in Hong Kong. A separate sermon by preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril, who according to U.S. prosecutors once took credit for a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, can be viewed alongside advertisements from Nissan in Sweden and wireless carrier MTN Group in South Africa. Meanwhile, the Islamophobic English Defence League gathers support from advertisers Total, Netflix, IBM and watchmaker Tag Heuer International in France. The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding across the globe at a pace Alphabet’s Google has struggled to match in its response. On Thursday, as Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said Google could “get pretty close” to guaranteeing companies’ ads won’t be placed near hateful material, advertisers throughout Europe were confronting more than a dozen new examples and scrambling to protect their brands. “We didn’t know that our ads were played in this context,” Axa spokeswoman Anja Kroll said in an email. “We have immediately arranged for an update of the filters and stopped the delivery” of ads with these videos because “diversity, tolerance and openness are values that are of key importance for us and that we practice daily.” While Axa hasn’t pulled its ads from YouTube, the German unit is using “blacklist” filters to prevent its ads from appearing next to extremist, racist or other undesired content, Kroll said. In this case, she said, the filters apparently failed. Like what you're reading?

Sign up now Menu ARN To punish Symantec, Google may distrust a third of the web's SSL certificates To punish Symantec, Google may distrust a third of the web's SSL certificates After the latest incident of improper certificate issuance, search giant loses confidence in the world's largest certificate authority Lucian Constantin (ARN) 26 March, 2017 16:40 - - - - print email Distributors Anyware Corporation Aquion Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Synnex Topstar Computer International Comments Google is considering a harsh punishment for repeated incidents in which Symantec or its certificate resellers improperly issued SSL certificates. A proposed plan is to force the company to replace all of its customers’ certificates and to stop recognising the extended validation (EV) status of those that have it. According to a Netcraft survey from 2015, Symantec is responsible for about one in every three SSL certificates used on the web, making it the largest commercial certificate issuer in the world. As a result of acquisitions over the years the company now controls the root certificates of several formerly standalone certificate authorities including VeriSign, GeoTrust, Thawte and RapidSSL. SSL/TLS certificates are used to encrypt the connections between browsers and HTTPS-enabled websites and also to verify that users are actually visiting the websites they intended to and not spoofed versions. These certificates are issued by organisations known as certificate authorities that are trusted by default in browsers and operating systems. The process of issuing and managing certificates is governed by rules created by the CA/Browser Forum, an organization whose members include browser vendors and certificate authorities. When those rules are violated, browser and OS vendors can revoke trust in the offending certificates and sanction the responsible certificate authorities, going as far as kicking them out of their root certificate stores. Google said that an investigation into a recent incident indicates that Symantec has not upheld security practices expected of certificate authorities, such as validating domain control, auditing logs for evidence of unauthorised issuance, and minimizing the ability for the issuance of fraudulent certificates. Read more Melbourne cloud migration specialist to acquire WA's Cirralto Business Services If Google's plan is put into practice, millions of existing Symantec certificates will become untrusted over the next 12 months in Google Chrome. This will be a gradual process where every new Chrome release will distrust a new batch of certificates starting with Chrome 59, which will revoke trust in certificates that have a validity period of over 33 months. This will put enormous pressure on Symantec, as the company will have to contact all customers, validate their identity and the ownership of their domains all over again, and replace their existing certificates with new ones, most likely at no cost. Some companies will likely have problems replacing their certificates on such short notice, as they might be used in payment terminals and other hard-to-reach embedded devices. Read more Microsoft is playing Windows hardball In addition to that, Symantec might have to refund customers who paid for EV certificates that will no longer be recognised as such in Chrome, since their value would be significantly reduced - the ban on Symantec EV certificates will last for at least one year. All replacement certificates issued by Symantec to customers will need to have a validity period of nine months or less in order to be trusted in Chrome. This is likely to cause further problems for some large companies, which won't be able to easily replace their certificates every nine months. It's safe to say that Google's sanctions might have a significant impact on Symantec's SSL business, as the company is likely to lose customers who won't be willing to put up with these restrictions and will take their business to a different certificate authority (CA). Browser vendors have punished CAs before for improperly issuing certificates -- or "misissuing" them, in industry parlance -- but never on this scale and with an impact so large on the ecosystem. Read more ​Citrix may be selling, but is Microsoft buying? Some people have always wondered if browser vendors can really take drastic sanctions against the world's largest CAs, or whether those authorities are simply too big to fail. The reason for this unprecedented punishment seems to be repeated incidents of misissued certificates at Symantec that have come to light over the past few years, some of which the company failed to identify on its own despite internal and external audits. The latest case was uncovered this year and involved 127 certificates issued with bogus information or without proper domain ownership verification by a Symantec partner that operated as a registration authority (RA). According to Google, that investigation calls into question the validity of at least 30,000 certificates issued by Symantec partners over a period spanning several years. However, Symantec disputes that number. Read more ​Exeed partners with vGRID to offer channel cloud services "Symantec allowed at least four parties access to their infrastructure in a way to cause certificate issuance, did not sufficiently oversee these capabilities as required and expected, and when presented with evidence of these organizations’ failure to abide to the appropriate standard of care, failed to disclose such information in a timely manner or to identify the significance of the issues reported to them," Google's Ryan Sleevi said in a post on the Chrome development mailing list. This and past incidents have led Google to "no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years," Sleevi said. Symantec strongly objected to Google's plan and criticized its publication. It also described Google's remarks about the company's past misissuances as "exaggerated and misleading." "This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible," the company said in a blog post Friday. "We hope it was not calculated to create uncertainty and doubt within the Internet community about our SSL/TLS certificates." Read more ​How Kiwi partners can maximise Microsoft Teams The claim about the 30,000 certficates is not true and the 127 certificates that have been confirmed as misissued did not result in any consumer harm, Symantec said, adding that the relationship with the partner responsible for the incident has been terminated and that its entire RA program has been discontinued. "While all major CAs have experienced SSL/TLS certificate mis-issuance events, Google has singled out the Symantec Certificate Authority in its proposal even though the mis-issuance event identified in Google’s blog post involved several CAs," Symantec said. The company will work to minimise any potential disruption caused by Google's proposal if it goes forward, but is open to discussing the matter with Google and finding a mutually agreed-on solution. Meanwhile, Mozilla, which manages its own root certificate program, is also considering sanctions for Symantec and might have to align them with Google's. "Now that Google have announced their action, it is unavoidable to note that it can be preferable for two root stores considering action against a CA to take broadly parallel approaches, so that the CA is not doubly penalised for the same actions," Mozilla's Gervase Markham wrote on the organisation's security policy mailing list. However, Markham noted that Google's plan is "at the strong end" of the options he was considering and that calibrating the level of response, which has to take into account previous precedents and sanctions against other CAs, is a difficult process.

The latest case was uncovered this year and involved 127 certificates issued with bogus information or without proper domain ownership verification by a Symantec partner that operated as a registration authority (RA). According to Google, that investigation calls into question the validity of at least 30,000 certificates issued by Symantec partners over a period spanning several years. However, Symantec disputes that number. Read more ​Exeed partners with vGRID to offer channel cloud services "Symantec allowed at least four parties access to their infrastructure in a way to cause certificate issuance, did not sufficiently oversee these capabilities as required and expected, and when presented with evidence of these organizations’ failure to abide to the appropriate standard of care, failed to disclose such information in a timely manner or to identify the significance of the issues reported to them," Google's Ryan Sleevi said in a post on the Chrome development mailing list. This and past incidents have led Google to "no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years," Sleevi said. Symantec strongly objected to Google's plan and criticized its publication. It also described Google's remarks about the company's past misissuances as "exaggerated and misleading." "This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible," the company said in a blog post Friday. "We hope it was not calculated to create uncertainty and doubt within the Internet community about our SSL/TLS certificates." Read more ​How Kiwi partners can maximise Microsoft Teams The claim about the 30,000 certficates is not true and the 127 certificates that have been confirmed as misissued did not result in any consumer harm, Symantec said, adding that the relationship with the partner responsible for the incident has been terminated and that its entire RA program has been discontinued. "While all major CAs have experienced SSL/TLS certificate mis-issuance events, Google has singled out the Symantec Certificate Authority in its proposal even though the mis-issuance event identified in Google’s blog post involved several CAs," Symantec said. The company will work to minimise any potential disruption caused by Google's proposal if it goes forward, but is open to discussing the matter with Google and finding a mutually agreed-on solution. Meanwhile, Mozilla, which manages its own root certificate program, is also considering sanctions for Symantec and might have to align them with Google's. "Now that Google have announced their action, it is unavoidable to note that it can be preferable for two root stores considering action against a CA to take broadly parallel approaches, so that the CA is not doubly penalised for the same actions," Mozilla's Gervase Markham wrote on the organisation's security policy mailing list. However, Markham noted that Google's plan is "at the strong end" of the options he was considering and that calibrating the level of response, which has to take into account previous precedents and sanctions against other CAs, is a difficult process.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Android O: All the new features in Google’s next major update Chris Smith @chris_writes March 22nd, 2017 at 2:20 PM Share Tweet Google on Tuesday came out with the first developer preview of Android O, its next major Android update. You can already install it on supported devices including last year’s Google Pixel phones, and we’ve already shown you the most important new features of the upcoming mobile OS upgrade. However, there are various other features baked into Android O that fans will want to know about, including behind-the-scenes improvements and plenty of user-facing tweaks. Don't Miss: New leaked photos show us just how incredible Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design is Android O might seem like a boring update at first, since it doesn’t have any major features yet that might come anywhere close to being game-changers. However, that wouldn’t be a correct assessment of Google’s next Android upgrade. The company is taking several steps to offer an improved Android experience, whether that means extending battery life, offering more granular control over notifications, or overhauling the Settings app. We’ve already looked at some of the best features in Android O — better battery life and performance, higher-quality audio, revamped notifications, picture-in-picture videos, and keyboard support — but that barely scratches the surface. In fact, it’s also likely that Google has kept some things secret and will unveil more features at its upcoming Google I/O event in May. In the meantime, there are plenty of new Android O features you should be interested in, such as: A new Settings app that’s been rebuilt from the ground up to offer a better way to manage the phone Autofill APIs that let you quickly fill in saved passwords from passwords manager apps Adaptive icons that should bring a more cohesive look to Android across devices regardless of an OEM’s customizations Wide-gamut color support that will improve graphics on high-end devices Wi-Fi Aware for direct Wi-Fi transfers of content without the need for an Internet connection WebView improvements that should enhance security in apps that offer web browsing features The following videos from 9to5Google, Android Central, and Droid-Life will show you what Android O looks like right now, and explain how some of the features listed above work. Android O will be released in the third quarter of the year, so there’s plenty of waiting in store. If you want more information about Android O, check out the full change log at this link.

Follow The Post’s tech blog, The Switch, where technology and policy connect. As the owner of a small business in liberal Massachusetts, John Ellis was a natural sympathizer of the nationwide call for advertisers to boycott Breitbart News, with its hard-edge conservative politics and close ties to President Trump. But it made Ellis wonder about other, more extreme right-wing sites: Who is placing ads on them? A few clicks around the Internet revealed a troubling answer: He was. On a website owned by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer, Ellis saw an ad for his engineering company, Optics for Hire, pop up on the screen — even though he had never knowingly bought the ad. What Ellis had stumbled on was a little-known facet of the booming world of Internet advertising. Businesses using the latest in online advertising technology offered by Google, Yahoo and major competitors are also increasingly finding their ads placed alongside politically extreme and derogatory content. That’s because the ad networks offered by Google, Yahoo and others can display ads on vast numbers of third-party websites based on people’s search and browsing histories. Although the strategy gives advertisers an unprecedented ability to reach customers who fit a narrow profile, it dramatically curtails their ability to control where their advertisements appear. “No one has any idea where their ads are going,” said Ellis. In some cases, he added, ad networks “are monetizing hate.” In a sign of growing frustration, AT&T, Verizon and other leading companies this week pulled their business from Google’s AdSense network in response to news reports that ads had appeared with propaganda from the Islamic State and violent groups. But the issue is broader. A Washington Post examination of dozens of sites with politically extreme and derogatory content found that many were customers of leading ad networks, which share a portion of revenue gleaned from advertisers with the site’s operators. The Post’s examination found that the networks had displayed ads for Allstate, IBM, DirectTV and dozens of other household brand names on websites with content containing racial and ethnic slurs, Holocaust denial and disparaging comments about African Americans, Jews, women and gay people. Some of these sites, the Post found, featured hateful and derogatory content throughout. In others, it was confined to comment sections, where users went far beyond the language used by the sites’ writers, whose expressed views fell closer to the political mainstream. Google’s AdSense, for example, last month ran ads for several companies alongside comments using a slur for African Americans, saying “hang them all.” Other Google-displayed ads, for Macy’s and the genetics company 23andMe, appeared on the website My Posting Career, which describes itself as a “white privilege zone,” next to a notice saying the site would offer a referral bonus for each member related to Adolf Hitler. “No business wants to be associated with sites like that,” said Andy Kill, spokesman for genetic testing company 23andMe. “If you’re trusting an ad algorithm to do this, this is what can happen,” he said. “It’s frustrating.” My Posting Career did not reply to an email seeking comment. The problem has emerged as Web advertising strategies have evolved. Advertisers sometimes choose to place their ads on particular sites — or avoid sites they dislike — but a growing share of advertising budgets go to what the industry calls “programmatic” buys. These ads are aimed at people whose demographic or consumer profile is receptive to a marketing message, no matter where they browse on the Internet. Algorithms decide where to place ads, based on people’s prior Web usage, across vastly different types of sites. The technology companies behind ad networks have slowly begun to address the issue, but warn it won’t be easy to solve. They say their algorithms struggle to distinguish between content that is truly offensive and language that is not offensive in context. For example, it can be hard for computers to determine the difference between the use of a racial slur on a white-supremacy site and a website about history. The tech companies have also long been reluctant to put themselves in the position of an arbiter of speech — given the subjectivity involved and the legal risk of making decisions about what content deserves to be read or not. It’s a situation that tech giants are increasingly encountering in related spheres, too, with the proliferation of false and highly politicized news sites spreading misinformation on social networks. On Monday, following inquiries from The Post and requests from advertisers who also had been contacted by The Post, Google apologized to advertisers. It announced it would be conducting an “extensive review” of ad policies with the goal of taking a tougher stance on “hateful, offensive, and derogatory content.” Google said such comments violate its hate-speech policies but would not say whether it had taken action against the sites. The company said it reviews thousands of sites each day for violations and booted more than 100,000 publishers — including many single-author publishers — from its AdSense network in 2016. Yahoo, which blocked one site that was the subject of a query by The Post, said it condemns racist or other hateful speech, adding, “Of the billions of ads served on a daily basis, there are rare instances when automated ad platforms serve ads in places they shouldn’t.” (The Washington Post sometimes uses such networks to place ads touting its offerings, such as subscriptions, and also generates revenue featuring ads sold through advertising networks.) Many of the companies contacted for this story — including IBM, bareMinerals, Macy’s, Everquote and Allstate — expressed surprise and dismay that their ads appeared near derogatory content. Several said they had requested that networks blacklist those pages, which is easy to do for individual sites but not for entire categories of sites. Automated filters typically miss certain kinds of derogatory speech, and tech companies traditionally have not hired the massive number of people necessary to carefully monitor content on billions of Web pages. Some advertisers also expressed frustration that ad networks had failed to keep marketing messages from appearing alongside reader comments that might upset customers — even on sites that themselves do not promote extremist content. Google’s AdSense, for example, displayed an ad for cosmetics company bareMinerals in the comments section of Weaselzippers.us, an aggregator of conservative news. A user comment on the site used a derogatory word for gay men and said they should be “lying in a pool of blood.” When The Post emailed an image of the Web page to bareMinerals spokeswoman Joanne Chiu Sulit, she said, “I was shocked that we were on that site.” An email to the operators of Weaselzippers.us was not returned. ‘It’s whack-a-mole’ The issue of ad placements has become charged in an era of rising political polarization. The number of right-wing hate sites, as well as sites that traffic in sensationalist news and hoaxes, has doubled over the past year, according to ad auditing firm DoubleVerify. With so many new sites, it’s difficult for advertisers to avoid having their ads appear in unwelcome places. “It’s whack-a-mole,” said Wayne Gattinella, chief executive of DoubleVerify. “You can flag keywords. You can use algorithmic decision-making to minimize it, but there is no way to filter the word choice in real time.” Advertisers generally have little choice but to depend on ad networks. The major ones have policies prohibiting advertising on sites featuring discriminatory or hateful speech, but The Post found dozens of apparent violations. Many of the sites where The Post found violations are considered hate sites by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an advocacy group that tracks hate speech. “[Ad networks] have rules in place but they don’t enforce them,” said Jillian York, an advocate with the Electronic Freedom Foundation, which runs Online Censorship, a program pushing technology companies to clarify why they remove content. Last month, an ad for insurance company Allstate appeared on Alternative-Right.BlogSpot.com, whose comments section praised “Hitler and his National Socialists as a visionary.” Allstate said it has tried to avoid such sites through filters. “Allstate does not knowingly advertise on media that provokes hate or includes threatening, discriminatory or offensive language,” spokeswoman Laura Strykowski said. Everquote and DirectTV ads appeared on Spencer’s site, RadixJournal.com, alongside comments decrying the Catholic Church for advocating racial mixing and deluging white, Christian countries with “savages of the worst kind.” DirectTV declined to comment. Everquote said that although it uses ad networks, “We specifically require that these advertising networks refrain from placing our ads on any sites containing and/or relating to, among other things, violence, sex, racism, sexism, pornography, illegal or potentially illegal subject matter, negative publicity or any other highly explosive subject matter.” Ads for Macy’s, Amazon.com, and even Planned Parenthood, appeared on the racially inflammatory website My Posting Career. Ads to shop on Amazon.com appeared on a site with an article headlined “Yes, I am a Nazi,” and a comments sections peppered with profanity and racial slurs. Amazon, which also runs an ad network, declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post). ‘Crisis of our time’ Silicon Valley companies long have resisted calls to more aggressively police content on their platforms, saying a free and open Internet is the underpinning of the Web itself. With the exception of child pornography, Congress largely has agreed with the Silicon Valley viewpoint, leaving tech companies substantial legal leeway to monitor — or not — the content that appears on the sites and platforms that they operate. But advertisers are demanding changes. “[Tech companies] are struggling to adjust to a reality where the same tools that enabled them to connect the world are now being used to drive it apart,” entrepreneur and venture capitalist Noah Lichtenstein said. “This is the crisis of our time: How do you balance the desire to have the Web be open and connected with a rising tide of institutionalized hate and the protection of those who are being attacked?” It’s not clear how effective the push to deprive such sites of advertising will be. Spencer said targeting Radix Journal and similar sites is unfair to advertisers because they have so little control over where their ads appear. And if the goal is to deprive extreme sites of money, he predicted the effort would have little effect because the revenue from Web ads is so small, totaling at most a few thousand dollars a year. “If I were kicked off of all of these things, it would have no effect on my life whatsoever,” Spencer said. Emails to contact information listed for Alternative-Right.blogspot.com received no reply. Breitbart News also did not return emails seeking comment about the advertising boycott directed against the site. Disqus, a Silicon Valley start-up that manages comments sections for 4 million sites, including those for Breitbart News, Radix Journal and Occidental Dissent, sells advertising alongside the comments. It has been trying to work through the issues raised by inflammatory content, said chief executive Daniel Ha, adding that the company has been flooded with complaints about hate speech from users, advertisers and employees. “User-generated content has always been extremely chaotic, and that’s part of what makes the Internet so amazing — you can share very unpopular ideas,” Ha said. “I think, however, that we’ve seen in the last year that there’s a bigger responsibility for how that affects society.” The company’s terms and conditions prohibit instances of “extreme discrimination” on its comment boards, and a team of 10 reviewers makes the judgment calls. He said the line between “targeted harassment that feels violent” vs. someone making an off-color joke isn’t always clear. In a blog post last month, the company announced a new tool that allows users to flag offensive comments. But the software is still largely untested. Ha said he had blocked three of the extremist sites after being contacted by The Post. One of them, the neo-Confederate site Occidental Dissent, used the development to make a public call for more donations, earning what site founder Brad Griffin said was about $1,000 — several times more than the advertisements had produced in recent months. “It worked out nice for me,” Griffin said.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Google releases Chrome OS 57 stable with some tablet-friendly features 03/24/2017 at 2:28 PM by Brad Linder 5 Comments There are a growing number of Chromebooks with convertible tablet-style designs. So it makes sense that over the past few years Google has added some touchscreen-friendly features to Chrome OS, like an on-screen keyboard for typing without touching a physical keyboard. Now Google is rolling out the stable version of Chrome OS 57, and it includes a few more tablet-friendly features… although not all tablet-style Chromebooks are getting the update right away. Among other things, Chrome OS changes what happens when you press the power button. Previously, pressing the power button would lock the device and show the lock screen. Now it puts a Chromebook to sleep. That might seem like a small change, but it’s an important one: if you’re using a Chromebook in laptop mode you can put it to sleep by closing the lid. But if you’re holding a tablet that might not be an option. Right now most tablet-style Chromebooks feature built-in keyboards that fold back behind the screen when they’re not in use. But this paves the way for Chromebooks with detachable keyboards or Chrome OS tablets with no keyboards at all. For now, it’s nice to know that you can keep a convertible Chromebook in tablet mode without flipping the screen just to put the device to sleep. Another tablet-friendly feature is an updated Camera app feature that adjusts the UI depending on whether you’re using a front or rear camera. Not only is this useful for tablets or other devices with dual cameras, but it can also be used on some of the education-oriented Chromebooks that have a single camera that can tilt to face the keyboard side of a laptop, or face away. Other changes include support for PIN unlock on all Chromebooks, an updated boot animation and updated default wallpaper, and support for silent authentication. While some of the most useful updates in Chrome 57 apply to convertible tablet-style devices, it’s interesting to note that a handful of Chromebooks won’t receive the over-the-air update just yet, and those models include convertible models such as the Asus Chromebook Flip C100PA, Asus Chromebook Flip C302, Acer Chromebook R13, and Samsung Chromebook Plus.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Tuesday, March 28, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 15337 79 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

Digital Trends Home > Wearables > Movado’s Connect smartwatches start at $495… Movado’s Connect smartwatches start at $495, ship with Android Wear 2.0 By Julian Chokkattu — March 24, 2017 1:26 PM Subscribe Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you 2017 is bringing a lot of options for Android Wear enthusiasts. Movado is the latest watchmaker to partner with Google. While we already know Swarovski will announce an Android Wear smartwatch “for her” at Baselworld 2017, Movado just announced a slew of other devices at the annual watch and jewelry trade show. These devices won’t launch until the fall 2017. Qualcomm hinted early this year that more and more Android Wear smartwatches are on the way, and what better place for them to be unveiled than at one of the largest watch trade shows in the world? Movado’s Android Wear lineup has been designed for version 2.0 of Google’s smartwatch operating system, which launched on the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style in February. The new version is expected to roll out to a handful of current smartwatches over the coming months. More: LG Watch Sport (Android Wear 2.0) review Movado Connect is the name of the watchmaker’s Android Wear 2.0 lineup of smartwatches, and there will be five men’s styles “with a starting price of $495.” These smartwatches will be available in the United States, the Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company said smartwatches under the Movado Connect brand will feature “five unique customizable dials” that will each also have three to four customizable elements — such as backgrounds, watch hands, and complications. Complications are like widgets that sit on the watch face, offering a shortcut and a brief glance into specific apps, such as your calendar or fitness activity. It seems as though Movado will offer further customization of these dials than what’s currently possible on other Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches. More: Swarovski partnering with Qualcomm, Google on an Android Wear smartwatch They will all likely feature NFC, as Movado specifically mentions Android Pay compatiblity. Google Assistant, which was introduced in Wear 2.0, will also be present. The watchmaker said the devices will have an always-on display, round screens, improved fitness tracking (which is likely the Google Fit improvements introduced in Wear 2.0), and iOS and Android compatibility. Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss are also two brands in the Movado Group that are also partnering will Google to introduce new devices in the fall of 2017, though nothing specific was mentioned.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google retires SMS support in Hangouts, axes… Google retires SMS support in Hangouts, axes experimental Gmail features By Kyle Wiggers — March 24, 2017 1:38 PM Subscribe Share TopRank Marketing / Flickr Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you use Hangouts to send and receive SMS messages, it's time to switch: Google is doing away with support soon. At the Google’s HQ in San Francisco, it’s that time of year again: Spring cleaning. On Friday, Google detailed features that will be going away in the coming weeks as part of the company’s perennial efforts toward “streamlining” its products. First to get the ax is text message support in Google’s Hangouts messaging app. In the next few weeks, holdouts will get a Hangouts notification to switch to another app. And starting on May 22, Hangouts will cease to send and receive carrier SMS messages. More: Attack on Slack: Google beefs up its Hangouts services, meet and chat Google is suggesting that users migrate to its text-focused Android Messages app. “We want to provide a consistent and easy-to-use SMS experience for Android users right out of the box,” a spokesperson said. “We’re focusing on making Android Messages the primary place to access SMS and are working with carriers and device manufacturers to include Android Messages natively in Android devices.” Google notes that the shutdown won’t impact Google Voice users and Google Fi subscribers who use Hangouts for messaging. It has published a helpful resource with more information. Meanwhile, Google Talk — the precursor to Hangouts — is shutting down entirely. Google said it will prompt Gmail users who haven’t switched to Hangouts to do so, and that the legacy Google Talk Android app, which Google replaced with Hangouts in 2013, will stop functioning by late April. More: Hangouts may lose SMS support as Google overhauls it to take on Slack Google is also retiring a few features in Labs, mail service’s experimental collection of apps and settings. Authentication Icons, which identified verified (i.e., legitimate) senders with a “key” icon, are going the way of the dodo. So will the Google Voice Player, which provided an audio preview of incoming voice mails. The next to go are previews of Picasa photos and chat pictures; Quick Links, which provided fast access to emails and folders; the ability to quote selected text;  Smart Labels, which automatically categorized newsletters, promotions, receipts, and notifications; and Yelp review snippets. Finally, Google is retiring Google+ functionality in Gmail. Beginning sometime in April, you’ll no longer be able to email Google+ profiles or use Google+ Circles. More: Google launches business-friendly video-calling version of Hangouts called Meet Canning old products and features — even popular ones — is nothing new for Google. In 2013, the Mountain View giant caused a minor uproar when it shut down Google Reader, an web service that consolidated articles from around the web. And it shut down Google Flu Vaccine Finder, a mapping app that showed nearby vaccination places across the United States, in 2012. Still, the shutdowns will no doubt catch some users by surprise, but Google is pledging to minimize the disruption wherever possible. “We realize these updates may be an inconvenience,” a spokesperson said. “These updates will help us to focus and prioritize features that will improve the entire G Suite user experience for everyone.”
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google is reportedly working on a new social app… Google is reportedly working on a new social app for photo editing and sharing By Christian de Looper — March 24, 2017 4:14 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Google's apps are a little hit-and-miss -- but if it's good, the next big photo app could allow you to share and edit photos with your friends. Google is working on yet another app. One of the company’s most-loved apps is Google Photos and it offers excellent options for photo editing, storing, and sharing — but it looks like Photos isn’t the only photo-based app Google is concerned with. Reports indicate that the company working on another app, this time specifically for photo editing and sharing. Why? Well, it could be because of the pressure posed by the other large tech companies. Facebook, for example, offers Moments — and Google’s new app could be similar. The news comes from a TechCrunch report, which notes that the app allows groups to edit photos together, then organize them. More: Google announces updates for Duo, Allo, Photos, and Google Search in Brazil In another report, from Engadget, a Google spokesperson noted that the new app is just an experiment — so it’s possible it may not even see the light of day. In fact, Google doesn’t currently have launch plans, although that could, of course, change. It’s important to note that reports indicate this won’t just be “another messaging app.” Rather, it will be aimed at collaborative photo editing — along with a splash of Google’s computer expertise. Reports also note that the new app sounds very similar to Paths, an app that gained popularity for offering small groups of friends to share photos and chat. At the time, it acted kind of like a counterbalance to the more open sharing that had gained popularity on Facebook and Twitter. Incidentally, Google previously tried to buy Path. In the end, however, it was sold to Kakao, a Korean messaging giant, and its popularity has slowly but surely shrunk. It will be interesting to see what Google’s new app ends up looking like if we ever see it at all. Google has a spotty history in social media, after all. It’s also possible that the features in the new app will end up being baked into Google Photos. We’ll just have to wait and see.

External Links | 17 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (2) Google Home Caught Sneaking Ads into Responses by Josh Centers File this one under the “That’s just wrong” category. Google Home, the search giant’s smart speaker, has been caught slipping ads for the new “Beauty and the Beast” movie into its virtual assistant responses. On Twitter, user Bryson Meunier posted a video showing Google Home promoting the movie when he asked what his day was going to be like.

Release of Samsung Galaxy S8: Will Samsung make it a game changer? Sun, 2017-03-26 11:37  editor United Kingdom Hemantha Abeywardena writes from London… After a flurry of rumours, leaks and guesses that have been running for months, Samsung Galaxy S8 is going to be released on Wednesday, according to Samsung, the tech giant, while stirring up the excitement of millions of its fans, most, if not all, may have had a bruising experience last year, if they bought the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 Samsung suffered a double whammy of the arrest of its Group Chief, Jay Y Lee, having been under the spotlight for months over a corruption scandal and the exploding Galaxy Note 7 disaster last year. It lost billions of dollars due to the latter, which left a significant dent on its global reputation; the poor PR handling made things worse for Samsung, when the problem could have been nipped in the bud with an honest admission and timely product recall. In this context, Samsung may have used all the resources at its disposal to get this big event right for obvious reasons. Since all major phone manufactures are focussing on improving the usual features such as the screen resolution, display size of the phone, the features of the phone and the size of memory, Samsung may introduce something unique in order to stay way ahead of the pack. The speculation was rife that Samsung may introduce a versatile AI – artificial intelligence – assistant to rival the existing ones – Apple’s Siri, Google’s OK Google and Windows Cortana. Samsung confirmed that it was the case recently by naming the AI assistant, Bixby; whether Bixby is going to outsmart its peers, remains to be seen, though. Samsung phones became a serious rival to Apple’s iPhone while using Google’s Android operating system. Since over 80% of global mobile phones are using Android phones, the place of Samsung among the very users is secure despite the Note 7 debacle. Things, however, changed last year. With the sleek, eye-catching designs and cutting-edge technologies to match them, Samsung has been winning the hearts and minds of Android phone users for years. During the Note 7 calamity, most users opted for Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, when they needed a new phone, in spite of a looming uncertainty over the next smartphone by Samsung. When my iPhone 6 stopped functioning, I turned to Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, while bringing my loyalty to Apple to an abrupt end. The combination of its gorgeous appearance with curved display and amazing camera doesn’t let me contemplate on an alternative at present. If Galaxy S8 goes beyond the usual, evolutionary changes, millions of users in my position will be attracted to the new product in the offing. Samsung made a monumental mistake by expediting the launch of Note 7, perhaps, to take on Apple iPhone 7, when Apple’s flagship product saw its sales falling for two successive quarters. It didn’t work; nor did it hurt Apple. This time around, Samsung appeared to have learned the lesson; there is no rush on Samsung’s part to release the new phone. It took time, may have done the homework properly and placed the necessary mechanism in place not to make the same blunder this year again. If Samsung comes up with a revolutionary change, mobile phone users will forgive the company for the infamous mistake and start flocking towards the star product in no time. - Asian Tribune - Tweet Login or register to post comments News Headlines SDGs should not be the icing on business-as-usual 'cake' People Demand Sampanthan’s Resignation The TULF deman Hong Kong elects China-backed first female leader Carrie Lam as chief executive!

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 26 March 2017 | MYT 12:00 PM Iranian immigrant rose to building Google’s business, leading Twitter’s board Success story: Kordestani at the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco. The Iranian-born businessman grew up in San Jose, California, and was Google's chief business officer before moving to Twitter in 2015. — Bay Area News Group/TNS SAN FRANCISCO: Follow someone you know. That's how Twitter executive chairman Omid Kordestani, like many immigrants, found his way from Iran to Silicon Valley as a teenager.  The move was unexpected. So was his father's death from cancer, a moment of grief that left his family with a decision about where to go next. And as luck would have it, Kordestani followed family friends to the United States in the 1970s just as turmoil broke out in Iran.  "My immigration was total serendipity," he said in an interview at Twitter's San Francisco headquarters.  Kordestani's trials as an immigrant and his success in Silicon Valley help illustrate why the tech industry has reacted so strongly to President Donald Trump's travel ban. Immigrants in the Bay Area have founded companies, served as executives and helped create the technology of the future.  An immigrant's journey to a new country is rarely as simple as following a relative or friend. But Kordestani's challenges also shaped his success in Silicon Valley, including more than a decade at Google, where he joined the tech firm as employee number 11 and led the company's global business operations.  He once told a graduating class at San Jose State University – his alma mater – to "think and act like an immigrant."  "What I mean by that immigrant attitude is that you've got to continually fight, challenge yourself," said Kordestani, who is now a US citizen. "You've got to make yourself uncomfortable so you grow from that."  At 53 years old, he's still tackling new challenges at Twitter, a tech firm that raked in US$2.5bil (RM11.06bil) in revenue in 2016, but posted a loss of US$457mil (RM2.02bil). Trump's tweeting has raised Twitter's profile around the world, yet the company still struggles to compete for ad dollars amid layoffs and executive departures.  Trump's recently revised executive order, though blocked in court, continues to bring more attention to how immigration fuelled Silicon Valley's growth. It's also placed more pressure on Twitter's leaders, who have faced calls from critics to bar the president from the social network for what they deem as hate speech and misinformation.  While Kordestani opposes the travel ban, he's also an optimist who firmly believes in the power of dialogue that Twitter enables.  "Achieving the success he has achieved has allowed him to have a very optimistic view of the world – that hard work and persistence will pay off in the end – and he brings that to every meeting and challenge," said Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's general counsel.  When Kordestani reflects on his childhood in Tehran, Iran, he describes a metropolis filled with different cultures and religions living together in harmony.  His mom was a nurse. His dad, an engineer, built a three-story apartment that the middle-class family called home. Americans lived on one floor. Israelis lived on another. His dance instructor was Armenian.  Attending Andisheh Don Bosco School, an Italian Catholic school in Tehran, Kordestani studied in English and Farsi.  But when his father died, Kordestani knew there would be more opportunities to study engineering outside of Iran. Getting admitted into a university in Iran is highly competitive, and there are only a limited number of spots for students.  At 14 years old, Kordestani envisioned life in America would be like the sitcom The Jeffersons. The country was filled with opportunity, as conveyed by the show's Movin' On Up theme song.  "It was an African-American family living in Manhattan," Kordestani said. "It just seemed like this incredible dazzling city to me, and I imagined the entire United States looked like that."  Two choices were on the table: San Jose, where his father's boss had sons attending school, or Fort Worth, Texas.  "I think California has better weather. We should go there," his mom said at the time.  In 1978, Kordestani, his younger brother and mom packed their bags for San Jose. The harmonious Iran of his youth soon became a distant memory.  After graduating from San Jose State University in 1984 with a degree in electrical and electronics engineering, Kordestani took a job at Hewlett-Packard as a product marketing manager.  Around that time, he also became a naturalised US citizen. That allowed him to bring back his mom, who had left the country because she didn't have a green card.  After five years at HP, Kordestani wanted another challenge, so he earned a master's degree in business administration from Stanford University and went on to work for a number of Silicon Valley startups.  He joined Google in 1999, and employees who worked with him said he instilled confidence during the company's rapid growth.  Colleagues joked that Kordestani was "sandbagging," or tempering expectations to make Google's financial results look better. So he once stood on a sandbag to read quarterly forecasts and targets.  "It shows his ability to laugh at himself and his ability to create strong cultures that really set the company up for success," said Jeff Levick, who had served as Google's vice president of industry development and marketing for the Americas region. Levick is now an executive in residence at Greylock Partners.  But at the peak of Kordestani's career success, fame and fortune at Google, he also found himself in the office of a psychologist in San Francisco, going through a divorce with his wife Bita Daryabari and questioning if he should be happy with all he accomplished.  In 2008, Forbes valued Kordestani's net worth at US$2.2bil (RM9.73bil). After his divorce, Forbes assessed his net worth in 2009 at US$1.4bil (RM6.19bil).  Speaking in 2009 at a leadership conference at UCLA, organised by two Iranian-American groups, Kordestani said that "life is messy," but urged the audience not to be afraid of failure. When life surprises you, he told the crowd, checklists and the Persian life manual go out the window.  In 2011, Kordestani, who has two older children with Daryabari, got married again. His current wife, Gisel, used to work at Google and is the co-founder and chief operating officer of political fundraising site Crowdpac.  "Sometimes you think people like Omid are perfect and untouchable. He showed the real human side of struggle and shared it, and I think that was valiant," Gisel Kordestani said of the speech her husband gave in 2009.  He has two young children with Gisel, who was born and raised in France but has English parents. The couple speak French, English and Farsi to their children.  Kordestani has a contagious laugh, like several of his colleagues and friends whom he's known for 30 or 40 years, his wife said.  "I make fun of him because when he's telling a joke, he usually starts laughing as he's telling the punch line," she said.  On an alumni wall of honour filled with black and gold plaques at San Jose State University, an etching of a smiling Kordestani stands out among other notable engineering graduates.  When students pack that room to receive scholarships, Belle Wei, an SJSU professor and former dean of the college of engineering, often points to Kordestani's plaque as she encourages them to follow their own dreams.  "If you work hard, you're in the right place and doing the right thing," she tells the students, "then one day you can be like Omid." — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Pre-orders for Sony Xperia XZs and XA1 start today Chinese court rules in favour of Apple in local design patent disputes Intel tries to fire up high-end PC demand with new memory chips Digi spearheads digital learning trend among employees Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.30am EDT 02:30 Lap 56 - It’s 10.5 seconds for Vettel. Now Verstappen is asking his garage what the fastest lap is so he can have a go, and they sensibly reply “too fast”. At the same time Bottas, then Raikkonen nab the new fastest lap. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.28am EDT 02:28 Lap 55 - Looks like our top five is set now. 1) Vettel 2) Hamilton 3) Bottas 4) Raikkonen 5) Verstappen With Massa the only other man on the lead lap. Meanwhile Kvyat has been asked to nurse the car through to the end, and responded by asking who now had the fastest lap and what it was. That’s the sort of devil may care attitude the new owners of F1 will love. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.27am EDT 02:27 Lap 54 - Verstappen can still see Raikkonen in front of him, going around roughly 1.3 seconds behind him for the entire lap. He’s probably too far away now, losing time in the early turns of the next lap. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.26am EDT 02:26 Lap 53 - Vettel puts an exclamation mark on his day by nicking the fastest lap from Kvyat immediately.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.25am EDT 02:25 Lap 52 - It’s all red at the front, with Vettel merrily going about his business with a comfortable lead. Doesn’t look like much chance of a Bottas attack on Hamilton now. Kvyat has just set the fastest lap of the race. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.23am EDT 02:23 Lap 51 - The battle for the last point has become a three-way fight, with Alonso in front of Ocon and now with Hulkenberg preying on them as well. Ocon goes in front! Hulkenberg nicks past Alonso as well. Confirmed suspension failure for Magnussen. Roll the ‘Haas of Pain’ headlines. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.22am EDT 02:22 Lap 50 - Kevin Magnussen retires, and surprisingly Kvyat comes into the pits. He had the last scheduled stop, and now what we expect is the last unscheduled one. The gap at the front is 8.4, and a further 1.9 from Hamilton to Bottas. The top six are all on the first lap, ending with Massa. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.20am EDT 02:20 Lap 49 - It might not be all over for the Hamilton vs Bottas contest yet.

The new Nokia and BlackBerry phones shown at Mobile World Congress rely heavily on nostalgia and are aimed at niche markets; will that be enough to pull customers away from Apple, Samsung and the other big makers? PUBLISHED : Sunday, 26 March, 2017, 8:32am UPDATED : Sunday, 26 March, 2017, 8:32am Comments:   Ben Sin ben.sin@scmp.com Share PrintEmail Related topics Nokia Smartphones BlackBerry Related Articles Lifestyle Promise of 5G future dominates Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 4 Mar 2017 Tech New Nokia 6 unlikely to be a hit in China 12 Jan 2017 Apps & Gaming Nokia invests in women’s menstrual cycle tracking app 30 Nov 2016 It’s hard to imagine now, with the Apple iPhone and the array of Samsung models around the globe, that there once was a time when Nokia and BlackBerry were kings of the mobile phone industry. Finnish company Nokia made some of the first mobile phones in the 1980s, helped these devices become household items in the early 2000s, and by 2007, had a whopping 41 per cent of the mobile handset market. Meanwhile, BlackBerry, the brainchild of Canadian company Research in Motion, dominated the enterprise market, becoming a status symbol among working professionals. At its peak in 2009, it made an annual profit of US$2 billion and had a 20 per cent market share. We all know what happened next. Neither company took the iPhone, with its iOS platform, seriously when it was introduced in 2007, and within five years their kingdoms had fallen to the iPhone and phones using Google’s Android. The indestructible Nokia 3310 is back, complete with Snake, retro styling and epic battery life By the time Nokia and BlackBerry stopped making phones, in 2014 and 2016 respectively (the former was first sold to Microsoft and later passed to Finnish start-up HMD Global, while BlackBerry became the property of Chinese company TCL), the brands had been irrelevant for so long, no one but the most hardcore of mobile geeks cared – and even that was out of pure nostalgia. And so, when new BlackBerry and Nokia handsets were announced at this year’s Mobile World Congress, neither fans of the brands nor the media were sure what to expect. After all, both brands crashed and burned badly due to their repeated inability to understand mobile trends in the early 2010s, and the industry has only become more competitive since then, so can they make a real splash? Not at the highest level, no. No one can objectively say the five new handsets (four Nokias and one from BlackBerry) introduced at the Mobile World Congress are going to do much damage to Samsung and Apple phone sales – not with their modest specs and solid but unspectacular hardware – but all five phones do have specific features that cater to niche audiences. Plus, nostalgia is a powerful emotion, and both brands are designed to conjure up plenty of that among fans. BlackBerry’s KEYOne, for example, is a clear continuation of the once mighty portable work machines, a mostly black aluminium device with a physical keyboard attached to a modest 4.5-inch 1080P display. The problem is that few consumers today are clamouring for a physical keyboard, and the KEYone also runs on an underpowered Snapdragon 625 processor – a far cry from the Snapdragon 835 that will feature in Samsung’s Galaxy S8. TCL’s chief executive officer, Nicolas Zibell, says in defence: “We must stop thinking of the smartphone user experience as being driven by chipset power alone. In the same way that automobile makers select a certain engine to be optimised for an overall experience in a vehicle, the processor in a smartphone must be taken into context with the overall design and user value proposition.” HMD Global, meanwhile, introduced three new Nokia-branded devices running pure stock Android (which is usually only available on Google’s own line of phones, since brands such as Samsung and Huawei put their own software on top of Android), and a fourth device that drew most of the attention: an “updated” version of the iconic Nokia 3310. “Nokia has much brand equity and emotional resonance,” says Pekka Rantala, a former Nokia executive and now HMD Global’s chief mobile marketing officer, pointing out that the Nokia was likely the first mobile phone for many consumers. The market demands more than just a one-size-fits-all solution Nicolas Zibell He says the response to the 3310 has been “tremendous”. No one is denying the retro gadget is fun to look at and play with, but the device – true to its original roots – can only make phone calls, send SMS messages and play the mobile game “Snake”. You can’t go on Facebook and you can’t send e-mails. That doesn’t sound like a phone that many will actually want to use in a real-world situation. Rantala, of course, spins it like this: “The new 3310 is a great weekend phone for those who want to detox from social media.” At least the new Nokia smartphones get the software (stock Android) right. Rantala says HMD Global’s goal going forward is to release “well crafted” smartphones that work closely with Google to provide the most up-to-date software, security updates, and Google services. “We will work closely with Google to align our phones with their vision,” he says, “because Google services are the best services.” But here’s the thing: HMD Global is also aiming at the Chinese market – the Nokia 6, the new release with the best specs, was actually introduced in China before the Mobile World Congress – where Google services are banned. So how is HMD Global going to market Nokia phones as devices with the best Google apps when none of them can get over the Great Firewall? “I don’t have an answer for your question,” Rantala says. “But I believe that our partnership with Google opens up the opportunity to perhaps work things out with China.” Nokia’s comeback phone in China gets a collective yawn from buyers That’s a pipe dream. Chinese consumers are likely to stick with cheap local brands like Xiaomi, or “premium” phones from Huawei or Apple, rather than pay mid-tier prices for a Nokia or BlackBerry. A more realistic scenario for both brands is to appeal to the niche and emerging markets. According to research firm IDC, a disproportionate number of people in Indonesia are still using the long-abandoned BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) service, a fact Zibell is keen to explore. “The market demands more than just a one-size-fits-all solution,” he says. Why a BlackBerry needs a keyboard - head of China’s TCL talks up new smartphone at CES 2017 tech show Another senior BlackBerry executive concedes the brand doesn’t have lofty goals for now. Speaking to TechCrunch at the Mobile World Congress, BlackBerry’s mobile division general manager Bruce Walpole said if even one in eight consumers pick up the new BlackBerry, the company would be satisfied. Perhaps having the backing of a billion-dollar Chinese conglomerate (TCL owns another phone brand, Alcatel, and also makes smart televisions) takes a lot of pressure off the brand. HMD Global, however, doesn’t have that luxury. The company is small compared with other phone makers, and put together by a group of Finns. To them, the success of the Nokia brand isn’t just about making money or even restoring Nokia’s legacy, it’s about bringing pride back to the country. “Nokia was once the pride and joy of Finland,” Rantala says. “We want to bring the brand back to show the world why Finland was once the mobile capital of the world.” The early response to the classic Nokia 3310 has been strong (less so for the other models).

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube -- an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than 2 million other third-party websites.

Coinciding with today's announcement, it's also released its first Developer Preview, offering those who create software for the platform an early glimpse of what to expect in the coming months. Google said that "the O Developer Preview includes an updated SDK with system images for testing on the official Android Emulator". The company has also launched a new Developer Preview site with resources on the new edition, along with information on behavior changes and new APIs in the OS. This first Developer Preview will be supported on six devices: Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel C Pixel Pixel XL Google emphasizes - in more than one place - that "Developer Preview 1 is for developers only and not intended for daily or consumer use." Those who plan to install it are urged to read the release notes before doing so. A consumer beta will be released "as we get closer to a final product".

According to a report from TechCrunch, it seems that Google has some kind of group photo editing app that they are working on. Google has since confirmed the existence of the app, but apparently they claim that this is merely an experiment and one of many that they are running. This means that there is no guarantee that the app will be released, but from what TechCrunch is reporting, it sounds rather interesting as it is an app that allows small groups edit photos together. They have described it as being an app like Path meets Snapchat-style filters meets Google photo editing smarts. So far image editing apps have been largely a single-user experience, so it will be interesting to see what a group/social image editing app will be like, but presumably it will be collaborative in nature.

However all is not lost because while Google Talk will be shutting down, Google has announced that it will be integrated into Hangouts instead, so there is always that option if you’re interested. In an announcement on its blog, Google has confirmed that Google Talk will be saying its goodbyes. According to Google, “Talk users within Gmail will receive a prompt in the next few weeks, inviting them to switch to Hangouts. After June 26, users will be automatically transitioned to Hangouts, unless contractual commitments apply. For users that preferred the Google Talk look, there is a Dense Roster setting in Hangouts that provides a similar experience.” For those who are unfamiliar with Google Talk, if you’ve ever used Gmail you might have noticed that you will be able to hold conversations with some of your contacts within the Gmail window itself, which is basically Google Talk. Users of Hangouts know that those conversations can carry on within Hangouts itself, so essentially the feature is being removed from within Gmail. We suppose there is some appeal to Google Talk as it allows users to chat while having Gmail open, which might be handy if you’re at work and don’t want your boss to see you chatting. It also saves users from having to open another tab or window, but we guess for now users will just have to start getting used to using Hangouts instead. Filed in General.

Abhijit Ahaskar With Android O, Google is trying to limit the activities of background apps even when you are working on other apps in the foreground. Google has released a developer preview called O for the next version of Android. What the O will be finally named will be decided later this year when the new OS and the new Pixel smartphones will be released. The developer preview provides app developers an early look into the features of the new OS so they can test and validate their apps for the new OS. This allows them to make their apps ready by the time new OS is available to consumers. Google will provide more details on the upcoming OS at the Google I/O Conference in May 2017. Here are some of the key features of the upcoming Android OS. Better battery Battery backup has been at the top of Google’s agenda since last couple of years. With Doze and Doze 2.0, they have been able to minimize battery drain caused by background activities. However, this worked only when the phone was not being used. With Android O, Google is trying to limit the activities of background apps even when you are working on other apps in the foreground. Apps in the background will be updated or synced less frequently. If a user is busy and can’t check a notification right away but doesn’t want to miss it either, they can snooze a notification to show up after a few minutes again. Smarter notifications With Android N, Google made notifications panel more interactive. And, with Android O, they have taken it a step further. Users can club their notifications into channels. So all notifications from news apps will show up together under news and all notifications from social media apps will show separately under social media. User can fine tune their notifications further by creating categories within these channels. Also, if a user is busy and can’t check a notification right away but doesn’t want to miss it either, they can snooze a notification to show up after a few minutes again. Superior audio The new OS will require some hardware upgrades from phonemakers too, as far as new phones are concerned. Android O will support advanced Bluetooth audio codecs such as Sony’s LDAC codec. It enables transmission of three times more audio data compared to audio transmitted through standard Bluetooth audio codecs. This means smartphones with Android O will be able to stream higher quality audio even during Bluetooth streaming. Wireless connectivity made better Another notable feature that could be seen in Android O is Wi-Fi Aware. Also known as Neighbour Awareness Networking (NAN), this technology allows users to connect and communicate with other users in their vicinity over a secure wireless network. This will allow users to chat with each others over messengers, send and receive files and even challenge each other in two player games without requiring an internet connection. More options on lockscreen This option to access an app from the lockscreen itself is very popular with users. In phones running stock Android UI, shortcuts are limited to camera or phone call. A lot of custom UIs allow users more options such as access to Facebook or Google Maps first thing after the lockscreen. With Google O uses can customise the lockscreen shortcuts and add more options and the ones that they actually want. With Android O, users can superimpose a new shape or design over the app icons. New look icons The idea behind stock Android is to keep things lighter, but at times the interface looks too bland. With Android O, users can superimpose a new shape or design over the app icons. User can choose the shapes and even add some animations when they interact with the apps. This will give the interface a more symmetrical and lively look. Better cache management Android O will allocate a fixed amount of storage space for every app’s cached data. When a user clears cached data in the phone’s settings, cached data of those apps will be deleted first that have exceeded their limit. The system will also delete the oldest cache files first.

I'll let you into a little secret though: Most of the time, I'm not doing anything all that impressive or magical. Troubleshooting basic computer problems is actually pretty straightforward. Picture: KJBevan/Shutterstock That's not to belittle the excellent work of genuine computer repair professionals — or to say that every problem is a simple one — but there are some basic steps you can work through before getting someone else in to take a look. Here's how to tackle it yourself. And, yes, I will still come and reinstall Windows for you in return for a couple of beers. Google well Neighbours and relatives have gratefully given me actual money for coming to their house and Googling their computer problems for them. It's not a cop out — it's a really helpful way of working out what's going wrong. That said, you need to be as specific as you possibly can in your queries and cut through the masses of results you're likely to get back. Chances are, someone has suffered the same issue as you, and probably found a fix too. Ignore sponsored results and links selling software and concentrate on forum posts or (even better) official sources from the software and hardware companies involved. Is there a fix you can download? Or a guide you can follow? If you're coming across a lot of different results and potential solutions, look for ones that users confirm have worked, or which have been approved by official sources. Most major software and hardware firms now have useful online troubleshooting tools, so hunt down those too — they may not always appear in your search results. Rebooting is cliche for a reason It's the most obvious cliche out there, but there's some truth in it, like most cliches — it even works for Boeing Dreamliners. Reboot your computer, your printer, your router, your mobile phone, your USB hub and everything else you're having a problem with. By reboot, we mean turn it off, wait a good minute or two, and turn it back on. Why does it work so well? It clears out all of the temporary (and potential dodgy) information from the memories of your different bits of hardware and forces them to start from scratch, whether that's connecting to Wi-Fi or loading a game. It also closes down apps or bits of code that shouldn't really be running. Some applications handle reboots better than others, but it's always best to go through the official shutdown and reboot process for your OS rather than pulling the plug (unless you have no choice) — it gives programs chance to save your work and do whatever housekeeping needs to be done before they start up again with a clean slate. Reinstall and update your applications Rebooting clears out the temporary gunk hanging around in your computer's memory but it won't affect anything permanently written to disk: Corrupt setting files, damaged data that should have been trashed but hasn't, and other bits of digital detritus will still be hanging around. An app reinstall can help fix that, and you should give it a try if one program in particular is proving problematic. Uninstalling and reinstalling an application not only clears out any corrupt data or broken settings, it also ensures you're running the latest version of the software, complete with the latest compatibility updates and bug fixes (assuming you get it from the web). Drivers and firmware aren't as important as they once were on computer systems but they're still worth a mention: Check in with manufacturer websites to see if any code updates are available for your graphics card, printer or other hardware components, particularly if there's one bit of kit that's giving you trouble. Check for spyware and malware If you're still having problems with system crashes and general sluggishness, a spyware or malware program may have taken root on your machine. Update your antivirus and antispyware software to the latest versions and run the most comprehensive scans they has. We've previously looked at the best choices. The more sophisticated types of malware out there know what an antivirus program looks like and will guard against attack or reinstall themselves once you reboot. Standalone scanners, like Microsoft Safety Scanner or McAfee Stinger, can sometimes get around this and excise particularly nasty infections. It's also worth checking up on the programs running in the background while your computer is on. Launch Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor on Mac to look for anything suspicious (there's no shame in running a web search for any entries you don't understand to check if they should be there or not). Do some simple investigating Some simple detective work can do wonders for finding solutions to PC problems. It's not always possible, but if you're having trouble with one bit of hardware, try replacing it with another: If it works, you've identified the source of the issue and can take appropriate action (like buying a new keyboard). There are plenty of useful, free diagnostics tools out there to lend a hand. DiskCheckup (Windows) and Onyx (Mac) can scan your hard drive for errors and clean up certain problems, while the much-loved CCleaner (Windows or Mac) is great for tidying up temporary files that shouldn't be hanging around. Dell has a variety of diagnostics programs you can use to try and get a better handle on what the problem is, while Windows has its own troubleshooter tool in the Action Center. If you're on an Apple computer you can run the integrated Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics depending on the age of your machine. Reinstall your operating system We've talked about emptying your computer's memory and cleaning up data files, and reinstalling Windows or Mac OS is the ultimate version of that. In the past, this used to be a long-winded and potentially dangerous process, but Apple and Microsoft have now made it so straightforward that it's almost worth doing regularly whether you're having problems or not. It's like a factory reset for your phone: Your computer will go back to being as it was when you first bought it. That means broken files, corrupt data, dodgy extensions and any viruses (except the most low-level and persistent ones) will be wiped away. So will all your documents, photos, emails, apps and settings too, so make sure you have everything safely backed up. You'll need to check the official instructions for whatever OS you have installed, but if you're running the latest versions of Windows or Mac OS X then it's not a complicated process. In both cases you can choose to try resetting the system files without touching your own data before going for a full reinstall. What's next? This is a cheatsheet for basic troubleshooting, not a catch-all for every problem out there. If something serious is going on — like a failing hard drive or a persistent virus — then calling in the help of a professional is a good idea. It's worth checking what kind of warranty and support options are offered by whoever sold you the computer as a first port of call. And, if you still can, back everything up. This is something you should be doing anyway, but most people don't think about it until their laptop or desktop dies. You can eventually replace your computer (even if you have to save up for a while), but precious photos and important documents are less easy to get back again.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION A consistent UI between your phone and this car makes perfect sense John Brandon@jmbrandonbb March 25, 2017 5:00 PM Tags: connected cars, transportation, VW Beetle Dune Image Credit: VW Technology can be a wild beast. Anyone who lives and breathes tech knows the rules are always changing. One day a certain smartphone, say the Google Pixel, is the coolest thing ever, the next you find out everyone has moved on to some other Android model. You try a new travel website that uses machine learning to find the best deals, and then you realize there’s a new app for your tablet that works much better. Driving today is equally variable. Climb into a Ford Escape and you’ll see an interface that’s been upgraded from the one the car had a few years ago. (Thankfully, it’s much better.) And if you switch between a few different cars for test drives at a dealership, there’s a good chance you’ll get confused about how to perform simple tasks, like syncing your phone over Bluetooth. That’s why, on a recent test of the 2017 VW Beetle Dune, it became clear how important a consistent interface is for the modern digital age. The car itself is fantastic — it uses a lower profile and has fine accents along the trim that are a throwback to the days of the original Southern California version. But what impressed me most is that once I hooked up my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone over USB, the interface for Android Auto popped up immediately. I’ve tested Apple CarPlay many times, but I had forgotten how slick Android Auto is. There’s a simple row of icons at the bottom. (You don’t even need to bother setting up Bluetooth, although that’s the only way to do a hands-free phone call.) You select a map icon — one for your phone and one for music. In the center, there’s a button you can use to access the Google Assistant, although in my tests it was obviously a simplified version. Mostly, the voice assistant helps you get directions. You can ask questions, but we’re not talking about the bot in the Google Home speaker here. In response to most of my test questions, the Android Auto bot kept saying it could not help with that. Those same questions lead to a much better result on Google Home. That said, the feature is not as distracting in the car. If you ask about pizza or seafood, for example, the bot will likely show a list of local eateries. The interface is clean and tidy, just like the one on the phone. I didn’t have to learn anything. In Google Maps, I already knew where to find the option to do a search. Even the voice was familiar. In Google Music, I picked an option to see my most recently played tracks. It’s slick because it is exactly the same as you see on the phone itself, which can help prevent distracting driving. You can plug in, punch in a song you want, get directions, and focus on driving. It’s worth noting that this is a good match for the Beetle Dune for another reason. The car is designed for having fun when you drive and for taking corners fast. It’s mostly about style, as well — the car is incredibly eye-catching, so much so that people kept asking about it when I parked. Since the focus is on driving and style, using Android Auto meant I didn’t have to learn how to use any of the dashboard options. There’s no adaptive cruise control or steering aids. Overall, the interface helped me focus on what was important — that is, making sure I put the turbocharged engine through its paces on some curvy roads.

Will Hutton Germany challenges Facebook on personal data, Google agrees to police its ads: are these landmark events? Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Saturday 25 March 2017 20.05 EDT The internet celebrated its 28th birthday a fortnight ago. It’s an invention that ranks alongside the wheel, immunisation against disease and the internal combustion engine as a transformer of human existence. As an open information digital connector, it is an extraordinary force for individual liberation, embodying the very best of Enlightenment values: more information is available to more people through their mobile phones and personal computers than ever before. The world can then follow the Enlightenment injunction to dare to know to a degree that the great philosophers, arguing for a free public realm where information and evidence could be openly marshalled and tested for human betterment, could never have foreseen. Over the last 18 months, it has become obvious that the internet is the most serious threat to the Enlightenment values it purports to represent. As Tim Berners-Lee, the web’s inventor, wrote in a salutary open letter to mark its birthday, these are worrying times. The combination of losing control of our personal data, the monumental growth of misinformation and fake news and evolution of abusive, targeted “programmatic” advertising, particularly political advertising, constitutes a mortal threat to our civilisation. There is a new capacity to manipulate opinion and control our lives by companies, governments and political parties that makes Orwell’s warnings seem tame. Trump in the US and Brexit in Europe, events possibly influenced by the new disregard for fact and capacity to manipulate, are but storm warnings of where these trends are taking us. How we spend money, formulate ideas and cast votes are manipulatable and controllable as never before. In the UK, the government has taken powers to survey and monitor our emails and texts. In the private sector, Facebook and Google know more about our preferences, which can be shamelessly exploited by political and commercial advertisers. Worse, on Wednesday, as the government triggers article 50, we are set to leave one of the great sources of countervailing power and digital protection – the European Union. This will be presented as “liberation” by Leavers: rather, it is a moment of enthralment, when Britain weakens its capacity to combine with others to fight for Enlightenment freedoms against the digital behemoths that would dismantle them. One battleground became more vivid last week – the struggle to create a level playing field between information producers, such as publishers and newspapers, and those making fortunes, such as Facebook and Google, by making content available online. The law has developed to balance publishing freedoms with necessary responsibilities. Even most libertarians accept that publishing freedoms should not extend to incitements to murder, race hatred or violence. Equally, defamation and libel law tries to protect against the dissemination of falsehood and lies. Publishers and newspapers spend a great deal of money on getting their facts right to comply with the law. Readers have come to trust that what they read will have been rigorously screened to be true. The founding principle of the open worldwide web is that it is open. The great claim of Google and Facebook is that they are not publishers, but intermediaries and search engines that use this system to make universal digital wares produced by others. They have built an infrastructure to house data and refresh web pages in unthinkable volumes – Facebook has 1.9bn users, more than a quarter of humanity – to which advertisers are flocking. They are phenomenally profitable – Facebook’s revenues in the last three months of 2016 were $8.8bn – and they organise their affairs to pay as little tax as possible. Facebook sells advertising by enabling users to read what newspapers have published; newspapers lose the advertising revenue but still must comply with the law. The internet companies’ claim, supported by US law, is that they are conduits for information and are not publishers subject to the expensive business of ensuring that what their users access is true, non-defamatory and does not incite civilisation-damaging behaviour. It is bunkum. Worse, the advertising draining from newspapers is reaching such a scale that the viability of a free press is under threat. Online newspapers can charge subscribers, but still need advertising to support journalism and the expensive edifice of complying with publishing law. At the very least, as upholders of true news, they should be competing with Google and Facebook on equal terms. Last week, Google, owner of YouTube, had to accept that it has publishing responsibilities, a landmark moment. Advertisers were not prepared to see their ads alongside videos celebrating terrorism and Google, faced with a mounting strike from clients, acknowledged that it would have to police its videos and ads more rigorously. Meanwhile, the German government, with the EU commission, is preparing to fine social networking sites up to $50m if they fail to take down fake news, hate speech and defamatory content within 24 hours of it being posted. German competition authorities are taking Facebook to court for issuing blanket, incomprehensible consumer agreements that mean users have to cede all rights over their personal data. The EU commission has confirmed that it is considering whether the approach to harvesting personal data breaches EU anti-trust rules and the EU’s data protection directive, coming into force next year, has given every EU citizen the right to ensure their data is not abused. It is a battle that, by 2019, British citizens will be fighting alone. Leavers live in a fantasy world in which these battles can be better fought without the EU. But the fight against fake news, abuse of personal data and the battle for more digital transparency is international. The EU is the power bloc that takes the challenge to insist data and information are properly used more seriously than any other. Donald Trump is no ally: he has repealed the US oil and mining industries’ digital obligation to reveal payments to foreign governments and his embrace of fake news is notorious. Tim Berners-Lee’s warnings are profound. If an open internet is to benefit humanity and not degenerate into a vehicle to oppress us, then we have to stand with others to exercise equivalent power. From Wednesday, that will be very much harder – perhaps one of the most important reasons to regret the folly of Brexit.

They plan to land a privately funded probe on the moon and send a small robot craft trundling over the lunar surface. If they succeed they will open up the exploitation of the moon for mining and ultimately human colonisation – and earn $20m prize money as winners of the Google Lunar XPrize. Out of the 29 companies that originally entered the competition, only five remain in contention. Each has until the end of 2017, the XPrize deadline, to launch its robot mission. SpaceX to send two people around the moon who paid for a 2018 private mission Read more It is an extraordinarily ambitious task. To date, not a single piece of any competitor’s hardware has flown outside Earth’s atmosphere, while two of the rockets earmarked to send craft to the moon have still to undergo test launches. As a result, many observers now wonder if anyone will win the Google XPrize given its tight timetable. Naveen Jain, co-founder of Moon Express – one of the five remaining competitors – is bullish, however. “We have tested our lander. We have tried out all our hardware and software and we have raised all the money we need to complete the mission. We are very confident.” The rules for the Google XPrize are straightforward. The winning robot craft must be the first to land on the moon and must then travel 500 metres over the lunar surface while sending back high-resolution images to Earth. At the same time, at least 90% of the mission must be commercially funded. The first team to succeed in this undertaking will win $20m, with further bonuses on offer. For example, a spacecraft that not only lands successfully but also survives a lunar night – which lasts for two Earth weeks when temperatures drop to minus 173 degrees – will win an extra prize of several million dollars. The aim of the exercise is “to incentivise space entrepreneurs to create a new era of affordable access to the moon and beyond,” say the organisers. It was set up 10 years ago, attracting considerable interest from aerospace investors. Most would-be competitors have since dropped out as the technical hurdles of the mission have proved too onerous. The five now left are: Returning to Earth was the real nail-biting part of the Apollo missions. Competitors won’t have to worry about that. Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal ■ TeamIndus of India. Set up by dotcom entrepreneur Rahul Narayan, this outfit is backed by a several major Indian businesses. ■ Hakuto of Japan, which has developed its own four-wheel rover for trundling over the lunar surface ■ Israel’s SpaceIL. It has received substantial backing from American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and it wants to create an “Apollo moment” when it lands, thus inspiring the young to pursue careers in science and engineering. ■ Synergy Moon, an international concern with individuals from 15 countries, which will use a Neptune 8 rocket, built and launched by Interorbital Systems, to carry a lander and at least one rover to the moon. ■ Moon Express. Funded by Naveen Jain, the founder of dotcom search giant InfoSpace, it has set its sights on mining the moon for minerals and is the only competitor yet to receive permission from the US Federal Aviation Administration to land a craft on the lunar surface. Most of the challengers have invested sums up to $60m to develop their technology – though several have to finalise this funding. The benefits of taking part in the competition were nevertheless clear, said the Astronomer Royal, Martin Rees. “Challenge prizes like these are very good ideas. They have played major roles in developing driverless cars and the development of private launch systems like Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and they could do the same for roboticised space missions.” In future, said Rees, humanity would depend more and more on robot craft to assemble telescopes and to build orbiting solar power plants and to operate mines on asteroids. “Such operations are not likely to be in use for many decades, but challenges like these definitely help to get things moving.” It remains to be seen if any of the missions make it to the moon by the end of the year. All are rudimentary in concept, are largely untested and employ a wide variety of technologies. Moon Express will not use a rover to cross the lunar surface, for example. It will employ the craft’s rocket engines to hop across it. Similarly, its craft will be launched on a Rocket Lab electron launcher, from New Zealand, while Synergy Moon’s rocket will blast off from an ocean launch pad. This wide variety of approaches has left some bemused observers viewing the competition as a lunar Wacky Races. For his part, Moon Express’s chief executive Bob Richards acknowledged that its lander did look a bit like a flying washing machine. “Actually it looks more like R2-D2. But it will work,” he insisted. However, one awkward task that faced past lunar efforts – returning to Earth – will not be a problem that will affect these competitors. Yes, they will have to overcome the headaches of launching a spacecraft from Earth and they will have to land it gently on the moon, a world that lacks atmosphere and thus precludes the use of parachutes. However, there is no requirement in the Google XPrize regulations for competitors to bring their craft back to Earth. They will be left on the lunar surface as possible visiting sights for future tourists. “That does make things a little easier,” said Rees. “Returning to Earth was the real nail-biting part of the Apollo missions. At least competitors won’t have to worry about that.” As to follow-up missions, competitors are also divided. SpaceIL says that if it wins the XPrize, the money will be invested – not on further space missions but into educational grants. By contrast, Moon Express has pledged that regardless of winning the prize or not it intends to embark on a long-term strategy of mining on the moon. “This effort is just the start,” said Richards. “We see a real future up there.” Topics The moon The Observer Space Google news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

But not if you want to work for a large, established technology company. Amazon, together with Google and Apple, is now among the biggest recruiters from top-tier business school campuses around the world, rivalling traditional employers such as investment banks. Only consultancies hired more MBA graduates than Amazon at London Business School and Berkeley’s Haas School of Business in California last year. The online retailer was the number-one recruiter of MBAs at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business in 2016. Miriam Park, a masters in management graduate from MIT Sloan School of Management, is director of university programmes recruitment at Amazon. Her team last year hired MBA graduates “in the high hundreds” across the world. She declines to give a precise figure, but says the number of new entrants at MBA level was about 30 per cent higher than the previous 12 months. “I don’t foresee that growth rate slowing down any time soon,” she says. Starting salaries at Amazon range from $137,000 for a programme manager to $180,000 for a senior product manager, including signing bonuses, according to Transparent Career, a tech company that aggregates self-reported data in first jobs from recent MBA graduates. This compares with an average for consultancy positions of $165,000, and $170,000 for those taking jobs at investment banks. “What we find with the MBAs is that they want to create, they want to build and they want to take risks,” says Ms Park. “They’re fairly adaptable, they have a high level of what I would call ability to deal with ambiguity. Couple that with MBAs who have a great analytical bent and it’s the perfect pipeline.” Such skills are prized at Amazon, according to Ms Park. “We do something called working backwards from the customer,” she says. “This requires people who are good at analysing and diving deep and saying, what does the data actually tell us?” Amazon is a partner company on Ross’s Multidisciplinary Action Project, a core part of the school’s MBA course. A team of students spends seven weeks at Amazon, enabling both sides to decide if they want to work with one another, according to Damian Zikakis, director of career services at Ross. The retailer appeals to MBAs over other recruiters, according to Ms Park, because of the extent of its global reach, with ecommerce operations in 11 countries and customers in 185 nations. “If the MBA candidate happens to go to school in North America but actually really desires to be placed in India or China or London, we make those connections happen between our teams,” she says. Andrew Hill Business school: Working styles and CEOs find ‘flow’ with drugs A newsletter to help business students with their education and career Tuesday, 28 March, 2017 Amazon’s interest in MBAs is partly a reflection of its evolution from a 1990s dotcom start-up into one of the world’s largest companies by market capitalisation. As such it needs people who can develop strategy, manage project teams and create new services. But its size today attracts criticism. Amazon has adopted an MBA graduate hiring model in the same mould as banks and consultancies, according to Bhavik Trivedi, managing partner at Critical Square, an applicant advisory service. “They bring in highly talented people, churn and burn them in two to four years, and keep the cycle going,” Mr Trivedi says. “Some will stay and rise. The rest, they’ll be replaced.” Ms Park rejects the suggestion that Amazon does not care about developing new hires, noting that the company operates several fast-track management development schemes, such as its Pathways programme, which prepare MBA graduates for general manager, director and vice-president roles. “They enter as cohorts so they have a network of peers in addition to the programme leaders,” Ms Park says. Hiring MBA graduates is a natural next stage in the development of Amazon, which is as much concerned about improving large-scale logistics for delivery from its ecommerce site today as it is in finding analysts to develop new services, according to Ms Park. Amazon also has fans, such as Susan Cera, a director of Stratus Admissions Counseling. A big attraction of Amazon to MBA students, she says, is that it combines a start-up mentality in developing new online services with the security of a multinational business. This means that a new hire can hope to work there long enough to pay off their college debt. “Amazon is constantly entering new markets, which provides opportunities for a newly minted MBA to learn about being an entrepreneur in a low-risk environment with established infrastructure and support systems in place,” Ms Cera says. “Most MBAs we counsel don’t view Amazon as a pure tech company because much of Amazon’s success is due to smart financial management.” Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

As its name suggested, the device was aimed primarily at business customers, and featured a decent set of upper-mid-range specs. Today, VAIO unveiled a new smartphone... except that it's not really a new smartphone at all. The VAIO Phone Biz with Windows 10 Mobile, which launched a year ago Since the Phone Biz launched last year, Windows 10 Mobile has continued to sink like a stone in the global smartphone market; according to IDC, Microsoft's OS grabbed just 0.1% market share around the world in 2017. The Phone Biz has only ever been sold in Japan, where the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech indicates that Windows has a slightly better 1.5% share of the country's smartphone market. Almost half of all smartphones sold in Japan are iPhones, while around 49% is made up of Android handsets. Given that demand for Android devices is significantly larger than for Windows phones, it's no great surprise that VAIO's second smartphone isn't running Microsoft's operating system, but Google's instead. Spot the difference But what is certain to raise an eyebrow or two is the fact that the new VAIO Phone A, which the company announced today, is nearly identical to the Phone Biz that it released almost a year ago. And we're not just talking about its design - the new Android model has almost exactly the same specs as last year's Windows 10 Mobile version. While its key specs were perfectly acceptable a year ago, the mobile world moves quickly, and the Phone A's specs look far less impressive today in what VAIO is presenting as a 'new' phone: Here's an overview of the key specs of the VAIO Phone A: 5.5-inch LCD with Full HD (1920x1080px) resolution Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor (1.5GHz + 1.2GHz) 3GB RAM 16GB storage (plus microSD card support up to 64GB) 13MP rear camera 5MP front-facing camera Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Bluetooth 4.2 4G LTE connectivity (bands 1, 3, 8, 19, 21) microUSB 2.0 Mono speaker GPS 2800mAh battery 156.1 x 77 x 8.3mm; 167g In fact, the only significant difference between the Phone A and the older Phone Biz is that the new model supports dual SIM cards. "It's the same phone!" Worse still, the Phone A isn't even running one of the latest versions of Android. Google released Android 7.0 Nougat seven months ago, and the newest publicly available version is 7.1.1, while 7.1.2 is currently being beta-tested. VAIO is shipping the Phone A with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, which Google originally made available in December 2015. When the Phone Biz launched last year, it was priced at ¥50,000 JPY (around $450 USD at current exchange rates). Its price has since fallen to just under ¥32,200 (roughly $290). Pricing for the VAIO Phone A hasn't yet been announced, but if you're actually considering buying this device, you'll be able to reserve one from March 30, ahead of general availability on April 7. Somewhat optimistically, VAIO has set up a toll-free phone number for those wishing to discuss purchases.

This means sectors like manufacturing, education, and tech will soon be relying on machine intelligence to get the job done. Like always, Intel is following in the footsteps of other tech giants like Apple and Google to stay ahead in the AI game. Intel recently acquired Nervana, which focuses solely on AI. According to the press release, the company will be aligning its AI efforts under a single cross-Intel organization: the Artificial Intelligence Products Group (AIPG). “I am personally very energized about the opportunities before us as an industry. As CEO of Nervana, an AI company that Intel acquired last year, I saw what could be done. Now, after six months here, I see how the world can change when a company like Intel focuses on an effort. I believe this new organization will have a huge impact, not only for Intel, but upon the entire evolving AI space,” said Naveen Rao, who is now the vice president and general manager of the Artificial Intelligence Products Group at Intel. According to analysts from Technavio, the global artificial intelligence market in the industrial sector to grow at a CAGR of 52.65 percent during 2017-2021. The artificial intelligence (AI) market in the United States education sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 47.5 percent during 2017-2021, according to a new report by market research firm Research and Markets. As part of this AI initiative, Intel will be exploring novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to inform future generations of AI. “This includes a range of solutions from the data center to edge devices, and from training to inference – all designed to enable Intel and its customers to innovate faster. This will be the home for AI innovation at Intel,” said Rao. As always, Intel aims to be a trend setter. The company has earlier made its presence felt in computational trends, such as personal and cloud computing. “Intel intends to rally the industry around a set of standards for AI that ultimately brings down costs and makes AI more accessible to more people – not only institutions, governments and large companies, as it is today,” he said. “Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the world around us and will bring new capabilities to everything from smart factories to drones to sports to health care and to driverless cars. Data is the common thread across all these applications, and our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across every industry,” he added.

The competition is part of Intel’s strategy for enabling state-of-the-art AI in the industry by working, among other ways, to make AI training and tools broadly accessible to developers through the Intel® Nervana™ AI Academy. Registration for the competition began last week. The entry deadline is June 14. The prize pool totals $100,000 for the top-three finishers, including $50,000 for the first-place competitor. Additionally, a $20,000 special prize will be awarded to the competitor with the Best Intel Tools Usage. See the official registration site for complete rules. “We aim to challenge developers, data scientists and students to develop AI algorithms to help solve real-world challenges in industries including medical and health care,” said Doug Fisher, senior vice president and general manager of the Software and Services Group at Intel. Intel's Aicha Evans says 5G will be the biggest shift many of us see in our lives. No pressure, 5G. https://t.co/ljDkhlFh3r pic.twitter.com/z6IwkI5CBG — Intel IT Center (@IntelITCenter) March 4, 2017 “It is inspiring to see how MobileODT’s breakthrough optical diagnostic devices and software services, combined with Intel-based AI that Kagglers develop through this competition, will greatly improve MobileODT’s quality assurance workflow. This will aid the ability to make real-time determinations on treatment, and provide a first-line response to women around the world to help detect cervical cancer early,” he said.

However sometimes these deals aren’t always so obvious in app stores, but Android users need not worry as Google has launched a new “Free App of the Week” section within Google Play. This section can be accessed in the Play Store on the web or on mobile. All you have to do is go to the main page of the Play Store and scroll down and you will find a “Free App of the Week” section. Of course there are more free apps or discounted apps than just the one that is being shown, so in reality this section just points out to users what apps that they can check out. As it stands the free app will is “Card Wars – Adventure Time” which is ending in a few days. The price of the game is normally set at $2.99 but it will be free for the next few days. So if you do like a good deal every now and then, you can check out this particular section to see what is new.

By Conor Dougherty New York Times  March 27, 2017 NEW YORK — Now that Republicans are in charge, the federal government is poised to roll back regulations limiting access to consumers’ online data. States have other ideas. As on climate change, immigration, and a host of other issues, some state legislatures may prove to be a counterweight to Washington by enacting new regulations to increase consumers’ privacy rights. Advertisement Illinois legislators are considering a “right to know” bill that would let consumers find out what information about them is collected by companies like Google and Facebook, and what kinds of businesses they share it with. Such a right, which European consumers already have, has been a longtime goal of privacy advocates. Two other proposals face a crucial Illinois House committee vote this week. One would regulate when consumers’ locations can be tracked by smartphone applications, and another would limit the use of microphones in Internet-connected devices like mobile phones, smart TVs, and personal assistants like Amazon’s Echo. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Should they be passed into law, these rules could end up guiding the rights of consumers far beyond Illinois — because they would provide a model for other states, and because it would be difficult for technology companies with hundreds of millions of users to create a patchwork of state- and country-specific features to localize their effects. Congress is pushing to overturn regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration that limit the collection of data by broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast. The Senate approved the rollback last week, and the House is expected to follow this week. Congressional Republicans argue the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like Facebook and Google. They also say, more broadly, that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation. Advertisement Illinois is not the only place where state legislators are asserting themselves in the opposite direction. California and Connecticut, for example, recently updated laws that restrict government access to online communications like e-mail, and New Mexico could follow soon. Last year, Nebraska and West Virginia passed laws that limit how companies can monitor employees’ social media accounts, while legislators in Hawaii, Missouri, and elsewhere are pushing similar bills for employees, as well as for students and tenants. “More and more, states have taken the position that if Congress is not willing or able to enact strong privacy laws, their legislatures will no longer sit on their hands,” said Chad Marlow, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. Online privacy is the rare issue that draws together legislators from the left and the far right. At the state level, anyway, some of the progress has come from a marriage between progressive Democrats and libertarian-minded Republicans, who see privacy as a bedrock principle, Mr. Marlow said. States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory. Be it tax cuts, emission regulations, gay rights, or gun laws, advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle. In the case of online privacy, consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration. Now they face a White House and a Congress looking to roll back regulations, not create them. But federal blockage can create local opportunities. “What you’re seeing is this growing recognition of the intrusiveness of these technologies, and some efforts — not to regulate them out of existence, but to regulate them in ways that allow people who care about this to preserve their own privacy,” said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission’s consumer protection bureau. “So what’s going to happen is California is going to supplant Congress, and it’s going to be augmented by states like Illinois, Minnesota, and even Texas in efforts to protect consumer privacy.” In Illinois, the “right to know” legislation recently cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, paving the way for a full vote in the next few weeks. Technology companies and their trade organizations are lobbying fiercely against it. “I think I created 30 jobs when I filed this bill,” said Michael Hastings, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the measure. He said lobbyists representing companies including Microsoft, Apple, Lyft, and Amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill. Several technology trade groups, including the Internet Association and NetChoice, have pushed publicly against the legislation. Carl Szabo, senior policy counsel at NetChoice, said the law could add a burden of compliance costs and legal fees on essentially any company with a website that collects information, even routine things like creating e-mail lists or giving online support to customers.

Homepage Follow Sign in / Sign up Home Apple Google Twitter Facebook Amazon Verizon Netflix Zander NethercuttBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Originally from the Bay Area, now living in Chicago. Kenyon College '16. Trying to figure it all out. Mar 23 The Death of Advertising And what will rise from its ashes. Subtlety. “The biggest advertisers on television are cars; retailers; CPG companies, all of which have business models that are fundamentally threatened by the internet. These are all companies that are mass market, but the offline mass market relative to the internet is a middle market, and the internet destroys mid-size businesses. It rewards niche businesses that have high differentiation and can charge a premium, and it rewards massive scale businesses that can operate internationally, at a scale unimaginable by even these giant companies. And one wonders, when and if this advertising shifts away from television, how much of it is going to be left?” — Ben Thompson, Exponent Episode #104: Snap’s Gingerbread Strategy The presence of advertising in our daily lives is akin to that of water in the life of a fish. It’s everywhere, and yet often, we remain oblivious to it, at least consciously; blind to the brightly colored billboard on the highway, or the flashing neon lights outside of a roadside motel. Our conscious minds, however, were never the targets of traditional advertising. The most effective advertising campaigns of the last fifty years were the ones we eventually forgot were there — the McDonald’s television ads delivered to us as children; the Coca-Cola slide in left field at AT&T park in San Francisco; the slogans that somehow made insurance more than a hedge against disaster. (“You’re in good hands”, “Nationwide is on your side!”, “15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance”, “Esurance — insurance, for the modern world”, “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there!”, to name a few. Also, I recalled those without external aid — such is the effectiveness of long-term, large-scale advertising campaigns.) Ever realize this was an ad? In the old world, there was no effective way to target individuals searching for niche products, so the companies that succeeded — the household names, so to speak — offered products that appealed to broad swaths of people, and advertised by reaching thousands, and in many cases, millions of people at once (see: Super Bowl and radio ads). The companies who ran successful advertising campaigns through these mediums, then, tended to be of a certain ilk, whether restaurant chains, car brands, department stores, insurance agencies, or brands under the umbrella of a larger consumer goods company. Enter the modern era, and the internet has flipped the traditional retail model — one characterized by massive investment into retail locations and brand advertising — on its head. Distance between buyer and seller no longer constrains sales — a consumer in Japan could just as easily obtain a watch manufactured in Detroit as a consumer in Detroit could obtain a Sake produced in Japan. The internet has given buyers and sellers unprecedented access to one another; it has never been easier for a buyer to find a seller who has what they need, just as it has never been easier for a seller to find a user who needs what they have. Google and Facebook ads are a microcosm of this effect. No longer is the cost of individual consumer acquisition so high that reaching a million consumers at once is the only effective way to advertise. Now, through Google and Facebook, niche businesses can target specific individuals whose data determines that they are prime candidates for said niche product or service. Bevel, a company that produces a suite of shaving products specifically for black men, would have been hung out to dry in the old world of advertising, because the majority of people their ads would’ve reached would’ve found them useless, or irrelevant. Now, however, Bevel can target its users with Google ads under certain keywords — for instance, when I type in “razors for black men” on Google, Bevel is the first promoted result. Facebook, too, allows Bevel to target users by age, racial demographic, and whatever other factors Bevel determines as indicative of interest in spending money on a shaving kit specifically for black men. If I were a black man in my mid-20s, had a Facebook account, and had searched for razors somewhere online before, Facebook’s algorithm would likely begin serving me ads for Bevel products. Once they did, and once I realized that those ads were for something that could improve my life, I would click one, which would cost Bevel a few cents on the dollar, make a purchase, and most importantly, do so immediately and regardless of my geographic location. In the end, what Bevel would have paid to acquire my hypothetical business would have been a fraction of a what a company like McDonald’s did to eventually acquire my actual business, twenty years ago, as it peppered me with constant television and radio ads that allowed me to catch my first glimpse of the golden arches, or hear the words “I’m lovin’ it!” echo throughout my living room for the first time. McDonald’s was smart enough to realize that given the advertising avenues they had to work with, and the homogeneity of the product they were selling, the only way to succeed was to invest deeply into mass market targeting, thereby pursuing long-term and large-scale consumer retention, albeit with a low per customer profit. Today, however, Bevel can target any person with an internet connection based on their user data, obtain a new customer immediately, regardless of where they are, and extract more money per transaction from that customer than a huge corporation like McDonald’s ever could from theirs — and they can do it at a fraction of the cost big brands once paid. This is the beauty of the internet. This doesn’t mean there isn’t still value in employing the shotgun approach, defined by blasting ads to huge audiences and seeing what sticks. Savvy marketing teams from companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s have used it to ensure that today, there are few soda machines in the world that do not contain Coke, and likely even fewer adults in the United States who do not recognize the golden arches as a symbol of consistency. Similarly, every time I walk through an airport, looking for something to eat, I’m presented with a plethora of options, from generic Chinese buffets to Latin-American grills. Always, though, I end up at McDonald’s, not because it’s the best, but because it’s what I know — and I know it for no other reason than that its brand has been subliminally imprinted in my brain to such a point that it has become the default option for food when I don’t know where to go, or simply don’t want to waste time thinking about it. This is the power of branding. To this day, McDonald’s advertising campaigns rest on reaching massive, heterogenous audiences, because their products appeal to the median consumer. Watching McDonald’s television ads in which five millennials, all of different racial backgrounds, but none deeply attached to one; all lean and attractive, but none so much so as to be intimidating, mill about, dancing and smiling while consuming small portions of McDonald’s food, is a reminder that McDonald’s isn’t trying to appeal to some of us — they’re trying to appeal to as many of us as they can, and reaching the median consumer does just that. Politicians use this strategy, too, and the ones who do it best get elected. Should they focus too heavily on fringe voters, they risk not garnering enough votes. The same applies to companies of the old world — there was little precedent for appealing to a niche market [1], and few means to do so. Thus, the successful companies of the old world, like the successful politicians of both that world, and today’s, appealed to the median, because there was no other way to win [2]. To elect a winner in the political market, voters choose with their vote. In a goods market, however, voters choose with their wallet. And while it is hard to imagine a political world not governed by the wishes of the majority [3], it is easier, given the current online landscape, to imagine a goods market no longer governed by the tastes of the “median voter” — a goods market no longer predicated on shotgun approaches to advertising, but rather on approaches that appeal to specific subsets of consumers — those who are willing to pay premiums for niche, high-quality products, like Bevel. In the old world, massive companies could rely on the moat of imperfect information to afford them long-term consumer loyalty, even with a mediocre, one-size-fits-all product. Now, in a world in which information is becoming less and less imperfect all the time, and the costs of advertising are ever decreasing per the increased word of mouth facilitated by avenues like YouTube and Facebook, the advantage enjoyed by large companies is fast dissipating. Gillette is an example. For decades, they sold razors at a premium, because they sat behind moats of massive advertising and distribution costs. The internet changed everything. Suddenly, a new competitor — Dollar Shave Club — was able to advertise cheaply through savvy social media use that generated amplified word of mouth, and distribute their product for a fraction of what companies like Gillette were charging, given their lack of a constraining retail presence or large investment into brand advertising. Dollar Shave Club was eventually acquired for one billion dollars by Unilever — a good indicator that their model is not only sustainable, but replicable — across all industries. Dollar Shave Club’s success indicates that the prevalence of shotgun advertising will fade over the decades to come. Companies that serve the masses will be replaced by companies that serve niches, because the latter will take advantage of the vastly decreased distribution costs and effective avenues for grassroots marketing that the internet provides. As this happens, and information about both buyers and suppliers becomes more and more perfect, the advantages enjoyed by producers of homogenous products like the Big Mac and Coke will dissipate, and their products will lose market share to more targeted, higher quality products that take advantage of unique, niche markets that were never able to be recognized, or more correctly, monetized, in the old world of advertising. The internet, the data it generates, and the companies that own and utilize that data best, will be the driving forces behind the monetization of niches. “You want to know who you really are? asks Dataism. “Then forget about the mountains and museums. Have you had your DNA sequenced? No?! What are you waiting for? Go and do it today. And convince your grandparents, parents, and siblings to have their DNA sequenced too — their data is very valuable for you. And have you heard about these wearable biometric devices that measure your blood pressure and heart rate twenty-four hours a day? Good — so buy one of those, put it on and connect it to your smartphone. And while you are shopping, buy a mobile camera and microphone, record everything you do, and put it online. And allow Google and Facebook to read all your emails, monitor all your Likes and clicks. If you do all that, then the great algorithms of the Internet-of-All-Things will tell you whom to marry, which career to pursue, and whether to start a war.” — Yuval Noah Harari, Homo Deus The perfection of data will, eventually, give rise to a world in every consumer can be paired up with goods that meet their biological tendencies, rather than their consumptive ones. This world will also be devoid of branding, because in a world that relies on perfect information, there will be no need for branded trust. The cheaper of two identical goods will always and everywhere be purchased, as opposed to what happens now, when a consumer pays more for Motrin, the brand, than Ibuprofen, the drug, even though they’re the same thing. Once perfect information becomes a reality, there won’t be just a few over-the-counter meds to alleviate pain, rather there will be hundreds, or even thousands depending on the specific needs of the niche markets. The purpose of advertising in this world, then, will be to pair niche consumers, whose needs were never profitable enough to be met, with niche products, whose production was never profitable enough to be realized. Given all of this, advertising as we’ve always known it — large-scale campaigns predicated on instilling subconscious intuition in consumers — will die. What will rise from its ashes be unlike anything we’ve seen before. It will not condition us to select from a menu of mediocrity, as it has done for centuries. Rather, the algorithms buried within the walls of companies like Google and Facebook will deterministically present us with our best options for everything from dinner to marriage, given the troves of user data they have at their disposal. At first, consumers may rebel, like they did with the advent of GPS in cars, or online shopping [4]. But as they realize that they are better served by allowing algorithms to take care of the decisions they once relied on their own autonomy to make, they will make the shift. It will not happen overnight, but it will happen. This new world will be marked by a monumental shift away from branding, which is already happening, a shift away from search, which is about to happen, but most important, and perhaps most unsettling, a shift away from trust in the user as the final indicator of their own desire. As we make this shift, and move towards a world in which data — and the mastery of its use — is king, ads will become deterministic. The companies that define this future will master the use of consumer data to inform ad delivery, and as they continue to amass user data, both their advertisements — and in turn, their data — will improve in tandem, until both are perfect. As this happens — and it will be a process, given that new consumers enter the world by the hundreds of thousands every day — our world will become one in which every consumer will be deterministically paired both with what they want, and what they need. In this new world, whether there will even be a difference is far from clear. Thanks for reading 🙏🏻🙏🏻! If you enjoyed this, please throw me a 💚 — it helps other people see the piece.

[2] Some might argue that Bernie Sanders is an exception to this rule — it wouldn’t appear that Sanders was attempting to appeal to “the middle” — but this is to misunderstand the idea of the median voter. Sanders ran a visionary campaign, but his near victory in the democratic primary came only because his vision literally shifted the median from one section of the voting populace to another. To his credit, he was the first in a long time to do this. Unfortunately for him, he didn’t shift it quite far enough. Trump’s eventual win was due to a combination of the Sanders strategy and the McDonald’s strategy. He ran a campaign based on a vision, however retrograde, that aligned with the views, and more importantly, the frustrations, of a long-forgotten median within the American voting populace. Almost more importantly, however, his message was disseminated among voters in a way that almost no political message ever has been, except in his case, he didn’t have to spend the money to do it. The media, regardless of how they framed it, pushed Trump’s message to those who would watch, and got him continual exposure. Voters in former coal mining towns in West Virginia, then, when they reached the primary polls, may never have heard of Marco Rubio, or Rand Paul. You can bet, however, that they had heard of Donald Trump, and his message: “Make America great again.” In four words, Trump captured the frustration, and in turn, loyalty, of a group that had had long believed themselves forgotten. With nothing more than the press of a key, or the scratch of pen, they afforded us the opportunity to remember. [3] Because someone will say it — the presidential election process within the United States is not technically governed by the majority. I know. [4] GPS in cars used to be awful. It’s now used everywhere, and it rocks.

Google's Play Store lacks a wide selection of apps that support a tablet's larger display, with most apps only expanding the phone interface, in turn looking horrible on the smaller screen. In addition to the lack of quality apps, Android tablets have lacked key accessories such as a keyboard. For the most part, Android tablets have been relegated to a device used to catch up on Netflix or to entertain kids with games. Samsung's $599 Galaxy Tab S3 is the Korean's company latest attempt to change that narrative. Well, as much as it can. After all, the company can't force third-party developers to build apps for a tablet. But Samsung has built a stylus and keyboard for the Tab S3, both of which go a long way in making it useful. After using the Tab S3 for just over a week, it's clear Samsung set the standard for Android tablets. This Tab S3 is the best Android-based tablet I've used, for work and play. In short: Business users who can't or simply refuse to use Apple products will find the Tab S3 a capable alternative to the iPad Pro. Specifications of the Galaxy Tab S3: Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Dimensions: 237.3 x 169.0 x 6.0mm Display: 9.7-inch Super AMOLED (2048x1536) w/HDR playback support Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Storage: 32 GB with microSD support up to 256GB Memory: 4GB Camera: 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel front-facing Video: 4K UDH at 30fps Ports: USB Type-C Fingerprint: Yes Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, LTE optional, GPS Battery: 6,000mAh w/Fast Charging Operating System: Android 7.0 Nougat Samsung Services: Samsung S-Pen, Samsung Air Command, Samsung Flow, Samsung Smart Switch A familiar design Jason Cipriani/ZDNet The first time I picked up the Tab S3 the fit and finish of an iPad came to mind, and that observation still holds (save for the Tab S3's glass back). Just below the 9.7-inch display is a home button that doubles as a fingerprint reader. The button is flanked by a multitasking button on the left and a back button on the right. On the right side of the tablet is where you find the microSD slot, volume up and down buttons, and the power button. On the left side of the frame is where you find the Pogo connector for interfacing with accessories such as a keyboard. A USB-C port and 3.5mm headphone jack are along the bottom of the frame. All about that S Pen Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Every Tab S3 comes with a super-sized S Pen stylus for jotting notes or sketching ideas on the tablet's display. Unlike the Apple Pencil, the S Pen lacks a battery or any sort of Bluetooth pairing process. Much like the S Pen's functionality on the Galaxy Note smartphone line, you hold the S Pen above the display and the tablet automatically recognizes it is present. With the press of a button on the side of the S Pen you can activate Air Commands. A series of round dots are shown, giving you the option to do things such as take a screenshot or create a note. For example, using an Air Command you can take a screenshot then annotate it with the S Pen before sharing it as a means of providing feedback to a colleague. Unlike the Note lineup, the S Pen on the Tab S3 is the size of a normal pen. Latest review Battle of the Android flagships: HTC 10, LG G5, and Samsung Galaxy S7 All three of these phones are outstanding and are priced lower than a comparable iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Read More As someone who owns an iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil, I was skeptical about how often I would use the S Pen. I hardly ever use the Apple Pencil, save for an occasional stick figure doodle in the Notes app out of sheer boredom. However, the Tab S3's screen-off memo feature made the S Pen a valuable tool. The feature works just as its name implies, you can jot down some notes without having to wake and unlock the tablet. Your note is then saved to Samsung's Notes app. I used this feature repeatedly to quickly write down an idea or create a list without much effort. Keyboard Jason Cipriani/ZDNet A physical keyboard for the Tab S3 is an optional accessory that will set you back $129. And really, it's something you need to buy in order to crank out emails or edit Word docs on the tablet. Samsung's virtual keyboard is good, but there's a lot to be said about a physical keyboard attached to a device that translates into productivity. That said, the Samsung Keyboard Case is cramped, and its small keys are something I'm still trying to adjust to. Just like Apple's Keyboard Cover, Samsung has done away with any sort of Bluetooth connection and battery. Instead, the keyboard is powered by a Pogo connector that pulls double-duty as a means for the keyboard to communicate with the tablet. Despite struggling to adjust to its size, I have used the Tab S3 quite frequently to reply to emails and type several documents. While it's not likely to be a huge selling point for the keyboard case, but Samsung includes an optional loop with each keyboard to hold the S Pen when not in use. Personally, I prefer the shallow keys and roomier feel of Apple's Smart Keyboard to that of Samsung's Keyboard Case. Performance and battery life Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Adding an S Pen and keyboard to the Tab S3 puts it firmly in the class of a productivity device, instead of something designed solely for watching movies. Speaking of watching movies, the Tab S3's display is stunning. It is HDR-ready for whenever streaming apps such as Amazon or Netflix begin offering the service. The overall performance of the Tab S3 with its year old Snapdragon 820 processor was with few hiccups during my time testing. The most prominent and noticeable slowdown of the device occurred nearly every time I used the keyboard shortcut of Alt-Tab to quickly switch between apps. Either the initial view of open apps would take a few seconds to show up, or quickly cycling through apps would cause the tablet to freeze then suddenly catch up to my commands. The same lag isn't present when using the tablet's multitasking button. Using Android Nougat's split screen feature to run two apps at the same time ran without issue. In fact, Android's overall multitasking implementation on a tablet with split screen apps and the mechanism for selecting a second app is something Apple should take into consideration for iOS 11. Samsung estimates 12 hours of use on a single charge, and I found that to be true. Standby time was also impressive, with the tablet's battery only dipping slightly after a couple of days sitting in my bag. Conclusion Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Samsung's Galaxy Tab S3 is a worthy contender to the iPad Pro for Android fans. It is reliable, offers similar battery life, and the addition of the S Pen and additional features can't be overlooked. It's unfortunate Android tablets are still plagued with a lack of high-quality apps. Although, Microsoft's Office suite of apps (that come preinstalled on the Tab S3), Slack, and Outlook fulfill many of the expectations and requirements of an enterprise user. Some have argued the Tab S3 is overpriced at $599, considering the keyboard isn't included. At the starting price of $599, you have to consider the inclusion of the S Pen -- something Apple charges $99 for for the same size iPad Pro that starts at the same $599 -- and the ability to expand storage through a microSD card items that justify the price. Is it expensive for an Android tablet? You bet. But this isn't just another Android tablet.

Earthquakes in and around Groningen in the Netherlands have proven extremely damaging, but have also opened up the region to unprecedented economic potential and a drive for an innovative economy supported by green energy. “I don’t think any of this would have been possible without the earthquakes”, says Marco Smit, director of Economic Board Groningen, in his office that overlooks Groningen’s high-tech university campus. The earthquakes, caused by natural gas drilling from NAM (half Shell and half Exxon-Mobil), have caused houses to collapse, families to move away from their roots and desperate protests. But it has also given rise to the realisation among the national government, local governments and businesses that Groningen could not continue relying on natural gas to support its economy. Rethinking Groningen In order to move away from a gas-based economy and not lose countless jobs in the process, a number of initiatives were started. Among them was the Economic Board Groningen, which manages a fund of about 100 million euros independently. “The money was invested by several partners like the province and drilling company NAM,” says Smit. The role of the Economic Board is not only to attract businesses from across the globe to settle in Groningen; due to the earthquakes and economic status of the province, most banks refuse to give loans to aspiring entrepreneurs. The Economic Board has a fund that is willing to give very high risk loans in order to jumpstart the creation of businesses in Groningen. This effort has already led to a rise in economic activity in Groningen. Jobs in construction become available as the cracks and damaged houses needed to be repaired, Google came to the Eemshaven with a large Datacenter and IBM build a major Innovation Center linked to Groningen’s University. In April 2016 Tesla’s owner and director Elon Musk opened up the possibility of a second Tesla car factory in Europe. Many countries and regions, among them Groningen, were quick to respond. Marco Smit is realistic but still thinks Groningen is among the top 10 likely places for the factory. “We have plenty of space to build such a factory, our two seaports (Delfzijl and Eemshaven) supply infrastructure, we are close to big markets like Germany. In the Netherlands Tesla can make profitable tax deals and most importantly for Tesla, we can supply green energy”, says Smit of the province’s chances of attracting the Californian electric car builder. tapwin</a> No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (elonmusk) April 3, 2016 The green vicious cycle Companies like Google and Tesla treasure green and sustainable energy. Harm Post, director of Seaports Groningen, realises this. “We have already built about 700 of the 2,500 windmills we hope to build in the North Sea”, he boasts about the ongoing sustainable projects. “Besides the fact that a lot of trans-Atlantic data cables join in the Eemshaven, our projects to ‘green’ the harbour were one of the main factors that attracted Google to settle in the Eemshaven”. According to Post they are discussing with many undisclosed international companies who are all increasingly interested in using Dutch produced ‘Orange’ green energy. One of the many challenges facing Groningen is the lack of a technically educated workforce. Seaports Groningen and governments have banded together in large projects to re-educate the workforce. “It is about being capable of thinking on a high level. A lawyer could become a process operator in just two years. He just needs to want it”, Post tells. “It’s a vicious cycle. Green energy draws companies, who allow for more investment in green energy and that draws in more companies,” Jeroen Bakker, green energy project manager at the Province of Groningen, tells. Currently 14,2 percent of Groningen’s energy consumption is sustainable, while the Dutch average is 5 percent. Bakker also feels like the earthquakes have literally shaken up politics and public opinion to the point where everybody realises they can’t just rely on gas for their economic future. Until 2014 the NAM extracted about 44 trucks-worth of gas every second. This led to about 80 percent of the total gas reserve being extracted at this point and even with reduced extraction the gas fields won’t last far beyond 2040. If Groningen doesn’t rethink its economy Bakker sees a grim future for the province. Claims that the new economy would lead to more unemployment are total lies according to Bakker. “The gas extraction does not require a huge workforce. Building, maintaining and researching solar panels and windmills does, however, supply jobs for a far larger amount of people. For example: offshore windmills need about one employee per two megawatts, the current 7,000 produced megawatts already supply 3,500 jobs by itself.” The impending super-earthquake There is broad support in local politics, but there is a group of people that thinks all this is useless. “I don’t know how these big companies were persuaded to come to Groningen, but we anticipate a massive earthquake that will render all this progress useless and cause an evacuation of Northern Groningen,” says Pi van Weert from action group Schokkend Groningen. The action group gained prominence during the large demonstrations against the gas extraction and the government’s laid back response to the worries of people in Groningen. Its claims are supported by several engineers, some of them having worked at NAM previously, but their main scientific backer refused to give a statement. All the other sources naturally dismissed the claims of an impending super-earthquake. Until the super earthquake happens, Marco Smit sees only opportunities for Groningen. “Out of the despair and misery caused by the earthquakes came something special. An opportunity for Groningen to become a leading innovator and green energy producer. Something that would previously be unthinkable for an poor, rural and earthquake ridden region.” Article contributed by Alexander Hendriks; main image by Francisca Velasco Share this article: More about: Earthquake Economic Development energy efficiency Page 1 Copy 34 All views Get a different perspective Every story can be told in many ways: see the perspectives from Euronews journalists in our other language teams.

Although no one knows exactly which breaking point is going to fail first, there are now so many candidates for the collapse that an apocalyptic future for humankind is all but guaranteed. Some of the candidates for catastrophic collapse include: Global debt collapse Solar flare taking out the power grid (NASA estimates a 12% chance every 10 years) Social unrest, riots and civil war Ecological collapse as the mass chemical poisoning of the planet reaches an irreversible tipping point Global nuclear war (North Korea, Russia, China, USA, etc.) U.S. government bankruptcy and a collapse of the EBT food stamp system Food supply collapse, including marine ecosystems and ocean fisheries Fukushima radiation explosion if containment pools fail in a subsequent earthquake Nuclear terrorism targeting large cities Cyber war hacking that sends nuclear power facilities all across the country into nuclear meltdowns Russian “mole nukes” tidal wave secret weapon threatening the U.S. East Coast Rise of the machines and an AI war against humanity What will happen with things start to unravel? Mac Slavo at SHTFplan.com nails it when he says: There will be tens of millions of starving, angry and bewildered people who face endangerment and extinction, and there will be a few who succeed not only in planning ahead, but in laying low enough to avoid being noticed and picked off by looters, marauders and misguided authorities. But those who didn’t prepare for the worst when it did happen could very quickly lose everything they have, and many will perish during the next major crisis – which could be triggered at this point by almost anything. How to stay informed for as long as the internet stays up I’m fully aware that everything I’m publishing today will be inaccessible to you once the stuff hits the fan. But until that day comes, you can learn a lot from knowledge published online, but only if you know which websites to visit. To no one’s surprise, all the best websites that teach real preparedness, awakening and human knowledge are systematically suppressed by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other internet totalitarian gatekeepers. This means you need to memorize the web site names in advance — even bookmark them in your browser — so that you can find them even when Google initiates a TOTAL BAN of all “non-official” information (that day is coming, I’ve been told, so get ready). In addition to the usual top-caliber survival websites such as SurvivalBlog.com, ReadyNutrition.com, OffTheGridNews.com and SHTFplan.com, here are five new websites that we’ve launched here at Natural News as part of our editorial expansion into preparedness, survival and “how-to” content: Collapse.news – Covers the details of the collapse at it unfolds, including financial collapse, ecological collapse, social collapse, food collapse and more. Survival.news – Focuses on survival strategies, tactics and how-to articles, including food production, tactical defense, strategic relocation, self-defense, home gardening and more. Bugout.news – A specialty site focusing on how to escape the cities and suburbs during any collapse. This is a popular site because so many people live in the city but don’t want to DIE in the city, y’know? MarketCrash.news – A very new website, with not much content yet, but it will increasingly host articles about the financial collapse, debt collapse, wisdom about buying gold and silver, and so on. Remedies.news – An extremely valuable, lifesaving website that teaches you all about natural remedies, including herbs you can grow at home, plus natural herbal antibiotics that can, in some cases, replace chemical antibiotics. These additional websites bring you lifesaving knowledge on preparedness gear, survival firearms and more In addition to the five primary websites mentioned above, you’ll also find value in these sites which are very narrowly focused on specific survival and preparedness topics: Guns.news – Focuses on firearms know-how, especially for NEW gun owners. Consider this a firearms website for beginners, as it will help you choose and master the best firearms for self-defense, even if you’ve never owned a gun in your life. (You’d be amazed how many people are buying firearms for the first time now, especially across the gay community where gay gun owners are finally arming up and deciding they’re no longer going to just stand there and get shot by radical terrorists who despise gay people.) Outbreak.news – Covers pandemics and disease outbreaks, bringing you the truth about natural remedies that the CDC won’t dare mention (and the FDA deliberately tries to suppress). Gear.news – Still a relatively new site, Gear.news plans to focus on more gear reviews for survival, food production and off-grid living. Here, we plan to bring you more coverage of camp stoves, water filters, navigation gear and more. Watch this site for frequent stories. Iodine.news – This site focuses on iodine, nuclear accidents, Fukushima and nuclear fallout. If you really want to know how to protect yourself from radiation damage, this site is your go-to resource. It also covers cesium-137 and other radioactive isotopes that threaten human health. If you get your (fake) news from CNN and MSNBC, you’re far more likely to DIE when it all comes down There’s no way to say this other than to just state it directly: If you get your news from the fake news media — NYT, WashPo, CNN, etc. — you are far more likely to die in any catastrophic collapse. Why? Because they will deliberately lie about what’s really happening, just like they lied about Fukushima, the Ebola outbreak and the current debt crisis which could implode at any time. The fake news media deliberately exaggerates risks that aren’t real but serve a political purpose — such as the Zika virus hoax or the Russian hacking conspiracy delusion — while downplaying the real risks that actually threaten humankind. Nearly everything reported by the fake news media is the opposite of reality. Only the independent media works hard to tell you the truth about what’s really happening. And while the independent media still makes mistakes — Alex Jones recently broadcast a massive apology for reporting on the PizzaGate story — the “mainstream” media deliberately lies every single day and never apologizes at all. (Natural News never covered the PizzaGate story, by the way, as we could never find enough evidence to support it. Dave Hodges incorrectly stated once that Natural News did cover PizzaGate, but he was accidentally conflating the two sites. It was Alex Jones who covered the story, not Natural News.) In other words, the independent media tries to get the story right, while the mainstream media is always trying to distort reality and LIE to the public for nefarious purposes. The bottom line? Stay informed through the right websites, and you’ll stay alive when it really counts.

More news on bugout Five new websites to bookmark for the coming collapse How to find water in the city after a collapse About the author: Mike Adams (aka the “Health Ranger“) is a best selling author (#1 best selling science book on Amazon.com called “Food Forensics“), an environmental scientist, a patent holder for a cesium radioactive isotope elimination invention, a multiple award winner for outstanding journalism, a science news publisher and influential commentator on topics ranging from science and medicine to culture and politics. Follow his videos, podcasts, websites and science projects at the links below. Mike Adams serves as the founding editor of NaturalNews.com and the lab science director of an internationally accredited (ISO 17025) analytical laboratory known as CWC Labs. There, he was awarded a Certificate of Excellence for achieving extremely high accuracy in the analysis of toxic elements in unknown water samples using ICP-MS instrumentation. Adams is also highly proficient in running liquid chromatography, ion chromatography and mass spectrometry time-of-flight analytical instrumentation. He has also achieved numerous laboratory breakthroughs in the programming of automated liquid handling robots for sample preparation and external standards prep. The U.S. patent office has awarded Mike Adams patent NO. US 9526751 B2 for the invention of “Cesium Eliminator,” a lifesaving invention that removes up to 95% of radioactive cesium from the human digestive tract. Adams has pledged to donate full patent licensing rights to any state or national government that needs to manufacture the product to save human lives in the aftermath of a nuclear accident, disaster, act of war or act of terrorism. He has also stockpiled 10,000 kg of raw material to manufacture Cesium Eliminator in a Texas warehouse, and plans to donate the finished product to help save lives in Texas when the next nuclear event occurs. No independent scientist in the world has done more research on the removal of radioactive elements from the human digestive tract. Adams is a person of color whose ancestors include Africans and American Indians. He is of Native American heritage, which he credits as inspiring his “Health Ranger” passion for protecting life and nature against the destruction caused by chemicals, heavy metals and other forms of pollution. Adams is the founder and publisher of the open source science journal Natural Science Journal, the author of numerous peer-reviewed science papers published by the journal, and the author of the world’s first book that published ICP-MS heavy metals analysis results for foods, dietary supplements, pet food, spices and fast food. The book is entitled Food Forensics and is published by BenBella Books. In his laboratory research, Adams has made numerous food safety breakthroughs such as revealing rice protein products imported from Asia to be contaminated with toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium and tungsten. Adams was the first food science researcher to document high levels of tungsten in superfoods. He also discovered over 11 ppm lead in imported mangosteen powder, and led an industry-wide voluntary agreement to limit heavy metals in rice protein products. In addition to his lab work, Adams is also the (non-paid) executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (CWC), an organization that redirects 100% of its donations receipts to grant programs that teach children and women how to grow their own food or vastly improve their nutrition. Through the non-profit CWC, Adams also launched Nutrition Rescue, a program that donates essential vitamins to people in need. Click here to see some of the CWC success stories.

'More than Google and Facebook': Teachers have 'inadequate' skills in one area EDUCATION.MELB.020822.AFR.PIC BY ERIN JONASSON. GENERIC HOLD FOR FILES. FIRST USE AFR PLEASE. SCHOOL, EDUCTATION, SCHOOL GIRLS IN CLASS, MATHEMATICS, MATHS, CALCULATOR, COMPUTER, STUDY, EDUCATE, LEARN, EXAMS, YEAR 12, HIGH SCHOOL, ***afrphotos.com*** Photo: Erin Johnasson Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Young teachers are entering classrooms with inadequate computer skills, with the NSW Education Minister Rob Stokes calling for improvements in teaching courses at NSW universities. Mr Stokes said graduate teachers should be entering classrooms with a level of "digital literacy" beyond an understanding of email, Google and Facebook. "Parents need to be assured that teachers entering the classroom for the first time are up to the challenge of equipping 21st century students with the technological skills to succeed in an increasingly digital world," he said. "Skills like coding are increasingly sought after across professions and industries." The Digital Literacy Skills and Learning Report, released on Monday, made a number of recommendations to improve the standard of digital literacy - using technology to find information, solve problems and complete tasks - among new teachers, and said: "The digitalisation of the workplace, society and communications cannot be argued." The president of the NSW Council of Deans of Education, Professor Michele Simons, also backed efforts to raise teacher standards. The report, prepared by the NSW Education Standards Authority, said there was "little evidence" that students were required to attain a level of computing skills in line with international practice. The report also said not all young people are tech-savvy: "Exposure to technology cannot be equated with ability to use it." It pointed to an Australian study that found only 15 per cent of the student population were advanced users of information technology, while 45 per cent of students could be described as rudimentary digital technology users. The report said simply providing more computing resources "is not the answer and could in fact be detrimental to student learning". In discussing the standard of computer skills, the report said Norway had revised its national curriculum in 2006 to elevate digital skills as a fundamental competence on par with oral skills, reading, writing, and doing arithmetic. The president of the NSW Teachers' Federation, Maurie Mulheron, said: "We've got to be careful we don't think digital technology in any way can take upon the role of teachers." Mr Mulheron said he was pleased the report mentioned ethical issues surrounding information and communication technology as well as its limitations. "Part of the role of teaching is not just to be compliant users of it," he said. "We know that the IT companies and software companies see education as a massive market and we've got to be very careful we don't as educators become uncritical consumers of the technology."

But can it make it happen? ANA The Association of National Advertisers (ANA) released a statement last week calling on the major social media and digital enterprises to embrace transparency, and submit to independent audits by the Media Rating Council. This isn't the first time the ANA has called for transparency and certainly won't be the last. YouTube and Facebook recently announced they will allow independent audits from the Media Rating Council, a big victory for the ANA and advertisers that have called for more accountability on metrics. This on the heels of Google announcing it will give advertisers more control over where their ads appear; a response no doubt to news of the French advertising company Havas Worldwide pulling its entire ad budget from Google and YouTube in the U.K. due to concerns over its ads running against hateful content. Previously, YouTube and Facebook both reported glitches in its subscriber (for YouTube) and video viewing metrics (for Facebook). The thread leading to this ANA pressure on so-called walled gardens is clear. Marketers want more transparency. “Today, media isn't only seen as a tool to get awareness, it's more seen as a business driver. Because of that, clients want to see their media buys linked to sales… It's imperative that it's transparent,” says Carl Erik Kjaersgaard, founder and CEO at the media agency Blackwood Seven. As a collective of some 600 companies and more than 10,000 brands, the ANA represents a sizable sample of the advertising market. However, the ANA could be limited in making definitive demands of those walled gardens, as its membership organizations may have different thresholds on what they will allow. “There will come pressure from the market where they have to be more transparent,” Kjaersgaard says. “I don't think clients will move all of their money from those [walled gardens], but they will look at more options.” Now, those options could be more transparent media networks like Kjaersgaard's company, or a more extreme approach, like Procter & Gamble's, which recently announced it will no longer pay for digital media that doesn't adhere to its standards for fraud and viewability transparency. In any event, marketers are showing their impatience with companies like Facebook and Google, and are demonstrating their need for more transparency. “While walled gardens create safe and trusted environments for consumers, marketers' ability to combine insights from open and closed environments simply compounds downward trending numbers,” says Lewis Gersh, CEO at the programmatic direct mail company PebblePost. “[It's a] classic ‘the emperor has no clothes' situation. The more interesting question is ‘Why is everyone imagining what he might be wearing at this point?' What we should focus on are the core issues around how marketers and consumers interact.” Previous Post One on One Louis Rosenberg on the Merits of Swarm Intelligence, the Other A.I.

More videos Uber driverless car crashes in Arizona Uber suspends its pilot program for driverless cars after a vehicle equipped with the technology crashed in Arizona. The accident once again raises questions about the safety of autonomous driving technology and how it will interact with other drivers on the road. There was a person behind the wheel at the time of the Friday's accident, but an Uber spokeswoman said the vehicle was in self-driving mode and that there were no backseat riders. The company's self-driving fleet has been taken off the roads in Arizona pending the investigation. The company also suspended test vehicles in Pittsburgh, where its autonomous cars also pick up passengers, and San Francisco, where it does not. Uber has been moving aggressively to put its self-driving vehicles on the road with passengers in the backseat. As a precaution, the vehicles have a safety engineer who can take control if necessary. Others that have been developing the technology longer, including Waymo, Google's self-driving car company, have been hesitant to put ordinary people in their cars without further testing. Related Content Google's Waymo accuses Uber of stealing self-driving car tech Uber explands its self-driving cars Many expect self-driving vehicles will enter the market through ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft. Those services tend to be more popular in urban environments, where autonomous cars will be most useful, and they've already conditioned users to put their safety and trust in the hands of relative strangers. The crash comes as Uber grapples with a wide range of crises. Among them, several Uber employees have been accused of stealing intellectual property from Waymo and using it as the basis for Uber's self-driving technology. The outcome of that legal fight could affect Uber's future significantly. Advertisement Automobile and technology companies alike are dumping billions of dollars into the technology with the idea that one day our cars will no longer need human drivers. But that future is still far off. In the meantime, vehicles equipped with self-driving capabilities will share the road with human motorists. That will put autonomous vehicles in situations that may seem simple but are actually difficult to navigate, such as what to do when another vehicle honks its horn. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Uber has been moving aggressively to put its self-driving vehicles on the road with passengers in the backseat.  It also remains unclear to what extent self-driving cars will be regulated by federal and state governments. Last year, the Transportation Department released a policy paper outlining 15 guidelines for developers of self-driving cars. In states across the country, legislators are debating how to allow the vehicles to be tested on functioning streets without endangering passengers and other drivers. It's a push and pull between freewheeling innovation and regulatory oversight that many new technologies endure, but the stakes may be heightened when lives are at stake. Indeed, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have already begun debate about public tolerance for injuries and deaths as a result of self-driving cars. More than 35,000 people in the United States were killed in motor vehicle accidents in 2015, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The majority of those are the result of human error, and technology enthusiasts believe that number will be reduced significantly as more self-driving vehicles get on the road. Industry observers expect media coverage of and officials' response to crashes involving self-driving vehicles will shape public perception of their safety. A fatal car collision involving a Tesla Model S received widespread attention because the vehicle was in autopilot mode at the time, though a government investigation later found there were no defects in the software. Arizona is one of a growing number of states that allow self-driving vehicles to be tested on public roads. Its permitting requirements are also more lenient than in neighbouring California, which previously barred Uber from its roads for failing to obtain the proper permits.

According to AOL News, the Flip or Flop star shared several pictures of herself wearing a bikini this week on Instagram. Initially, it was the fact that her daughter, Taylor, was in some of the photos that she shared that attracted so much attention. Christina El Moussa [Image by Jerod Harris/Getty Images] The photoshoot featured Christina El Moussa and her 6-year-old daughter wearing matching two-piece purple bathing suits. Both Christina and her daughter were flashing big smiles. Taylor’s smile was extra wide because she was enjoying a donut during the photoshoot. Christina, on the other hand, was holding her new French bulldog puppy. Welcome to the family!! @cashiethefrenchbulldog ???? Click link in my bio!! ???????? A post shared by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on Mar 23, 2017 at 12:01pm PDT What Christina likely thought was a fun photoshoot for her and her daughter quickly got slammed by mommy-shamers and celebrity-watchers as “completely inappropriate.” Fox News noted that one viewer of the show said they would no longer be watching the show because Christina was not making good choices as a mother. In three days, the picture featuring Christina and her daughter in matching bikinis acquired 43,000 likes and nearly 3,000 comments. While media outlets claim the initial reaction to the Flip or Flop bikini photos was very negative and filled with mommy-shamers – it appears as if the commenters on the picture are now singing a different tune.

A post shared by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on Mar 26, 2017 at 8:59am PDT “Can someone explain why this is inappropriate?” one Instagram user questions. “I don’t see anything wrong with any of these bikini pictures,” a second Instagram user exclaimed. There are several recent comments telling Christina to just ignore the haters as they are just “jealous” of the gorgeous bikini pictures. There are, however, still a trickle of negative mommy-shamers leaving comments on the picture. “No modesty at all. This is what you’re teaching your daughter?” The Flip or Flop star is also currently trending on Google and social media because of an Instagram account she made exclusively for her new family bulldog, Cash. In one of the pictures, which can be viewed directly on Instagram, Christina can be seen holding her French bulldog up and giving Cash a kiss. AOL News notes the Flip or Flop star managed to flash a hint of side boob in the photo she shared on her new dog’s Instagram page. In the comments of this particular photo, Christina has been hit with a pretty even mixture of people complementing her for her hot body, and body-shamming her for being “too skinny.” Love my mama ????@christinaelmoussa A post shared by Cash The Frenchie (@cashiethefrenchbulldog) on Mar 21, 2017 at 8:37am PDT People notes that the Flip or Flop star didn’t take too kindly to the mommy and body-shamers on her Instagram pictures of her and her daughter in bikinis. El Moussa fired back at those who shamed her photos as inappropriate and gave her unwanted parenting advice. A day ago, Christina shared a photo of Taylor’s first slumber party. Our first slumber party!! … 6 kids, a dog and 2 moms. So fun, crazy, but so fun … @caraclarknutrition … love you always ❤️???????? *sorry just realized kids in swimwear again.. it's cali people it's what we do* A post shared by Christina El Moussa (@christinaelmoussa) on Mar 24, 2017 at 9:02pm PDT In the caption of the photo, Christina revealed there were six kids, a dog, and two mothers. Unfortunately for Christina, mommy-shamers were not too happy with her 19-month-old Brayden James standing so close to the pool. In the comments on the photo, it does not appear as if people are very happy to see Taylor and her friends in bikinis calling it indecent and inappropriate. The mommy-shamers claim Christina is sending the wrong message to Taylor, Brayden, and the other children at the party. “No one is a hater, but as a mother it is scary to have a toddler being that close to a pool!” one user pointed out on picture above. The Flip or Flop star decided that she had enough of the mommy-shamers this week, and decided to fire back. “OMG 1. It’s a beach entry if he fell in it’s only a foot high, he would be ok 2. It’s not his first time in or around the pool, but thanks for your “concern” aka judgment. 3. AND most importantly I am right there and could be to him in 3 seconds SMH at this!!!!” What do you think about all of the attention Christina El Moussa has been getting on social media lately regarding her bikini pictures with her daughter?

Ross Posted 22 Mar 2017 | 12:00 GMT Photo: Baidu Robocar technology has received perhaps the most honest compliment mankind can bestow: Hackers tried to steal it. Even more extraordinary was the willingness of the targeted company, China’s Baidu, to acknowledge the attempted heist. "It's very difficult to know who employs them to do that, but we know someone tried to hire someone in the underground market to steal from us," said Ma Jie, the cybersecurity chief of the Beijing-based company, in an interview with Bloomberg. He wouldn’t or couldn’t give further details. But there are plenty of suspects with the money needed for black-hat operations, including world-bestriding companies flush with cash. Not one has been found guilty in a court of law, but accusations have begun flying: Last month, Waymo, the spinoff of Google’s robocar project, accused a former employee of stealing megabytes’ worth of its data and for a rival operation at Uber. Uber denies any wrongdoing. Baidu followed in the footsteps of Google by turning a specialty in search into a subspecialty in autonomous cars. Like most robocar outfits, it is testing the technology in California and forming partnerships with auto makers and tech firms. Among Baidu’s recent deals are its investment seven months ago in Velodyne, the lidar company; its collaboration with BMW; and its partnership with Nvidia, developer of a system-on-a-chip for robocars. Baidu has demonstrated partially robotic cars, and it’s talking up a ride-hailing robotaxi service as early as next year and a rollout of truly self-driving cars in 2021. In this, too, it is very much in line with the industry, which is offering an ambitious, although increasingly divergent, timeline for the new technology.  Earlier this month, at a conference in Germany, Volvo, Audi, Ford and BMW estimated they’d have cars that could drive themselves with human supervision by 2021. Nvidia said that it would be able to do that this year, and be able to field a totally self-driving car by 2025. Bosch was more pessimistic, saying that full autonomy might take several years longer to achieve.  With all these companies competing for skills that take years to develop, the price of engineering talent has soared. And it’s no wonder that the temptation to steal those engineers’ work has also increased.

Wednesday, March 29, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Archive thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Technology  Tech world debate on robots and jobs heats up March 27, 2017, Monday Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics are heightening concerns about automation replacing a growing number of occupations. AFP Photo WASHINGTON: Are robots coming for your job? Although technology has long affected the labor force, recent advances in artificial intelligence and robotics are heightening concerns about automation replacing a growing number of occupations, including highly skilled or “knowledge-based” jobs. Just a few examples: self-driving technology may eliminate the need for taxi, Uber and truck drivers, algorithms are playing a growing role in journalism, robots are informing consumers as mall greeters, and medicine is adapting robotic surgery and artificial intelligence to detect cancer and heart conditions. Of 700 occupations in the United States, 47 percent are at “high risk” from automation, an Oxford University study concluded in 2013. A McKinsey study released this year offered a similar view, saying “about half” of activities in the world’s workforce “could potentially be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies.” Still, McKinsey researchers offered a caveat, saying that only around five percent of jobs can be “fully automated.” Another report, by PwC this month, concluded that around a third of jobs in the United States, Germany and Britain could be eliminated by automation by the early 2030s, with the losses concentrated in transportation and storage, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade. But experts warn that such studies may fail to grasp the full extent of the risks to the working population. “The studies are underestimating the impact of technology — some 80 to 90 percent of jobs will be eliminated in the next 10 to 15 years,” said Vivek Wadhwa, a tech entrepreneur and faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley. – Dire consequences – “Artificial intelligence is moving a lot faster than anyone had expected,” said Wadhwa, who is co-author of a forthcoming book on the topic. “Alexa (Amazon’s home hub) and Google Home are getting amazingly intelligent very fast. Microsoft and Google have demonstrated that AI can understand human speech better than humans can.” Wadhwa calls the driverless car a “metaphor” for the future of labor and a sign of a major shift. Warnings of dire social consequences from automation have also come from the likes of the physicist Stephen Hawking and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, among others. Hebrew University of Jerusalem historian Yuval Harari writes in his 2017 book, “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow” that technology will lead to “superfluous people” as “intelligent non-conscious algorithms” improve. “As algorithms push humans out of the job market,” he writes, “wealth and power might become concentrated in the hands of the tiny elite that owns the all-powerful algorithms, creating unprecedented social and political inequality.” Harari points to the Oxford study, estimating a high probability of job loss to automation — cashiers (97 percent), paralegals (94 percent), bakers (89 percent) and bartenders (77 percent), for example. Others disagree. Boston University economist and researcher James Bessen dismisses alarmist predictions, contending that advances in technology generally lead to more jobs, even if the nature of work changes. His research found that the proliferation of ATM machines did not decrease bank tellers’ employment in recent decades, and that automation of textile mills in the 19th century led to an increase in weaving jobs because it created more demand. “Robots can replace humans in certain tasks but don’t entirely replace humans,” he said. But he acknowledged that automation “is destroying a lot of low-skill, low wage jobs, and the new jobs being created need higher skills.” Former president Barack Obama’s council of economic advisors also warned last year that most jobs paying less than $20 an hour “would come under pressure from automation.” – ‘Tax the robot’ – Although the net impact of robots remains unclear, tech leaders and others are already debating how to deal with the potential job displacement. Microsoft founder Bill Gates said last month that he supports a “robot tax,” an idea floated in Europe, including by a socialist presidential candidate in France. But Bessen, a former fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center, said taxing robots could be counterproductive. “You don’t want to be taxing the machines because they enable people to earn higher wages,” he said. “If you tax machines, you will slow the beneficial side of the process.” Peter Diamandis, chairman of the X Prize Foundation for technical innovation and founder of the Silicon Valley think-tank Singularity University, is among those calling for a “universal basic income” to compensate people for job losses. Offering income guarantees “will be one of many tools empowering self-actualization at scale,” he said in a blog post, arguing that automation will allow people “to follow their passions, be more creative.” But Wadhwa says the problems run deeper and will require more creative solutions. “A basic income won’t solve the social problems of joblessness because people’s identity revolves around our jobs,” he said. “Even if we have enough food and energy, we have to deal with the social disruption that’s coming. We need a much broader discussion.” Bessen says reversing the trends of the past decades, where high-skilled jobs gain at the expense of others, pose a “big challenge.” “It’s entirely possible we can meet the challenge,” he said. “But the evidence in the past 20 years is that things are moving in the wrong direction.” – AFP What do you think of this story?

In the settings, we can see that Samsung hasn’t changed much compared to the Galaxy S7 on Android Nougat, but it definitely seems like the launcher has been revamped and, of course, there are the on-screen buttons with their unique design. These images also reveal some new details regarding the camera, one of which is the quick access shortcut by pressing the power button twice. We’ve seen this before on Google’s devices, but it makes sense that Samsung would implement this same method given the fact that the home button has been removed. In the camera UI, we also get a glimpse at the yellow Bixby button which was previously reported on. Apparently, that button will enable Samsung’s digital assistant to identify objects in the real world, similar to Amazon’s Fire Phone. Along with that, we also get a new video from China showing off a dummy unit of the Galaxy S8 next to the Galaxy S7 Edge and iPhone 7, and the Galaxy S8+ up against Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. Lastly, we have the mother of all S8 leaks from WinFuture. The outlet has previously revealed some information about the phone, but in its latest report, it has surfaced several new press images of the device in multiple colors, as well as confirming some specifications and more. First, let’s take a look at some of these new images. As you can see below, these new images show us the phone in the previously leaked blue color, as well as showing off some new angles of the black, silver, and orchid gray colors, the latter of which also features a slight purple tint on the metal frame. The article further details some of the specifications for the upcoming device. First, we get further confirmation on the 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch displays on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus respectively, as well as the 2960×1440 resolution. Samsung’s 12MP rear camera is also confirmed with OIS, f/1.7 aperture, phase detection, and laser autofocus as well. On the front, there will be an 8MP sensor which has the same f/1.7 aperture, with the addition of an iris scanner alongside it. Another image shows off that scanner in action, and this time it appears to be in full-color versus the black and white version which debuted in the Galaxy Note 7. Of course, the Galaxy S8 will also be IP68 rated against water and dust, with 64GB of storage in the European model and a microSD card slot as well. The European model will also apparently be powered by Samsung’s in-house Exynos 8895 octa-core chipset with other models being powered by the Snapdragon 835. Samsung is also packing a 3,000 mAh battery into the S8 and a 3,500 mAh battery in the S8+ with the phones coming in at about 8mm in thickness with the smaller S8 weighing in at 151 grams. Both phones will also offer USB-C and a headphone jack. Lastly, the article goes over a new program from Samsung called “Guard S8.” This appears to be a protection plan for the Galaxy S8 which offers up a one-time screen replacement and “remote support” similar to that of what Google offers on the Pixel. It’s unclear if this will be included with the phone, or if it will be an add-on like AppleCare.

X Seen & Heard: What the Sunday papers reported O’Reilly’s Providence shares, Government’s Apple briefings and Brandtone liquidation Sun, Mar 26, 2017, 19:09 Sir Anthony O’Reilly: Last shares in Providence will be sold as part of bankruptcy process. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons         Last O’Reilly’s shares to be sold The last shares held by Sir Anthony O’Reilly in Providence Resources, the company he founded, will shortly be sold as part of his ongoing bankruptcy process, the Sunday Business Post reports. A US filing in relation to the bankruptcy in the Bahamas also points to ongoing investigation into the former media baron’s extensive art collection. Taoiseach briefed Google on Apple ruling Both Google and Facebook were briefed on the implications of the Apple ax ruling by Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Minister for Finance Michael Noonan respectively, the Sunday Independent writes. Google global head of public policy sought a briefing from Mr Kenny on a visit to the State, while Mr Noonan briefed senior Facebook officials during a visit to the United States, documents obtained under Freedom of Information show. Mercury Engineering up for sale The Sunday Independent also reports that the privately held Mercury Engineering, one of the largest engineering businesses in the State, is on the block. The business founded in 1972 by Joe Morgan and Frank O’Kane has annual revenues of about €500 million and employs more than 3,000 people worldwide. Brandtone goes into liquidation Brandtone, a mobile marketing group that raised €41 million from investors, including Unilever, and which won the EY Entrepreneur of the Year award for emerging companies in 2015, has gone into liquidation, according to the Sunday Times. The company went into examinership earlier this month but failed to find necessary funding to survive following a dispute with Accenture of a €1.7 million payment. Version 1 in talks with Volpi Capital The Sunday Times also reports that shareholders in fast-growing IT group Version 1 are in advanced talks to sell a large majority stake to UK private equity group Volpi Capital, which is led by Irishman Crevan O’Grady. Founder Justin Keatinge, who is reported to hold 43 per cent of the equity and recently stepped down from his active role in the business, would be the big winner from any takeover. ADVERTISEMENT Ballymore to sue CRH Developer Sean Mulryan’s Ballymore group is to pursue a court action against CRH and its subsidiary Roadstone among others over the alleged supply of pyrite in material used in a high-end housing scheme in Portmarnock, the Sunday Independent reports. More than 90 of the 145 houses in the Drumnigh Wood estate are affected, it is claimed. The case is listed for May 30th. Nama could have made extra €18bn A new report says Nama would have made an additional €18 billion had it held on to and managed its assets. The report by economist Jim Power using numbers validated by Lisney says overseas funds made spectacular profits of more than €317 million in under two years on just 11 deals by “flipping” property assets acquired from Nama at an average return of 47 per cent, the Sunday Business Post reports.       Topics: Anthony O Reilly Crevan O Grady Enda Kenny Taoiseach Frank O Kane Jim Power Joe Morgan Justin Keatinge Michael Noonan National Asset Management Agency Facebook Google Mercury Engineering Providence Resources Roadstone Sean Mulryan Volpi Capital Bahamas Portmarnock Read More Newstalk scores Eir sponsorship for “Off the Ball” Second INM whistleblower made disclosure over Newstalk row Sky reaches for the stars - and drops into Dublin ‘Adapt or die’ time for RTÉ, but what does its future look like?

Search Politics Boris Johnson: It’s ‘disgusting’ that tech companies can make money from extremism The Foreign Secretary criticised tech companies for not removing extremist material fast enough (Photo: PA) Chris Green 2 days Sunday March 26th 2017 Boris Johnson has launched a furious attack on Google and other large internet companies for refusing to take down extremist material from the web. The Foreign Secretary said it was “disgusting” that technology firms could make money by running advertisements alongside extremist videos. “It’s disgusting. They need to stop just making money out of prurient violent material” Boris Johnson Mr Johnson also accused the companies of failing to remove terrorist propaganda and training manuals when they were tipped off by the security services. “It’s time for the internet providers, the social media companies, to take this stuff off the web,” he told the Sunday Times. “We want the companies concerned to show some responsibility. I don’t think they have been. They need to develop new systems and algorithms to detect this stuff and remove it. They are not acting when they are tipped off.” YouTube row Google has been forced to act after it emerged that extremist content uploaded to its video-sharing website YouTube was playing alongside adverts paid for by large brands. The row has resulted in big companies including Volkswagen, Toyota, Tesco and Marks and Spencer suspending their YouTube adverts as Google scrambles to rewrite its advertising policies. “I’m furious about it,” Mr Johnson said. “It’s disgusting. They need to stop just making money out of prurient violent material.” Asked if the companies could be seen as aiding and abetting terrorism by failing to rapidly remove the material, he replied: “Evil flourishes when good men do nothing and that’s what’s happening here. They are putting up adverts next to it.” Information on how to mount a terror attack – including a tutorial on how to stab someone most effectively – was found to be easily accessible online in the wake of last week’s Westminster attack. Google has promised to take a “tougher stance” on hateful content and said it would be hiring “significant numbers of people” to enforce its policies. iNews https://inews.co.uk Get daily news updates Subscribe to the newsletter Sign up today The i's Essential Daily Briefing We know that sometimes it’s easier for us to come to you with the news.

Blog Contact Us   Google rolls out Maps feature Posted on March 23, 2017   Search giant Google has officially launched a new feature for its Maps service that allows a user to temporarily send their location to another user. To gain access to this feature, users will need to set it up and recipients will also need to have done the same. Once the user is ready to go, they simply tap on the blue dot, which indicates where that user is on the map. Alternatively, users can also access the tool in the side menu of the app and select ‘Get Started’. Next, users will select the option ‘Share Location’ and then choose any number of available contacts to share the location with. Furthermore, there is the option to choose how long a user wants to share the location for, which can be anywhere from minutes to months. The tool allows users to select a “special friend” for when they want to share their location over a longer period, by selecting “on-going basis”. As well as this, the new feature will also allow the user to send locations to those who do not have Maps. This is done by sending the selected recipient a short link via an SMS message. With privacy being a big concern to some people, the company aims to remind people that they have this location sharing service switched on. The company has said that the app will send a notification to the user every two to three weeks informing them that this function has been left on. This is the latest of a string of updates to Maps to make it much more useful to people in their everyday lives. Last month, Google updated the tool to allow users to mark certain locations and save them for later. This is aimed at various people, such as those making social plans with friends who may want to save the location of a particular bar or restaurant, or people who have recently relocated to a new city and want to remember where a particular venue is and how to get there. Maps has also introduced a feature aimed at drivers relating to finding a car parking space at their final destination. It allows the user to see what the parking situation is like in real time and whether they need to find somewhere else to park, perhaps prompting a user to designate more time to travel. The location-sharing update is now live on all versions of Google Maps – Android, iOS and desktop version.

I’d love to say it was love at first sight, but it would be more accurate to say lust at first Google. Here’s how it happened. My producer kindly let me stay in his flat while he was away. I received an email to say that Dan, an American he knew from LA, was travelling to London on business and needed a place to stay and would it be OK if he stayed in the spare room? “Boo-hoo, can’t he get a hotel?” I huffed as I Googled him. “He’s probably some lonely old man and I’m going to have to have awkward conversations with him outside the bathroom. What if he’s creepy?” I scrolled through an image search and soon began to realise that if anything, I was the creepy one. He was hot. Curly dark hair. Dimples. Great arms. “He can stay,” I emailed back far too quickly and continued to search. It was then that I struck gold. The hotty coming to stay in my flat was a world champion competitive air guitarist. A bit of background. My 20s had been, I think it’s fair to say, romantically experimental. I came out of a six-year relationship at the age of 25 and went on to date a string of useless, depressed, egotistical boy-men, predominantly quasi-employed actors and comedians. I really knew how to pick them. I then fell in love with a scientist, only to discover he was having an affair and I was the other woman. On the rebound from that, I had strung along some poor sod for months just because I really liked his choice of restaurants. I even convinced myself that I might be able to marry him. Then things calmed down. It went quiet. Silent, almost. At this point I became certain I was gay. Tried being gay. Was not gay. Then became convinced I must have overlooked someone, so doubled back on myself and rekindled with an ex. Had not overlooked someone. Had been right the first time. When I first saw my husband in real life, my first thought was: “Bit short.” My second thought was: “I would like to eat your face.” And my third thought was: “What’s the other guy doing here?” My producer-landlord was back in town, which meant he was staying in a hotel while I stayed in his flat with his fit friend Dan. The three of us went for dinner and I subtly attempted to gather intel about Dan’s relationship status. He was divorced. Intriguing. I had to bite my tongue. It is not polite to ask a man you barely know why he got divorced. I ascertained that he was single but I still had so many questions. “So many questions!” I blurted in a high-pitched squeal as I flicked my hair off my shoulders, something the congregation at our wedding were told was the moment it became fairly apparent I was attracted to him. The two of us walked back to the flat. “Your place or mine?” I joked on the way home. If we weren’t married, it’s the sort of thing that I would cringe myself to sleep about every night. Dan went to bed in the spare room and I lay awake next door plotting ways to hang out with him socially without seeming desperate. I casually invited him to a comedy gig I was going to with my sister-in-law. I texted her. “He’s an air guitarist.” “Oh, he’ll know Dan Crane then,” she replied. “He is Dan Crane.” With this, she sent me a picture of the two of them when they had worked together five years ago on a commercial shoot in South Africa. My new in-laws have a Yiddish word for this romantic coincidence – they call it bashert, which I think roughly translates in Yorkshire to “a reet small world”. At the gig, I noticed that Dan was a big laugher and I couldn’t take my eyes off him. We all got drunk and he wanted to go somewhere to dance. His air-guitar moves were very much my jam. The stranger who came to stay in my spare room did not stay in the spare room for long. It was a whirlwind few days and I thought it might just be a fling but a few weeks later, I thought I’d play it cool and … fly across the Atlantic for a second date. This is the problem with initiating a relationship with a man who lives 5,000 miles away. At some point, one of you will have to disembark from a 10-hour flight with matted hair and the whiff of plane farts still on your skin and wheel an enormous suitcase towards a near-stranger, which doesn’t exactly scream: “I can take it or leave it.” We leapt straight into a long-distance relationship and miraculously, we managed to stay together despite time-zone differences, mounting air fares and extreme carbon footprint remorse. Eighteen months later, we were engaged and lots of people liked to nod earnestly at the news and tell me that of course when you meet the man you want to marry, “you just know”. What I would like to say about that is: it is absolute bullshit. I didn’t know at all, and neither did he. Marriage is basically a dare. We hope. It is an adventure. It was an insane act of blind faith when I got on that plane. As our entire relationship has proved, anything can happen. You just never know what’s going to show up on your doorstep.

Source: Shutterstock In mid-February, BIDU looked to be on the upswing, but the firm’s fourth-quarter earnings dealt a heavy blow to Baidu stock. With BIDU shares down nearly 10% from where they were a month ago, however, this dip could translate into a buying opportunity. Baidu Earnings It’s true that Baidu reported less-than-stellar earnings last month. The company’s quarterly revenue came in a $2.6 billion, which represents a decline of more than 2% from last year’s figures. Even more concerning was the fact that online marketing customers declined 18.6% in 2016. For investors that consider BIDU to be the Chinese Google, that’s a huge deal. Advertising dollars are everything to search engines like Baidu and Google. It’s Not as Bad as It Looks Those figures are certainly scary, but when you look at the reason behind them things start to look a little bit rosier. It’s important to note that BIDU faced some major headwinds last year, including a big change to China’s advertising regulations. The cost to comply with the new rules was significant for Baidu, which generates around 96% of its revenue from advertising. Not only did the new regulations hit BIDU’s revenue hard, but they also hurt the firm’s customers numbers. The new regulations include strict rules regarding how companies advertise and some of Baidu’s current customers weren’t able to meet those requirements, which resulted in a loss. However, there could be a silver lining in there for BIDU as the new requirements will help the firm identify who its quality customers are.

A routine win for England against limited opposition. Jermain Defoe scored on his return to the side, and Jamie Vardy continued his return to form with the second. Both were accomplished finishes. It was the kind of forgettable stroll we see so often in international football these days, and puts England one step closer to Russia. Thanks for your company; bye!

Then as now, utterly unfathomable.” Yes, especially for somebody as conservative as Eriksson. And wasn’t Walcott one of only four strikers, a half-fit Rooney and a barely fit Owen being two of the others? Bizarre. What an almighty mess England made of that tournament.

The keeper comes out and Vardy lofts the ball over him and the bar. He should have scored. It was a great run though, possibly aided by the state of his eyebrows. Vardy loft the keeper, but it goes over.

England 2-0 Lithuania (Vardy 66) Jamie Vardy seals victory for England. It was another nicely taken goal. Walker fed a short angled ball into Lallana, who clipped it first time round the corner. Slavickas pushed up for offside without bothering to consult anybody else, which gave Vardy space and time to control the ball and sidefoot smoothly into the corner. I think those were his first touches of the game. Vardy scores number two for England. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters And celebrates.

It’s not really a natural corridor in the way that the wicket is, in that people don’t tend to move along that line between goalkeeper and rear-most defenders. Surely there is something more appropriate for that area. How about playing the ball along the precipice of doubt? Or between the defender’s two minds?” Updated at 1.21pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.20pm EDT 13:20 60 min A double England change: Marcus Rashford and Jamie Vardy replace Raheem Sterling and Jermain Defoe, the scorer of the only goal.

We heard more of the company's vision for Amazon's digital assistant during a trip to its HQ in Korea. Alexa has a body and a face now, and she looks a lot like Eve from the movie WALL-E. In a meeting at LG's Seoul headquarters, we got a closer look at LG's upcoming robot home hub, which could be the center of an Alexa-enabled home when it comes out, hopefully next year. LG is preparing two robot SmartThinq hubs (pronounced "Smart Thin Q," by the way), and while it's still figuring out functionality, they'll both hook into new LG appliances and third-party electronics with Alexa, according to product sales manager Wez Sookyum Kim. "The mother and daughter hubs, they share the same features and the same functionality," Kim said. "The one with the bigger screen can watch movies and videos. The smaller one, you would take to your office or on a picnic." The hubs have cameras above their screens, potentially for face tracking and face recognition, and they "dance" by wiggling around adorably when you play music. A post shared by Sascha Segan (@saschasegan) on Mar 22, 2017 at 11:12am PDT Why a robot and not just a speaker, or—like Samsung's SmartThings hub—a box? Kim said the bot form was "more interactive," something you're more likely to talk to and relate to. I don't usually see products from major manufacturers this early in their development, and Kim was pretty open about the potential features they're trying out. The small hub/speaker will have a battery pack and either its own 4G module, or it will connect to your phone via Bluetooth. The larger one is designed to sit in your home, and it'll have Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth to connect your gadgets. "We're still in the early stage of concept planning; things could change!" Kim said. The hubs currently run Android, but LG isn't married to any particular OS platform. "We've had meetings with Google. Even [LG's own] webOS is an option for us down the road," Kim said. "At IFA we had the Windows refrigerator, and at CES we had the webOS refrigerator." Alexa vs. Bixby? LG's flagship G6 phone uses the Google Assistant, not Alexa, so LG has clearly left a door open to using Google as a primary partner. But LG's Alexa partnership gives it an easy way to hook together its home appliances with the most popular third-party smart home brands, which generally have existing Alexa skills. Kim confirmed that LG has "a bit of privileged" access to the Alexa service, which could give it abilities beyond most third-party skill builders. So while LG has its own sensors, smart bulbs, and motion sensors, Alexa lets it connect with brands that are more popular in the US, like Philips and Honeywell. "It's relatively difficult to penetrate the [smart home] market in the US," because of existing big brands, Kim said. LG's open approach is a counter to Samsung's Bixby voice control system, which Samsung CTO Injong Rhee said will appear on Samsung devices first. This year, all of LG's higher-end home appliances will be Wi-Fi-enabled, reps said. The company is focusing on making its smart home gadgets easier to set up and connect to each other, with deeper AI features coming a few years down the road. Related Can Samsung's Bixby Smash Alexa? Can Samsung's Bixby Smash Alexa? AI is coming first to LG's robotic vacuum cleaner, which is learning to avoid objects in a room. I kicked back with a few LG reps and speculated about what it could do in their other product lines. For washing machines and dishwashers, it could monitor electric rates during the day and make sure to do your wash when power was cheapest, for instance. "Saving money is a huge reason to adopt smart appliances," LG spokesman Ken Hong said. By 2020, your fridge could analyze what's inside it, cross reference that with online receipes, and download a recipe program to your oven. "Everyone in this industry is trying to figure out what people really want. The one who gets it properly will be successful," Kim said. Back to top Previous : Can Samsung's Bixby Smash Alexa?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Security Critical LastPass Security Flaws Could Have Allowed Hackers to Steal User Passwords By Rafia Shaikh Mar 22, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Reports earlier this year had revealed how password managers can easily leak user data. A fresh report from Google researcher Tavis Ormandy further confirms that like any other software, password management tools are also vulnerable to flaws and security attacks. Ormandy disclosed a critical vulnerability in LastPass that could have allowed attackers to steal user passwords. LastPass could have been leaking your passwords Ormandy reported the vulnerability on Monday that affected Chrome and Firefox extensions of the popular password management tool. He warned that these add-ons could be used to steal user passwords. Later on, he said that he had identified another vulnerability that can be exploited to steal passwords for any domain. Related Cross-Platform Password Manager ‘LastPass’ Is Now Available For Free Security researchers explained that the extension coding flaws allowed anyone to “proxy” unauthenticated messages to a LastPass browser extension. An attacker could gain access to privileged LastPass commands, including the ability to copy passwords. In a blog post published today, LastPass explained that the issue was related to an experimental feature. While Ormandy has disclosed over three vulnerabilities, LastPass said they are “largely the same”. The company has now patched the flaws and added that updates would be automatically installed for all users. On the night of March 20th, we received a report of an issue in our Chrome 4.1.42.80 extension. We immediately investigated and released a server-side workaround within a few hours. The exploit applied to all LastPass clients – Chrome, Firefox, Edge – in which an experimental user onboarding feature was released. Following this, Ormandy reported that the bug also affects Firefox. “This vulnerability is largely the same as the one reported the prior day, and affecting the 4.x Firefox addon,” LastPass said.

Related US Cybersecurity Is a “National Disgrace” – Both Parties Have Only Paid Lip Service — LastPass (@LastPass) March 22, 2017 The company has now also issued a fix with an update sent earlier today to address the Firefox issue. LastPass said that their investigation has not indicated if any sensitive user data was lost or compromised. Hence, no master password change or a site credential password change is required, the company added. “We have no indication that any of the reported vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild, but we’re doing a thorough review at this time to confirm,” the company wrote. “We will soon provide a more comprehensive summary of the events and what our community needs to know.” Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Related Attackers Launched a Safari Scareware Campaign to Extort Users Watching Porn 6 days ago 11 UK Wants WhatsApp Backdoors – Needs Help From Those Who “Understand the Necessary Hashtags” Mar 27, 2017 13 Microsoft Pulls Docs.com Search After It Exposed Sensitive Files, Including Investment Portfolios & Password Lists Mar 26, 2017 15 Ajit Pai Hits User Privacy – U.S. Senate Votes to Roll Back FCC’s Privacy Protections Mar 23, 2017 18 CIA Has Been Infecting iPhones Since 2008 – New “Dark Matter” Documents Reveal Mar 23, 2017 17 US Accuses North Korea of $81 Million Bangladesh Theft – Sanctions Against Chinese Middlemen Expected Mar 23, 2017 10 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Maybe you’re studying it in college, or you’ve just started at an entry-level position after attending a five-week coding boot camp. You’re writing a function in C or Python or Javascript or whatever language you prefer. For some reason, the code isn’t compiling or it hits a snag at line 281 and the terminal outputs some arcane gibberish like “AttributeError: ‘foo’ object has no attribute ‘bar’.” So what do you do next? You could double-check and see if you missed adding a semicolon at the end of a line. You could perform the classic occult coding ritual of running the script a few more times and hoping that it’ll just work. You could give up entirely and pour yourself a drink. Or maybe you do what is now the standard troubleshooting method across the profession: You paste the error message into Google and search for it, crossing your fingers in hopes that a website called “Stack Overflow” will come up in the results. Named for a common computing error (in which memory used in a section of the computer’s storage known as the “call stack” exceeds its allocated capacity) (no need to thank me for explaining), Stack Overflow is a Q&A forum aimed primarily at coders. That means most of its threads are devoted to someone saying “I’m encountering error such and such” or “Can anyone figure out the best way to perform such-and-such function?” “I taught myself to code in the pre-boot-camp era,” Steve Harms, the head of curriculum at Dev Bootcamp, told me, “and the way I would get around getting stuck, is that’d I’d post to these horrible PHP forums … The answers were neither good, nor were they correct, nor were they kindly presented.” Stack Overflow ostensibly fixes this problem by turning coder advice into a Reddit-like thread, with up-votes, down-votes, and helpful snippets. No more lengthy arguments without a clear winner; thanks to Stack Overflow, the “best” solution to a given problem is — or should be — voted to the top. In much the same way that Googling any proper noun will bring up its Wikipedia page as one of the first few links, or searching for a product will immediately bring up Amazon, searching for code will lead you to Stack Overflow. Given the amount of code currently being produced — not to mention the libraries of it undergirding essential and nonessential functions of daily life — Stack Overflow is, quietly, one of the most important websites on the planet. Not to mention one of the most popular: Launched in 2008, the site now has an Alexa traffic ranking of 52, making it one of the top 100 sites on the web. That means that in the semi-collaborative tech industry — where everyone is directly or indirectly building off of the ideas and innovations of each other — whole swaths of coders are being driven, by Google, to the same handful resources for whatever problem they’re trying to crack. Of the 36,932 developers who responded to the site’s annual survey question about site usage, less than one percent said that they had never heard of or used Stack Overflow as a resource (more than 64,000 took the survey in total). Furthermore, 90 percent of devs “find solutions that solve their coding problems here multiple times a month, and half of them find code snippets they can incorporate directly into their own work.” In other words, Stack Overflow powers the programs that power… everything else. But because most of that code exists on the backend that users never see, you might not realize how likely it is that the app or website you’re using is built on code ganked from Stack Overflow. Unless the developers slip up: Last year, the NissanConnect EV mobile app for iOS displayed this description text in its settings menu: “The spirit of stack overflow is coders helping coders.” Whoever developed it forgot to change the placeholder text that they grabbed from Stack Overflow. A screenshot from the latest version of the Nissan ConnectEV app... pic.twitter.com/Tseyvwyg3R— Scott Helme (@Scott_Helme) May 4, 2016 Copying and pasting snippets of code from Stack Overflow has become not just an open secret but a top method of troubleshooting among developers. Which raises some funny philosophical (if not legal) questions: Code is protected as intellectual property, subject to copyright and patent laws, and so copying and pasting could put coders on tricky ethical ground. But it is also a means to an end, a method of processing some bit of data and getting a desired end result. By this argument, refusing to copy code is like creating a completely different kind of tool just to hammer a nail. Is it really necessary to structure one’s code differently in order to get the same result? More practically, if you can just copy and paste what you find on Stack Overflow whenever you encounter a problem, how are you ever going to learn to code? “At Dev Bootcamp, we’re very much looking at how to change a person’s employment profile, how to get them the job that they want,” Harms explained. “Undoubtedly, part of that tool kit is going to be leveraging answer sites. There’s no doubt about that.” Critics of the site’s dominance are not too hard to find. In a 2015 blog post, Christian Heileman outlined the appeal of, and aimed a critical eye, at Stack Overflow’s forums. It’s a great tool for experts to discuss solutions with each other, but it’s not necessarily the right place to learn how to code. The joke you hear occasionally is that rather than being a full-stack developer, you become a full-stack-overflow developer. Over the phone, he explained that the site is great for experts talking to each other, but its Reddit-like gamification has hazards. “When you try to learn something and these are the first results that you find,” he explained, “you get two impressions. First of all, that there’s one way of doing it. You don’t even need to think about it you just copy and paste the thing and put it live.” The second impression a user gets is simply one of unfriendliness. “‘If you do this you’re not a professional developer’ is a very common answer in that one. That can be very discouraging for someone who is just starting.” But there are obvious downsides to relying on the internet to do your work for you, even if it offers up solutions voluntarily and with glee. Heileman — who has spent decades working at companies including Yahoo, Mozilla, and now Microsoft — believes that for novice developers, cutting corners hurts them in the long run. It’s important that they understand the code they write at a high level, rather than just relying on all-in-one solutions and packages to do the heavy lifting. This is an ongoing discussion within the developer community, most recently after an incident last year when a developer removed a simple 11-line function from a system called npm, breaking every other solution that relied on it. “I think it’s beautiful that we have those resources nowadays,” Heileman said, “but there is a danger of students just copying and pasting to get the homework out of the way rather than understanding it.” The philosophy among development-course instructors was pretty consistent, with all that I spoke to agreeing that the site is useful, but that it’s also possible for it to become a crutch. “If you just copy and paste the first thing you see, that’s very often not going to help you,” Charlie Drews, an Android development instructor at General Assembly, said. “It might make your program worse and it’s certainly not going to teach you anything.” Newer coding sites, like CodePen, Glitch, and repl.it, have leaned on that collaborative, iterative spirit to help iron out kinks. And while copying code is not directly akin to plagiarism, it is similarly easy for experienced developers to spot. Drew Mahrt, another GA instructor, said, “You can see that there’s like a stark difference [in the code] and suddenly they have these really long descriptive variable names or they’re using things that are way beyond the level that they were at previously.” Similarly perilous is the fact that code changes very quickly. Android development practices, as an example, have changed drastically over the last few years, but the popular Stack Overflow solutions are still from 2013, meaning that budding developers might be learning through outdated solutions. “The question you’re asking is one that educators have wrestled with since the Hellenic Age,” Harms noted at the beginning of our discussion. In the Phaedrus, Plato, writing as Socrates, complains of students that use the written word: “Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.” Plato, once you explained electricity, the computer, the internet, coding, and the modern economy to him, would not like Stack Overflow, which joins a long lineage of existentially perilous new innovations, beginning with writing and then, more recently, Google and Wikipedia. For coders, the site is best as a means to an end, not a catchall solution. But when you’re on deadline for a major product, and you just can’t get your code to work, there’s no better means to an end.

Ro Khanna, who came to eastern Kentucky to see what the tech industry and Appalachia can offer each other. By Nancy Scola 03/26/17 07:19 AM EDT Updated 03/27/17 10:50 AM EDT Rep. Ro Khanna and Appalachian Regional Commission Co-Chairman Earl Gohl chat as they head from the Big Sandy Community and Technical College main building in Paintsville, Ky., to the Interapt coding bootcamp across the street. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print PAINTSVILLE, Kentucky — President Donald Trump won this state by a landslide after promising to reopen Appalachia’s coal mines and put its miners back to work. But here, along the banks of Paint Creek in eastern Kentucky’s legendary coal fields, some displaced workers are pinning their hopes instead on Silicon Valley. And the celebrity of the moment is California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who came from the Valley’s deep-blue heart last week to see what this emptying corner of coal country might have to offer the technology industry — and how Appalachia can reap its benefits in the form of jobs and tech training. Story Continued Below "It's just exciting for them to think what we're doing is interesting enough to make the trip," former coal worker and budding app developer Steve Bowling said in a cinder-block classroom in Paintsville — referring to Khanna and, by extension, the tech industry itself. "That means a whole lot to us." The 40-year-old freshman congressman and son of Indian immigrants might seem an unlikely ambassador to a conservative region: He supports what he calls “common-sense” gun laws, not to mention the Obama-era energy regulations that the coal industry blames for shuttering dozens of coal plants in the past decade. But he hopes that by expounding upon the Silicon Valley success story across the U.S., he might help boost the economic prospects of places like Paintsville. And if he can convey the woes of non-coastal regions to leaders back home, the tech industry might find a way to steer where the country goes from here. “The election was a wakeup call about how much discontent there is from technological progress and globalization, that it’s not just all a clear good thing,” Khanna said in his still-bare Capitol Hill office just before his trip, where he visited a training program for mobile app developers at Big Sandy Community & Technical College. And it’s time, he said, for an industry that has played a role in shedding American jobs — by advancing artificial intelligence, among other things — to invest in helping communities like this one share in the upside. “There’s got to be greater empathy among those in Silicon Valley for some of the pain that has been caused,” he said. At the same time, he’s looking to spread Silicon Valley’s aspirational spirit around a country in need of big thinking. “It's just getting people to dream that they can go try to be like Elon Musk or Steve Jobs,” Khanna said. The 43-room mansion of John C. Mayo, a teacher-turned-entrepreneur regarded as the father of the eastern Kentucky coal industry, is now the home of Our Lady of the Mountains School. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Khanna came here at the invitation Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers¸ a 79-year-old Republican who joined Congress the year Ronald Reagan moved into the White House. Rogers' sprawling district is among the poorest in the country — ranked 432nd out of 435 in median per-capita income according to the Almanac of American Politics — and the setting for the best-selling guide-to-Trump-country "Hillbilly Elegy." By contrast, companies including Apple, Intel, eBay, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Tesla are all stuffed within Khanna’s overwhelmingly Democratic, wealthy and compact district; Google, while headquartered in nearby Mountain View, has offices there, too. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and Megan Smith, the Google executive who served as Barack Obama’s U.S. chief technology officer, also came to the event, giving speeches and chatting over foam-containered chicken salad sandwiches and potato chips. But for the crowd of about 150 people, Khanna's attention was what they craved. Rogers was eager to have him in what he calls “Silicon Holler,” because Khanna has quickly become a one-man proxy for a swath of glitteringly brand-name and geographically concentrated Silicon Valley companies. “It’s a chance for us to sell him, and therefore them, that this is a place to look at," said Rogers. That he's actually come, joked Earl Gohl, co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission — founded in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy — makes Khanna his “new best friend.” Still, shortly after he stepped off stage with Khanna, Rogers fielded a question on whether he holds any bad feelings over the tech industry’s growing disdain for coal, such as Facebook’s new hydropowered data center in Luleå, Sweden. His answer? If the goal is keeping Appalachian people in the rolling hills of Paintsville and Pikesville and Harlan County, not fleeing to places like Ypsilanti and Cincinnati, America’s tech boom might be the last best hope. “We can't afford to be too resentful," said the Republican. “We'd rather sleep here.” Republican Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), former U.S. CTO Megan Smith, Rep. Ro Khanna and Appalachian Regional Commission Co-Chairman Earl Gohl chat March 13 before a round table luncheon on developing Eastern Kentucky from a coal based economy to a "Silicon Holler." | John Shinkle/POLITICO Khanna, a lawyer and former official in the Obama-era Commerce Department, came to the tan-bricked, 1950s-built community college, where every other car in the parking lot is a hulking, mud-spattered American-made pickup truck. Founded in 1790 as Paint Lick Station, this is a town that honors its coal history. The bricked-and-columned 43-room mansion built on the cusp of World War I by John C. Mayo, the teacher-turned-entrepreneur regarded as the father of the eastern Kentucky coal industry, stands a block over. It’s now Our Lady of the Mountains School. But gone are the days where you could get a $70,000 job in the mines with a ninth-grade education and buy one of the lovely homes dotting the hills here. Since 2008, coal jobs in eastern Kentucky have dropped from more than 14,000 to fewer than 4,000. And even the jobs still available don't look like a smart long-term bet, making scraping out a living underground even less attractive than it's ever been. The event on display here, convened more or less in Khanna's honor, amounted to speeches, a roundtable discussion and demonstrations about a program called TechHire Eastern Kentucky, or TEKY — pronounced, conveniently, "techie." The program, backed by $2.75 million in federal funds, trains a crop of would-be mobile app developers for four months and puts them in a four-month paid internship with a Louisville software company called Interapt. (That money flowed through the Appalachian Regional Commission, which Trump, in his first budget, included on the list of agencies he’d completely defund. Rogers called those cuts “draconian, careless and counterproductive.”) TechHire, begun as a federal program in the Obama White House in 2015, was inspired by the tech industry's complaint that it has 600,000 job openings it can't fill, a major drag on its bottom line and ambitions, and part of its justification for seeking more visas for specialized workers from overseas. But the people who have brought Khanna argue that this crunch exists partly because the industry simply doesn’t hirethe sort of people sitting in cinder-block classrooms in eastern Kentucky. The former coal worker Bowling, 41, said his wife found out about TEKY on Facebook after he’d beenlaid off from a job in a coal mine filling blasting holes with ammonium nitrate. He chose the Android app training track over the more structured Apple iOS trackbecause his instructors "described it as, 'It's the Wild Wild West.'" Others have come to the program to avoid coal. Sean Crowl, 29, says he lost his job when the Kmart in town closed. Crowl sat at a roundtable of young men — the class of 35 trainees, from a pool of 800 applicants, is overwhelming male and white — who came from a bank, a school, a restaurant or unemployment to build apps like one for a local nonprofit that helps track elementary school students' reading progress. The $400 a week was appealing, as a two-bedroom apartment can be had here at that price. (One trainee says it was so good he thought it was a "scam" until he heard about the paycheck.) All six said four months was plenty of time to learn how to build apps good enough for the Google Play marketplace or Apple's App Store. Interapt CEO Ankur Gopal and Rep. Ro Khanna speak with trainees in the TechHire Eastern Kentucky coding program at the local campus of Big Sandy Community and Technical College on March 13. | John Shinkle/POLITICO The pitch Rogers and others are making here is that Silicon Valley hiring managers would be smart to open their eyes to places beyond San Francisco and New York — and they’re pitchingeastern Kentucky as the type of undervalued investment that venture capitalists love to go on about. They argue that the internet erases some of the region's traditional limitations, such as a dearth of well-maintained roads in many places, as well as of flat ground for building factories. The people say they are hard-working and open to low wages. And unlike, say, Bangalore, it's in a reasonable time zone. But for all the tech industry’s talk of meritocracy, "when employers say they can't hire people with skills, what they're really saying is that they can't find people with a certain pedigree," said Byron Auguste, a former deputy director of the White House National Economic Council who helped create TechHire. Auguste is now president of Opportunity@Work, the non-profit group administering the program. The result, he said, is that people from places like Paintsville don't get access to the enormous sums that companies like those in Khanna's district invest in training. "People are on the outside looking in, forever," Augustesaid. “People say, ‘How many former coal miners can learn to code?’ And my answer is, it’s too early to tell. Only a handful have been given an opportunity, and they’ve done pretty damn well.” Of Khanna, Auguste said: “We want him to be able to go back to Silicon Valley and his constituent companies and say, ‘No joke, there’s really a lot of talent here.’" Being taken seriously is, in fact, a recurring theme. Interapt CEO Ankur Gopal wants Khanna to see that what's going on here isn't some “cute thing.” Jared Arnett, executive director of Shaping Our Appalachian Region, quotes a colleague saying he wants to prove “we're not just a dancing bear.” Khanna said he's listening. "The tech companies and tech industry have an incentive to rethink their own labor practices so that they aren't just hiring in Stanford and Santa Clara, but are broader about what their hiring practices are and the skills they need," he said. That said, Khanna told the crowd in Paintsville, "it has to be a partnership. I don't think it's an act of Silicon Valley's charity. It's in their interest to harness the talent, the energy and the spirit here. That's going to make their companies better. That's going to make our country better." And that, says Khanna, is what he's going to go back and tell the tech industry. The event includedno talk of Trump, his campaign pledge to “bring those miners back” or the attackshe's heaped on the tech industry for everything from manufacturing its products abroad to refusing to open up its consumer products to law enforcement. But Auguste said the warm feelings for the tech industry evident at Big Sandy Community College aren't widely distributed across the U.S. “The country should love Silicon Valley. It’s a gem and a treasure,” he said. “But when push comes to shove, in a lot of parts of the country, it’s difficult to find people who’d say, ‘Silicon Valley has done much for me.’” Khanna said he also wants to help his own home-district industry expand its thinking on Silicon Valley’s role in society. “What I want to do is to help shape the thinking of the Valley to start caring more and engaging more in policy that's not narrow,” Khanna said. “You get almost the same talking points about [tax] repatriation, encryption, patent trolls. I say, ‘What an impoverished vision for a place that literally believes it wants to change human civilization.'"

It's not very stable right now; indeed, the Android Beta Program won't see it until mid-May, with a final release coming in the third quarter. The new version of the OS brings a number of improvements, most of which are in the Settings app, which is all-new. System UI Tuner offers quite a few new tweaks, but those tend to be even more subject to change than the rest of the OS. As usual, there are also some changes to notifications. Users can choose to snooze notifications, or go directly to the app's notification settings directly from the shade. Naturally, we installed the Android O Developer Preview on a Nexus 5X and dove right into it. Here's our hands on video with the OS: If you want to try out the Preview for yourself, you can find a tutorial for flashing it to your device here.

            name='Companies pull ads from offensive content'></iframe> Copy and paste the embed code above. Mar 26, 2017 - 10:10 Two well-known Swiss companies have followed the lead of hundreds of British companies that have stopped advertising on Google and YouTube to prevent their brands from being associated with neo-Nazi and other extremist videos. (SRF/swissinfo.ch) Switzerland’s biggest life insurance company, Swiss Life, and food manufacturer Baer told Swiss public broadcaster SRF’s “10vor10” program that placing their ads next to offensive or right-wing videos causes reputational damage. Google bought the ubiquitous YouTube platform for $1.65 billion in 2006. Algorithms, not a conscious human decision, place the ads next to objectionable content which also includes right-wing conspiracy theorists. Nevertheless, Swiss Life and Baer described their companies as shocked and outraged at the practice. According to the TV program, the same phenomenon affects ads by other major Swiss enterprises such as supermarket chains Coop and Migros and manufacturers Nivea and Ricola. More than 250 companies in Great Britain have reportedly ended advertising deals with Google because their ads were placed next to offensive content. Google told the TV program it has taken some measures to block such content and prevent the occurrence, and wishes to "expressly apologise" for cases of "displaying brands in the context of content that does not match their values".

Aiming to provide connectivity in remote areas, railways will set up Wi-Fi hotspot kiosks at about 500 stations and help people access an array of online services, including various government schemes. Christened as Railwire Saathi, the Wi-Fi kiosks will function like a PCO for Digital India and enable people to use services like e-commerce, online banking, offer them access to open school/university and insurance schemes, e-ticketing for train and bus services among others. Automated form filling, mobile and DTH recharge are other services which the Railwire Saathi is expected to provide in areas with limited connectivity. The Railwire Saathi aims to provide connectivity to the unconnected and at the same time offer jobs opportunities in rural areas, a senior railway ministry official said. While railways is equipping about 400 stations with free Wi-Fi service in association with Google, this scheme has dual aim - providing jobs as well as connectivity. He said the scheme is expected to be operational by May. The Railwire Saathi is a Wi-Fi entrepreneurship model where unemployed youths, preferably women, can be trained and supported to set up a Wi-Fi hotspot and provide a platform to online services which will make the business sustainable, he said. RailTel, the telecom arm of railways, would execute the scheme across the country. Though there are various schemes for minorities, farmers, common man and many avenues for completing education, people in remote areas are generally not aware of them or find it difficult to access them, said the official. Unemployed youth who wants to be RailWire Saathi would have to contact RailTel for necessary training. The training course will be approved by National Skill Development Council (NSDC). After being trained by RailTel, the youth will get certificate which can be used to get loan under the Mudra scheme, he said. Using the loan money, they will install and manage the Wi-Fi hotspots as per design provide by RailTel. Railwire Saathi will help in disseminating information about various government schemes like Pradhan Mantri Ujjwal Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna, Pradhan Mantri Atal Pension Yojna, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Beema Yojna and Pradhan Mantri Surakhya Beema Yojna among others. tags Wi-Fi Railwire Saathi Railway Indian railway Wi-Fi kiosks more from india Indian Oil to supply one million tonnes fuel annually to Nepal for 5 years Mar 28, 2017 08:22 IST While you were away: Top 10 stories to bring you up to date Mar 28, 2017 07:43 IST FD vs Stocks: Which One Should You Choose?

The government is also calling for security services to be given access to encrypted WhatsApp messages, warning it is 'completely unacceptable' that terrorists can plot in secret.  Focus on the issue has intensified in the wake of the deadly attack on Westminster last week, when Khalid Masood used a hired car to mow down dozens of pedestrians before stabbing a policeman to death at the gates of parliament. Concerns have been raised that information on how to mount a terror attack is still easily accessible online. Before the atrocity Google had already been forced to promise it would take a 'tougher stance' on hateful content after an outcry and boycotts from advertisers over its content appearing alongside extreme material.  Home Secretary Ms Rudd named and shamed lesser known websites like Telegram, Wordpress and Justpaste.it today as she widened the Government's criticism.  The Home Secretary left the door open to changing the law if necessary. But she said she would rather see an industry-wide board doing it independently, as the best people to take action are those who understand the technology and the 'necessary hashtags'.

'It used to be that people would steam-open envelopes or just listen in on phones when they wanted to find out what people were doing, legally, through warrantry. 'But on this situation we need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.' Ms Rudd said she was calling in a 'fairly long list' of relevant organisations for a meeting on the issue this week, including social media platforms. Ms Rudd said she was calling in a 'fairly long list' of relevant internet organisations for a meeting on the issue of extremism this week Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he found it 'disgusting' that net firms were not taking tougher action against extreme literature  'What these companies have to realise is that they are now publishing companies, they are not technology companies, they are platforms and we need to make sure that that (hosting extremist material) stops,' she said. 'You are right, we will not resile from taking action if we need to do so.' But she went on: 'I would rather get a situation where we get all these people around the table agreeing to do it. 'I know it sounds a bit like we're stepping away from legislation but we're not.  'What I'm saying is the best people who understand the technology, who understand the necessary hashtags to stop this stuff even being put up, not just taking it down, but stopping it being put up in the first place, are going to be them.'  Mr Johnson called on internet providers and social media companies to develop new technology to detect and remove jihadist and other extreme material. He accused them of 'not acting when they are tipped off', adding in an interview with the Sunday Times: 'I'm furious about it. 'It's disgusting. 'They need to stop just making money out of prurient violent material.'  Mr Johnson added: 'They are not acting when they are tipped off. Khalid Masood used a hired car to mow down dozens of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before entering the grounds of Parliament and stabbing Pc Keith Palmer to death 'Evil flourishes when good men do nothing - and that's what's happening here. 'They are putting up adverts next to it.' The interventions come after Prime Minister Theresa May urged internet companies to do more to prevent terror and hate being spread in cyberspace.  An investigation by the Sunday Mirror uncovered a host of messages encouraging extremist violence exchanged on the encrypted Telegram messaging site. They included an image of a sword-bearing jihadi fighter standing in front of a burning Big Ben, sent weeks before Wednesday's terror attack on Parliament. Another reportedly shared details of how to carry out an atrocity, saying: 'Methods can include entering the stadium and detonating an explosive(s). 'Attacking fans/security at full time in the vicinity of the car park area or exits of the stadium. 'Devices can be left in around the stadium, bars, cars, busses, trains, transportation etc. 'Attacks can compromise of explosives, gun attacks, knife, martyrdom vests, CHEMICAL and any other.' Theresa May vowed to show terrorists that 'we are not afraid' as she addressed the House of Commons in the wake of the attack   Share or comment on this article e-mail 25 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Dad confronts policewoman who confiscated daffodils from daughters UNC's Luke Maye goes to his 8AM class after beating Kentucky Dramatic moment a car is struck by lightning as it drives down road Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Make it so!

Let’s set some ground rules. This column isn’t about the hottest and most anticipated gadgets of 2017. That list is really easy to draw up with the iPhone X/8/10, Samsung S8 and the Note 8, Nokia’s still unannounced super flagship phone, Google Pixel watch, LG W – the thin as a wallpaper TV, Tesla’s all-new Model Supercar 3, Project Scorpio, Microsoft’s next-gen gaming console. Here are five incredible gadgets or technologies that could change the game and yet aren’t very well known so far. Think of it as an exclusive preview to the unknown sleeper hits that will blow your mind in 2017. The suitcase that thinks it’s a dog No, it won’t bark or even roll over to get its tummy tickled. This one will follow you all on its own. All you do is wear a special belt with a sensor and the suitcase rolls behind you making sure it avoids all the obstacles and people that come in between. It’s got cameras and other features to make sure it keeps up with you. This is the latest innovation by a Piaggio division called Fast Forward and for some reason, they call this The Gita. Future versions won’t need you to even wear the belt. So pack in those clothes and take your suitcase for a walk at the airport. The Gita is a suitcase that won’t need any lugging around The cupboard that thinks it’s a maid The ‘Laundroid’ cupboard is a boon for all housewives I had given a short preview of this earlier. Finally, I got to experience the real thing. Collect all your dirty clothes, pile them into a drawer and come back after a few hours. The ‘Laundroid’ cupboard will have washed, dried, ironed, sorted and shelved all your clothes according to your wishes. Thus, different family members’ clothes will go the designated shelves, all your shirts in one place, all your ‘delicates’ colour-matched and lovingly laid out in another. This is a cupboard that may well change your life – one underwear at a time. The shoes that think they are a movie The Nike HyperAdapt shoes can lace up to perfection on their own In the movie Back to the Future, the main character has the most incredible sneakers ever. As he puts them on, they self-lace, tighten and are ready for action. It’s been every geek and nerd’s dream to have one of those. And that time is here. Nike showcased self-lacing shoes a while back and a few prototypes were also doing some rounds, but now the real thing is here. And they look even better than the ones in the movie (in hindsight, they look really ugly now). The Nike HyperAdapt are nice looking, super sleek and actually very comfortable. And yes, they do lace up to near perfection all on their own. A Scarf that thinks it’s an air purifier You can now breathe fresh air with the Wair Well, this one just doesn’t think it’s one – it actually is. Personal air purifiers are the solution to the greatest problem faced by all of us in India. You can use an air purifier in a closed room, but what do you when you’re in the great outdoors? That’s where ‘Wair’ wraps itself around you. It looks like a designer scarf (it comes in quite a few designs), but actually has a 360-degree filtration device system built inside it. Wear it around your neck and it pumps out clean, pure air directly into the space around you. Looks much better than those Darth Vader-like face masks too. The VR headset that think it’s Donald Trump The Vive 2 takes VR to a new level How do you get a headset to completely ignore reality and immerse itself in a self-made virtual world? You get HTC to make it. The original Vive HR has gained a cult following and is now the gold standard in VR. But the Vive 2 moves to the places no VR headset has gone before. It’s completely wireless, and has almost zero pixelisation and some add-ons that take the immersive experience to a whole new level. The Vive 2 may not be able to build a wall along Mexico, but it can make you scale the walls of VR to a whole new height. These are the kind of devices that aren’t changing the rules of the game, they are changing the game itself!

Doodles are the fun, surprising, and sometimes spontaneous changes that are made to the Google logo to celebrate holidays, anniversaries, and the lives of famous artists, pioneers, and scientists. In 2013, Google, for the first time in its history, posted a special Doodle for Bangladesh on its 43th Independence Day.

PHOTO: REUTERS WASHINGTON: Are robots coming for your job? Although technology has long affected the labor force, recent advances in artificial intelligence and robotics are heightening concerns about automation replacing a growing number of occupations, including highly skilled or “knowledge-based” jobs. Just a few examples: self-driving technology may eliminate the need for taxi, Uber and truck drivers, algorithms are playing a growing role in journalism, robots are informing consumers as mall greeters, and medicine is adapting robotic surgery and artificial intelligence to detect cancer and heart conditions. Smartphone-powered robots launched for school students Of 700 occupations in the United States, 47 percent are at “high risk” from automation, an Oxford University study concluded in 2013. A McKinsey study released this year offered a similar view, saying “about half” of activities in the world’s workforce “could potentially be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies.” Still, McKinsey researchers offered a caveat, saying that only around five percent of jobs can be “fully automated.” robot retrieving medicines in the pharmacy of the Argenteuil hospital, in Argenteuil, a Paris suburb. PHOTO: AFP Another report, by PwC this month, concluded that around a third of jobs in the United States, Germany and Britain could be eliminated by automation by the early 2030s, with the losses concentrated in transportation and storage, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade. But experts warn that such studies may fail to grasp the full extent of the risks to the working population. “The studies are underestimating the impact of technology — some 80 to 90 percent of jobs will be eliminated in the next 10 to 15 years,” said Vivek Wadhwa, a tech entrepreneur and faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley. Meet the droid who serves piping hot pizzas in Multan “Artificial intelligence is moving a lot faster than anyone had expected,” said Wadhwa, who is co-author of a forthcoming book on the topic. “Alexa (Amazon’s home hub) and Google Home are getting amazingly intelligent very fast. Microsoft and Google have demonstrated that AI can understand human speech better than humans can.” Wadhwa calls the driverless car a “metaphor” for the future of labor and a sign of a major shift. Warnings of dire social consequences from automation have also come from the likes of the physicist Stephen Hawking and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, among others. Hebrew University of Jerusalem historian Yuval Harari writes in his 2017 book, “Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow” that technology will lead to “superfluous people” as “intelligent non-conscious algorithms” improve. People looking at a self-driving vehicle, as it is tested in a pedestrianised zone, during a media event in Milton Keynes, north of London. PHOTO: AFP “As algorithms push humans out of the job market,” he writes, “wealth and power might become concentrated in the hands of the tiny elite that owns the all-powerful algorithms, creating unprecedented social and political inequality.” Harari points to the Oxford study, estimating a high probability of job loss to automation — cashiers (97 percent), paralegals (94 percent), bakers (89 percent) and bartenders (77 percent), for example. Others disagree. Boston University economist and researcher James Bessen dismisses alarmist predictions, contending that advances in technology generally lead to more jobs, even if the nature of work changes. His research found that the proliferation of ATM machines did not decrease bank tellers’ employment in recent decades, and that automation of textile mills in the 19th century led to an increase in weaving jobs because it created more demand. “Robots can replace humans in certain tasks but don’t entirely replace humans,” he said. China turns to robots as workers age But he acknowledged that automation “is destroying a lot of low-skill, low wage jobs, and the new jobs being created need higher skills.” Former president Barack Obama’s council of economic advisors also warned last year that most jobs paying less than $20 an hour “would come under pressure from automation.” Although the net impact of robots remains unclear, tech leaders and others are already debating how to deal with the potential job displacement. Microsoft founder Bill Gates said last month that he supports a “robot tax,” an idea floated in Europe, including by a socialist presidential candidate in France. But Bessen, a former fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center, said taxing robots could be counterproductive. “You don’t want to be taxing the machines because they enable people to earn higher wages,” he said. “If you tax machines, you will slow the beneficial side of the process.” robot interacting with visitors at the Soft Bank robotics stand at the Cebit technology fair in Hanover, Germany. PHOTO: AFP Peter Diamandis, chairman of the X Prize Foundation for technical innovation and founder of the Silicon Valley think-tank Singularity University, is among those calling for a “universal basic income” to compensate people for job losses. Offering income guarantees “will be one of many tools empowering self-actualization at scale,” he said in a blog post, arguing that automation will allow people “to follow their passions, be more creative.” Watch Avatar-style South Korean manned robot take first baby steps But Wadhwa says the problems run deeper and will require more creative solutions. “A basic income won’t solve the social problems of joblessness because people’s identity revolves around our jobs,” he said. “Even if we have enough food and energy, we have to deal with the social disruption that’s coming. We need a much broader discussion.” Bessen says reversing the trends of the past decades, where high-skilled jobs gain at the expense of others, pose a “big challenge.” “It’s entirely possible we can meet the challenge,” he said. “But the evidence in the past 20 years is that things are moving in the wrong direction.” Read more: Artificial Intelligence , robots , Tech Read full story Recommended Stories Meet the droid who serves piping hot pizzas in Multan Robotic waiter runs on a battery for about 12 hours on one charge China turns to robots as workers age The country is already the world's largest market for the mechanical helpers Smartphone-powered robots launched for school students Aim is to transform Pakistan into an engineering hub New wave of robots set to deliver the goods Startup Starship is launching a pilot project of robotic deliveries in early February Humans aren't the only ones using internet According to a new report, most of the internet traffic usage now comes from robots Facebook Conversations Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

Which is the baby wipe anniversary, I believe. Or perhaps the Swiffer anniversary. Either way, we had no money for gifts after Googling local preschool prices. But it didn't matter. The sun was shining. I was wearing a skirt and non-pregnancy underwear. And my mother-in-law was in town, happily volunteering to watch our adorable spawn so we could drink wine at a restaurant while not simultaneously dodging baby headbutts for once. It was just what two stressed-out parents of small children needed. So, naturally, we spent most of the day in the emergency room. What happened, you ask? Good question. I still don't know. But to sum up, I felt like I was dying for 45 minutes and then felt completely fine. After an exam and some tests and an ultrasound, it was discovered that I had a very serious case of absolutely nothing being wrong with me. My official diagnosis was "um.your gallbladder, maybe?" followed by that shoulder shrug emoji. It was just what two stressed-out parents of small children didn't need. Instead of a nice dinner and adult cocktails not served in a sippy cup and a clumsy make-out session in the driveway, we have an unnecessary medical bill heading our way. Love. Ain't it grand? But that's what marriage looks like after seven years and two kids and one aging dog. Reality has replaced all the dopamine. You don't generally have time to be all lovey-dovey. Or shoot, even lovey at this point. We're lucky if we have a free hand to occasionally high-five one another. So, you have to show your love in other ways. It's saying "I'll clean up the dog vomit." It's saying "make sure you eat something." It's saying, "I duct-taped that one part of the dishwasher so it won't make the high-pitched noise that you hate anymore." It's hearing the baby cry in the middle of the night, again, followed by hearing, "Go back to sleep, I got her." It's hearing your partner use every curse word ever invented as they try to get said baby back to sleep and not judging them. It's hearing those three most beautiful words in the English language, "Take a nap." It's hearing the blissful laughter of small children who are being thoroughly entertained and distracted by another adult so you can spend six and a half minutes alone in the bathroom. It's making a big breakfast every morning even though you're exhausted because it's likely the only meal the two of you will get to eat together. It's the arms from out of nowhere that hug you from behind while you're standing at the kitchen sink stress-eating cheese. It's laughing off the fact the other person tried to karate chop your face when you hugged them from behind because it startled them because it's been so long since you two were able to touch in a manner that didn't include passing a small child back and forth. It's coming home with a bottle of wine when you know they've had a bad day. It's coming home with a handle of Captain Morgan when you know they've had a bad week. It's springing for the extra pizza topping even though money is tight because they deserve sausage and pepperoni, dammit. It's saving the last doughnut for them but they're saving the last doughnut for you, so said doughnut just sits there until it becomes inedible and you finally throw away the glazed petrified disk five days later. It's refraining from watching the next episode of "West World" for nine days straight because the other one is too tired to make it through an entire hourlong show once the kids are asleep. It's chugging coffee at 7:30 p.m. so you can finally make it through an episode of "West World" because the other one has been so patient for the past nine days. It's having inside jokes, which are made only funnier because you're both suffering from extreme sleep deprivation. It's giving them a firm, even stern, pep talk when they dare to start to doubt themselves. It's carrying around two kids all day and carrying an old dog up and down the stairs and still wanting to hear about their day no matter how tired you are. It's going to work all day and carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders and still wanting to hear all about how the baby almost crawled today. It's knowing that this is one of the hardest yet best times in both your lives. Which is why you rush home from work in a panic when your loved one calls and says, "I think I need to go the emergency room." And why, when you are curled up in the fetal position on the floor, writhing in mysterious pain, your only thought is that you can't die because you love all these people too much. Happy anniversary, Ryan. I love you. And the best gift I can give you after all these years is to let you know I wouldn't change a thing. Also, we're out of baby wipes.

"A week after Google apologized for running customers' advertisements alongside objectionable videos, triggering a change in policy, its YouTube site is still rife with examples that are angering more big advertisers and causing some to cut spending with the tech giant," reports the Dow Jones Newswire. Reporters from the Wall Street Journal spotted ads from Microsoft, Amazon, and Procter & Gamble appearing on hate videos -- and thus indirectly funding them. An anonymous reader quotes their report: Asked about the Journal's finding that their ads were still appearing with such content on YouTube as of Thursday night, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dish Network Corp. said Friday they were suspending spending on all Google advertising except targeted search ads. Starbucks Corp. and General Motors Co. said they were pulling their ads from YouTube. FX Networks, part of 21st Century Fox Inc., said it was suspending all advertising spending on Google, including search ads and YouTube. Wal-Mart said: "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values." An executive at one of the affected companies complained that Google "had assured us over the past few days that our brands were safe from this type of content. Despite their assurances, it's clear they couldn't give assurance." google youtube advertising ← Related Links → SAS Mocked For Recommending 60% Proprietary Software, 40% Open Source YouTube Says Content Owners Made $1B Last Year -- So Music Labels Should Stop Complaining Google To Revamp Policies, Hire Staff After UK Ad Scandal YouTube Loses Major Advertisers Over Offensive Videos Terrifying Anti-Riot Vehicle Created To Quash Any Urban Disturbance Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos More | Reply Login Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

(AAP) Although technology has long affected the labor force, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are heightening concerns about automation replacing a growing number of occupations, including highly skilled or "knowledge-based" jobs. Self-driving technology may eliminate the need for taxi, Uber and truck drivers, algorithms are playing a growing role in journalism, robots are informing consumers as mall greeters, and medicine is adapting robotic surgery and artificial intelligence to detect cancer and heart conditions. Of 700 occupations in the United States, 47 percent are at "high risk" from automation, an Oxford University study concluded in 2013. A McKinsey study released this year offered a similar view, saying "about half" of activities in the world's workforce "could potentially be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies." Still, McKinsey researchers offered a caveat, saying that only around five percent of jobs can be "fully automated". A report by PwC this month concluded that around a third of jobs in the United States, Germany and Britain could be eliminated by automation by the early 2030s, with the losses concentrated in transportation, storage, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade. But experts have warned such studies may fail to grasp the full extent of the risks to the working population. "The studies are underestimating the impact of technology - some 80 to 90 percent of jobs will be eliminated in the next 10 to 15 years," said Vivek Wadhwa, a tech entrepreneur and faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley. "Artificial intelligence is moving a lot faster than anyone had expected," said Mr Wadhwa, who is co-author of a forthcoming book on the topic. "Alexa (Amazon's home hub) and Google Home are getting amazingly intelligent very fast. Microsoft and Google have demonstrated that AI can understand human speech better than humans can." Mr Wadhwa calls the driverless car a "metaphor" for the future of labor and a sign of a major shift. Warnings of dire social consequences from automation have also come from the likes of the physicist Stephen Hawking and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, among others. Hebrew University of Jerusalem historian Yuval Harari wrote in his 2017 book, "Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow", technology will lead to "superfluous people" as "intelligent non-conscious algorithms" improve. "As algorithms push humans out of the job market, wealth and power might become concentrated in the hands of the tiny elite that owns the all-powerful algorithms, creating unprecedented social and political inequality, Mr Harari wrote.  Mr Harari points to the Oxford study, estimating a high probability of job loss to automation - cashiers (97 percent), paralegals (94 percent), bakers (89 percent) and bartenders (77 percent), for example. Others disagree. Boston University economist and researcher James Bessen dismisses alarmist predictions, contending that advances in technology generally lead to more jobs, even if the nature of work changes. His research found that the proliferation of ATM machines did not decrease bank tellers' employment in recent decades, and that automation of textile mills in the 19th century led to an increase in weaving jobs because it created more demand. "Robots can replace humans in certain tasks but don't entirely replace humans," Mr Bessen said. But he acknowledged automation "is destroying a lot of low-skill, low wage jobs, and the new jobs being created need higher skills". Former president Barack Obama's council of economic advisors also warned last year that most jobs paying less than $20 an hour "would come under pressure from automation". Although the net impact of robots remains unclear, tech leaders and others are already debating how to deal with the potential job displacement. Microsoft founder Bill Gates said last month that he supports a "robot tax", an idea floated in Europe, including by a socialist presidential candidate in France. But Mr Bessen, a former fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center, said taxing robots could be counterproductive. "You don't want to be taxing the machines because they enable people to earn higher wages," he said. "If you tax machines, you will slow the beneficial side of the process." Peter Diamandis, chairman of the X Prize Foundation for technical innovation and founder of the Silicon Valley think-tank Singularity University, is among those calling for a "universal basic income" to compensate people for job losses. Offering income guarantees "will be one of many tools empowering self-actualization at scale", he said in a blog post, arguing that automation will allow people "to follow their passions, be more creative". But Mr Wadhwa said the problems run deeper and will require more creative solutions. "A basic income won't solve the social problems of joblessness because people's identity revolves around our jobs," he said. "Even if we have enough food and energy, we have to deal with the social disruption that's coming. We need a much broader discussion." Mr Bessen said reversing the trends of the past decades, where high-skilled jobs gain at the expense of others, pose a "big challenge." "It's entirely possible we can meet the challenge," he said. "But the evidence in the past 20 years is that things are moving in the wrong direction." © AFP 2017 Technology World TRENDING VIDEO Cow has beef with police officer in Texas A loose heifer has been filmed charging at a police officer who had followed it through paddocks in Texas.

Seeing as it's unlikely to be supplanted anytime soon, companies such as Google and Dropbox have been working hard to squeeze every last byte out of its compression abilities. For Dropbox, the solution was Lepton, delivering images 22 per cent smaller with no quality loss. Now Google has its own option — Guetzli. And you can try it yourself right now. Normally, you'd have to grab the Guetzli source from GitHub and compile it yourself. Fortunately, as gHacks' Martin Brinkmann discovered, a more user-friendly approach is available, via an application called FileOptimizer. Created by Javier Gutiérrez Chamorro, FileOptimizer supports a great many formats and encoding methods, including Guetzli. However, it's not enabled out of the box. Here's how to switch it on (courtesy of gHacks): 1. Open the fileoptimizer.ini file. You find it in the main user folder, e.g. C:\users\martin\fileoptimizer.ini 2. Locate the parameter JPEGAllowLossy, and set it to true. This is done by replacing false in the line with true, so that the beginning of the line reads JPEGAllowLossy=true 3. Restart FileOptimizer if it is running already. From his testing, Brinkmann found that Guetzli performed as advertised, reducing JPEGs by 20-30 per cent with no perceptible loss in quality. The bad news is, it takes forever to produce this result. So give it a whirl... but only if your PC has nothing better to do today.

Isn’t that amazing, the power of time travel with words. Also, it’s the only way that I can tell you funny things while at the same time doing those mommy tasks that need doing. Speaking of time travel, if you missed out on what happened this week, allow me to take you back in time with all the important stories. Best Stories If you’ve ever wandered around a shopping center parking lot looking for your car, I have some good news for you. Actually, Google does – Google Maps can now help you remember where you parked your car. Also, if you’re one of the very few people who own an Xbox One but never played Ryse or The Walking Dead: Season 2, you’re in luck as it seems they are coming to Xbox Live’s Games with Gold. The leaks have begun, y’all! Destiny 2 is coming, and this box art looks fake enough to be real. Worst Stories The Terminator will always be back, right? RIGHT? Well, apparently not anymore. At least, not with its enduring lead actor. Apple has revealed a sexy new red phone, but you know what sucks? The front is still white! Who does that? Don’t they know that black is best and the phone would be even more gorgeous (and a must by) with a black front? Truly, though, the worst story of the week is the fact that the internet mobs descended on a woman who worked on Mass Effect Andromeda. She was harassed and her integrity questioned all because of the sometime janky animations in the new game. Did none of these people play the original games and see those animations? More importantly, is normal human decency so completely dead? I hate stories like these. Random Stories I loved Mystery Science Theater 3000 when I watched it back in the day. It’s making a comeback on Netflix, and it’s… odd. But that’s what was always so delightful about the original. How long does it take to learn impressive fight choreography? 15 minutes, if you’re Finn Jones. Doctor Dolittle was never my thing. Talking animals just feel a little too silly for me, but of course it’s a popular film that’s due for a reboot. And who better to star in it than… Robert Downey Jr? Really? Um, okay. Reviews and features Mass Effect Andromeda review – a fantastic, fumbling fresh start Gaming legitimacy – The battle of Us vs Us Marvel’s Iron Fist season 1 review – A misguided and middling adaptation Power Rangers review – An unexpectedly good blockbuster reworking of the cheesy ’90s TV series Games shouldn’t be afraid to demand urgency from players Mass Effect: Andromeda – Romance and banging guide Nier Automata – Superb action and sublime storytelling Life Review – A tense sci-fi thriller with plenty of life Header Image of the Week Of course this wins. Well done, Darryn! Comment of the Week This week’s winner is Ottokie with his brilliant comment about Star Citizen: Schrodinger’s game. It exists but also does not exist. Bonus additional content For once, Darryn didn’t send me something from the dark reaches of the internet. Awww, too cute! Here is something else to think about this weekend.
