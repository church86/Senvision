Here are 15  data storage startups that are generating excitement. Software defined networking, the cloud, solid state storage:  there are many reasons why the days of buying an expensive storage system from an established vendor may well be numbered. Here are 15 innovative startups that may provide a better way to meet your storage needs. Data Storage Startups 1. Cloudistics Senior management: Najaf Husain (AppAssure, Bain Capital Ventures,) founder and CEO. Dr Srinidhi Varadarajan (Dell, AppAssure,) founder and CTO. Cloudistics offers on premise cloud infrastructure for virtual applications and containers in the form of a complete enterprise cloud of network, compute, storage, virtualization and management in a single platform. Its Elastic Flash Storage (EFS) is a federated virtualized storage architecture that is optimized for flash and scales independently of compute and networking resources, and its Adaptive Overlay Network (AON) technology  is a software defined virtual network that integrates with storage and compute virtualization. The company closed $15 million in Series A funding led by Bain Capital Ventures in June 2016. 2. Hedvig Senior management: Avinash Lakshman (Amazon, Facebook) founder and C EO. Srinivas Lakshman, co-founder & VP, products and operations. Hedvig's distributed storage platform is designed for both private and public clouds. It provides a high performance, elastic storage system built with low-cost commodity hardware to support any application, hypervisor, container or cloud. Enterprise storage services can be selected on a per-volume basis and include thin provisioning, disaster recovery replication, inline deduplication and compression, and storage virtualization. The company closed $18 million in a Series B funding round led by Vertex Ventures in June 2015. 3. Quobyte Senior management: Felix Hupfeld (Google) co-founder and CTO. Björn Kolbeck (Google) co-founder and CEO. Quobyte was founded by two ex-Google employees in 2013. The company's software turns servers into a horizontal software-defined storage infrastructure that can host any application. It decouples configuration and operations from the underlying hardware and is fully fault tolerant, allowing for flexible data placement. As a real file system Quobyte comes with interfaces for block storage (VMs and databases), NFS, Hadoop/Spark and S3. A policy-driven engine ensures that data is stored on the best medium in the right location. Investors include High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF) and Target Partners. 4. Datrium Key staff: Brian Biles (EMC,) co-founder and CEO, Hugo Patterson (EMC) co-founder and CTO, Sazzala Reddy (EMC) co-founder, Ganesh Venkitachalam (VMware) co-founder, Boris Weissman (VMware) co-founder. Datrium's DVX server-powered storage solution provides elastic primary storage for VMs with faster response times than all-flash arrays, at a cost that is less than half the $/GB of hybrid arrays, the company claims. The DVX system uses dumb DVX NetShelf arrays with up to 29 TB usable capacity for storing persistent data, with data services such as inline deduplication and RAID supplied by DVX Hyperdriver software run in the VMware hosts which access the data. This software offloads reads and accelerates writes, performs all dynamic performance management, and provides VM-centric administration.  The VMware hosts also have their own fast-access flash caches. Total funding comes to $55 million from individual investors including VMware co-founder Diane Greene. 5. Elastifile Senior management: Amir Aharoni (Mobixell Networks) co-founder and CEO, Shahar Frank (XtremIO) co-founder and CTO, Roni Luxenburg (Red Hat) co-founder and  VP R&D Designed from the ground up as an all-flash, software only solution, Elastifile's distributed storage platform combines full-featured enterprise file and object capabilities with linearly scalable performance, interface flexibility, analytics, and management and quality-of-service controls. It enables commodity servers to be configured as scale-out flash storage arrays, and its architecture provides sufficient scalability and elasticity to support on-premises, public cloud, and hybrid-cloud environments. The company has raised over $50 million from seven strategic market leaders from across the data center and storage industries. 6. Rubrik Senior management: Bipul Sinha (Lightspeed) co-founder and CEO.  Arvind Jain (Google) co-founder and VP of engineering. Soham Mazumdar (Tagtile) co-founder and architect. Arvind Nithrakashyap Rocketfuel) co-founder and CTO. Rubrik Cloud Data Management delivers automated backup, instant recovery, offsite replication, and data archival in a simple, scale out appliance built for hybrid clouds. It uses a system that distributes data, metadata and tasks across a cluster for linear scalability and performance. An engine assigns and executes tasks across a cluster in a fault tolerant manner to ensure that all tasks are load balanced across the cluster and are distributed to the nodes that contain the relevant data. Rubrik's data management capabilities handle data lifecycle management from ingest to archive and retirement, storing versioned data, ensuring data integrity, and applying content aware global deduplication and compression. The company announced a $61 million series C funding round led by Khosla Ventures in August 2016, bringing the company's total funding to $112 million. 7. Infinite.io Senior management: Mark Cree (Storspeed, Cisco) co-founder and CEO. Jay Rolette (HP TippingPoint) co-founder and VP of Engineering. David Sommers (NetEffect) co-founder  and VP of Operations. Infinite.io seeks to find a solution to the problem of vast amounts of inactive data that enterprises store but never access again. Its solution installs transparently in front of storage as a network based controller, migrating inactive data to low-cost cloud storage. Data is constantly migrated to the cloud based on "intelligent" policies.  These come down to much more than simply the last access data, and can be configured by administrators.  The company claims that as well as reducing costs it makes active data faster by serving it out of flash memory, from a reduced local storage footprint. Regardless of where the data is physically located it is alway presented by Infinite.io as local storage that is instantly accessible.   The company raised $3.4 million in September 2015 in a funding round led by Chicago Ventures. 8. E8 Storage Senior management: Zivan Ori (IBM) co-founder and CEO. Alex Friedman (IBM) co-founder and VP R&D. E8 Storage's rack-scale flash architecture has been designed to maximize the performance of NVMe for high-performance enterprise applications and is the first shared, software-defined NVMe solution on the market.  E8 Storage provides both the high bandwidth and low latency of NVMe drives, and the high availability and centralized provisioning of centralized storage. E8 Storage is based on open hardware components with a rack-scale architecture that is upgradable and expandable, helping to eliminate the need for storage need projections. Optimized for NVMe drives and for 40GE-100GE networks, E8's storage appliance provides very high performance even for an all-flash-array, with latency on par with local SSDs. The company raised $12 Million in series B funding led by Accel in May 2016. Page 1 of 2 1 2   Next Page >> Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

Over the past couple of months we’ve seen a few new Android Wear devices debut, and now those options have finally made their way into the Google Store. First, the Nixon Mission. After releasing through Nixon’s website and Amazon earlier this month, the watch is now listed on the Google Store as “coming soon.” The Mission sets itself apart by offering a durable, shockproof design with enhanced water resistance. With a 10ATM rating, the Mission can handle depths up to 100 meters. As of right now, it seems like the Mission will only be available in Black on the Google Store, while pricing has yet to be revealed. If priced according to other retailers, the price should fall around $399. Built to withstand the elements, The Mission boasts a category-first 10-ATM water-resistance rating.¹ The shockproof stainless steel case, durable Corning® Gorilla® Glass crystal, and 316L grade stainless steel bezel mean it’s tough enough to keep up with your adventures. Also available is the Michael Kors Access Dylan smartwatch. Originally released in retail stores only, this smartwatch brings the look of a more traditional watch with a 1.4-inch AMOLED display and Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor with 512MB and 4GB allotments for RAM and storage respectively. Priced at $350, the Dylan is another great option for anyone looking for a stylish smartwatch. It’s unclear right now if the various other Access designs will also debut on the Google Store. Designed with a classic bezel and stainless steel construction, this timepiece fuses sleek sophistication with the power of Android Wear. With customizable watch faces and interchangeable straps, there are countless ways to switch up your style. The last smartwatch option is the Polar M600. Announced nearly 3 months ago, the M600 is finally on sale as a fitness-first Android Wear smartwatch. The design resembles a Fitbit more than it does a smartwatch and doesn’t feature removable bands or a Snapdragon processor ─ a MediaTek option in its place. At $329 this isn’t the Android Wear option everyone will flock to, but it should make a good option for those who are fitness-first, notifications second. Enjoy 24/7 fitness tracking with full smartwatch functionality. Get smart notifications, send messages, and access apps from your wrist. Polar M600 Sports Watch keeps tabs on your sleep, steps, and calories between workouts. Last but not least, Google has also added the Phillips Hue Color Starter Kit to the Google Store. Being one of the first smart home options available to connect to Google Home, this shouldn’t come as any surprise. As you would expect these bulbs connect through a hub to Google Home to enable quick and easy control of home lighting, colors and all, just via your voice. The starter kit is priced at $199 and comes with a Hue Bridge and three Hue White and Color bulbs. Transform your home with color and shades of white light that you control wirelessly through your mobile device or Google Home. Relax with a warm white or stay alert with an energizing red. When you use Hue with Google Home, a voice-activated speaker, all you have to do is ask and Google Home turns your Hue lights on or off.

Ramin Talaie, Getty Images Advertisement Google’s new line of Pixel phones has the shape, pricing, and some of the features of Apple Inc.’s iPhone but — critically for investors — they also have Apple-like margins. The Pixel XL smartphone with 32 gigabytes of storage has a total build of materials and manufacturing price of $285.75, according to technology component analysis firm IHS. With a retail price of $769, that means the margins on that particular model are about $483.25 per unit, excluding costs not accounted for by IHS. This exceeds Apple’s profit on the 32 GB iPhone 7 with a smaller display, according to IHS’s analysis. Google’s margins on its first smartphone suggests that the Mountain View, California-based company not only wants Apple’s user base, but its profits, too. The Pixel is the start of a series of new products from Google parent Alphabet Inc., according to Rick Osterloh, the senior vice president in charge of hardware. The margins suggest that “Google is getting the same pricing for the same components as other tier one manufacturers of phones,” said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking for IHS Markit. “They have as much pull as any of the big guys.” Popular Now Tesla’s Future in Trump’s World The Changing Face of Direct Materials 3-D Printing's Next Frontier? A New Process Takes Shape with the Help of BMW, Delphi, Ford This may not be a safe assumption, because Apple can order components in massive quantities, securing the lowest prices. Google can’t make the same volume promises to suppliers, but the company’s new hardware executives say they’re aiming to accumulate such supply chain heft in the future. Jason Bremner, vice president of product management at Google, said last month that if suppliers know you’re going to be around for years and ordering lots of components, they’re more willing to work on new designs suited to your needs. One of the key features of the Pixel XL is its camera system, a single sensor module that takes 12 megapixel photos with the back camera and 8 megapixel shots with the front sensor. IHS estimates a total camera component cost in the Pixel XL of $17.50, which is less than the estimate of $19 for the iPhone 7’s camera system, which has similar capabilities. The priciest component inside of the Pixel XL is its 5.5-inch AMOLED QHD display by Samsung Electronics Co., coming in at $58 per unit, according to the IHS analysis. At $50 per unit is Qualcomm Inc.’s Snapdragon system-on-a-chip, the brains of the device. Like Apple, Google has tapped NXP Inc. for the phone’s near-field-communication payments chip and Samsung for storage. “All these different companies, not just Apple and Samsung, can make good hardware choices as hardware components have become commoditized,” Rassweiler said. “The difference here is Google looking to integrate its hardware and software which Apple has specialized in for years.” Love tech? Keep up with the manufacturing technology world with the M&T Newsletter, in your inbox every Friday morning Google’s internal development costs as well as the price to build the features on top of the Android operating system aren’t reflected in the cost analysis. Similar to Apple’s relationship with Foxconn, HTC Corp. is the final assembler of the Pixel phone. While HTC has experience building its own phones, Google executives said they were responsible for the Pixel’s supply chain, design, and engineering. “I’d say it is likely that Google is very involved in the design of this; HTC in this case is really a provider just the way as Foxconn is to Apple,” Rassweiler said.

Doctor Strange’s New York townhouse can be found through Google Maps By Joe Blevins@joe_a_blevins Oct 25, 2016 5:00 PM Doctor Strange (Screenshot: YouTube) Doctor Strange (Screenshot: YouTube) Share Tweet Anyone wishing to pay a visit to Doctor Strange before his movie opens on November 4 is in luck today. Just type his address (177A Bleecker Street, New York, New York 10012) into Google Maps and see what happens. At first, nothing unusual appears. Bleecker Grocery & Convenience, a real-life, disappointingly non-magical business, pops up automatically onscreen. But scroll down through Google’s list of places at this general location. Below the grocery store and a hotel called Caesar’s Palace, there is a third option: Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum. In Marvel lore, this imposing, three-story brownstone is the residence of the cape-wearing, mustachioed occultist of comic-book fame. It’s interesting to find out that Benedict Cumberbatch’s character lives just a short distance from The Comedy Cellar (as seen on Louie) and Saigon Shack, in case he finds himself in need of entertainment or sustenance. Apparently, this little Google Maps easter egg has been attracting the attention of some hardcore comics nerds lately, even though neither Google nor Marvel has really been promoting it. Some fans have even left reviews. Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum (Screenshot: Google Maps) It’s significant that Doctor Strange should have a realistic, searchable address. When he debuted in the pages of Strange Tales in 1963, Marvel was in the midst of building a superhero empire that was distinct from that of its main rival, DC Comics. Marvel wanted its characters, even the ones with superhuman and supernatural powers, to be grounded in some kind of reality. That meant giving them flawed personalities, complicated private lives, and identifiable locations. Rather than setting its tales in made-up places like Metropolis or Gotham, Marvel often opted for using true-to-life locations in New York City. A half century ago, it was actually kind of edgy for a superhero to live in Greenwich Village, then teeming with bohemians. In fact, Marvel writers Roy Thomas and Gary Friedrich once shared an apartment at the very location now said to be the site of the Sanctum.

Another 380 web addresses, or URLs, on the site, run by a subsidiary of Google, are in the process of being blocked, said a government official responsible for monitoring and blocking inappropriate content online. The source said the government was also planning to invite representatives of Facebook this week to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation in blocking users that post content or comments insulting the monarchy. "Approximately 30-40 URLs with inappropriate content have been blocked per day since last week, compared with an average of two to 10 before we started working together," the source said. Last Friday, Ann Lavin, director of public policy and government affairs at Google's Southeast Asia and Greater China office, met Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong to discuss the issue. The source said Google had put in place steps making it easier for the government to complain about YouTube posts considered offensive to the monarchy. Google employees in the US consider the requests. The effort includes a complaint report from the government available in Thai rather than only in English, as with previous versions. Google indicated it had Thai nationals to handle complaints around the clock. The source said the government has to send URLs with inappropriate content to Google's office in the US for review. It must also seek court orders in Thailand. The cooperation benefits the government because it shortens the process of blocking web addresses, the source said. It also helps avoid misunderstandings between the government and Google on what will be categorised as inappropriate content. "The government needs strong assistance from Google to permanently remove all the web addresses showing inappropriate videos on YouTube," the source said. Google spokesmen have insisted they have made no changes to their policies, which allow for site-blocking and YouTube video takedowns after considering government requests on a case-by-case basis. The company on Wednesday evening clarified the above statement that "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world. We have not changed those policies in Thailand.  We rely on governments around the world to notify us of content that they believe is illegal through official processes, and will restrict it as appropriate after a thorough review. All of these requests are tracked and included in our Transparency Report."   Earlier, ACM Prajin said the government was monitoring and tracking 100 people either posting or making comments with inappropriate content insulting the monarchy online. The government also set up yet another "war room" to monitor and block inappropriate web addresses 24 hours a day by working with the two state-run Cyber Security Operation Centres. ACM Prajin did not mention another new self-styled monitoring centre at the headquarters of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC). On Tuesday, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha  asked the public to refrain from quarrels and let the lese majeste law do its job. Some netizens have turned angry after seeing online messages that allegedly defame the monarch. Others have criticised the censorship. Gen Prayut advised people not to use emotions to judge what they see. If they find any act to be insulting, they should first look into the reasons behind it. If it turns out that the action was ill-intended, they should let officers deal with the issue, he said. The Foreign Ministry will arrange extradition requests to other countries where suspects under Section 112 of the Criminal Code -- better known as the lese majeste law -- have fled, Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said. Following the Justice Ministry's recent move to send letters asking authorities in other countries to extradite suspects whose posts breached Section 112, Mr Don said the ministry will help get the letters to these authorities. "We can ask for cooperation [from other countries]," he said.

INVENTIONS Google Reportedly Creating an Augmented Reality Headset That Tracks Your Eyes The company just purchased a startup that specializes in the technology. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a reporter for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Reporter, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT Google's Daydream View headset. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Earlier this month, Google unveiled Daydream View, its new $79 virtual reality headset that will launch next month. But apparently the company has more under development where that come from. In July, reports revealed that Google was developing a higher-end headset. According to a new report from Engadget, the headset won't use remotes or joysticks--it will be controlled by the wearer's eye movements. And on Monday, tech startup Eyefluence, which is developing eye-tracking technology, announced on its site that Google has acquired the company. Google's new headset reportedly will give wearers a view of the world around them, which means it falls under the realm of augmented reality. This is in contrast to the virtual reality Daydream View headset, which creates the illusion of an entirely artificial environment around the user. Also unlike the View, the new headset will be standalone and won't require the use of a computer or smartphone to operate. Google hasn't yet confirmed how it will use Eyefluence's technology. Neither company immediately responded to Inc.'s requests for comment. Given what's already known about the headset, though, it seems logical that the startup's eye-tracking abilities might play a role in the new headset. The news suggests Google is looking to enter the same ring occupied by the Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality headset that's still in development, as well as secretive AR startup Magic Leap. Interestingly, Google led a $542 million funding round in for the latter company, which still hasn't publicly shown its technology, in 2014. Fove, a VR startup with eye-tracking technology, recently raised nearly $500,000 on Kickstarter. That company will begin taking pre-orders for its headsets next month. The headset would be Google's latest venture into hardware. The Pixel phone was released October 20, and Daydream View and Google Home will launch November 4. Google Glass, the company's previous attempt at augmented reality, was widely considered a flop and has been sent back to the lab for revamping. Parent company Alphabet is making serious efforts to diversify its cash streams, as 90 percent of its revenue currently comes from ad sales via Google's search feature.

Brittany A. Roston - Oct 25, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Amazon Prime has long been the consumer’s best option for getting items from tons of retailers straight to their door, but Google has been treading on that territory, and now things are heating up. Now that Google Express has expanded to cover 90-percent of the U.S., more people than ever have the service as an online shopping option. Most people aren’t going to sign up for both services, though, which begs the question: which is better? Disclaimer: I’ve been an Amazon user for the better part of ten years, and I view my Amazon Prime membership very highly. That doesn’t mean I won’t look elsewhere if a better opportunity arises, though, and that’s why this new Google Express expansion has me intrigued. Can Google successfully draw in existing Prime subscribers? The answer is yes and no, but probably not. Amazon Prime Video is the Netflix You Used to Know That doesn’t mean Google Express isn’t the better solution for some people, though, so bear with me. After poking through the Google Express details, it has become readily apparent that, while similar in some ways, Google Express and Amazon Prime are two very different things, and so they’re going to appeal to two different groups of people. What are the differences? Amazon is a little bit of everything If you hate shopping at regular stores and buy almost everything online — usually in small batches and often spontaneously — then Amazon Prime is still your best solution. You get free two-day shipping. Items from a bunch of different retailers are all jammed in the same box. There’s no minimum required. It’s a very hands-off and lazy way to shop, and that’s really great. Google Express is for retailer loyalists For many people, shopping on Amazon means choosing items based on reviews and price, not necessarily brand or retailer. It’s a bit different with Google Express. The company has a bunch of retailers on board, and the stuff you order from any given one of them is its own thing. If you’re not getting the $95/year or $10/month plan, you’ll be looking at $5-per-shipment per retailer, which means things’ll get pricey if you’re wanting to spread beyond a single store. Shipping rates can also get a bit tricksy when ineligible/eligible come into play. Amazon Prime has more to offer Amazon Prime simply has more to offer than Google Express, making it more of a one-stop-shop for all of your needs…and I’m not talking about product selections. Rather, an Amazon Prime subscription gets you access to Amazon Music, eliminating the need for a separate music subscription. It also gets you access to Prime Video, which means you can skip Netflix or Hulu if you’re feeling so inclined. There’s also the free magazines and books you can now get with a Prime subscription, too. Overall, you’re getting a lot more for your money. Google Express is cheaper, but not really See the point above. Google noticeably undercut Amazon’s annual rate at $95 versus $99, but that’s not really a big deal, and in fact is quite a bit more pricey when you realize everything you lose in translation. That Amazon Prime annual rate doesn’t just get you two-day shipping and access to physical goods — it also gives you Amazon Music and Prime Video, not to mention the new Prime Reading perk. Assuming you use Prime Video and Amazon Music, that extra $4/year is more than worth it. Amazon is highly reliable Now this is subjective, but I’ve had very good experiences with Amazon’s reliability. A delayed shipment is a true rarity. I’ve ordered thousands of dollars’ worth of items from Amazon over the years, and have never had to return a single one. Amazon has been at it for a long time now and has its business down to a science. Google Express, at this point in time, is a much newer service and many reviews of it from recent months reflect this: namely, many people have complained about delayed shipments sometimes taking four or five days to arrive rather than one or two. Google Express gives you a longer trial, faster shipments If you’re just in it for the free trial, Google Express is the better option, as you get three months to make up your mind versus 30 days. As well, you’ll also get one-day shipping on certain eligible orders through Google Express, whereas the ordinary Prime member who isn’t in a Prime Now supported region is stuck with two-day shipping. So if you really hate waiting, Google Express may be more satisfying at times. Conclusion At the end of the day, Google Express may be the better option for you if for no other reason than it includes your favorite retailer. If that’s the case, by all means use it. Be sure to consider how often you’re going to use it when choosing between the individual/monthly/yearly rate options to avoid wasting money. If, however, you’re looking for a way to drastically reduce how often you step foot in stores, Amazon Prime is still your best option. You simply get access to more items, both in terms of product selection and services. If you’re going to spend a hundred dollars a year, you might as well choose the option that includes books, magazines, video and music, too.

October 25, 2016 - Business - Tagged: ra_business, Social media, Verizon LOS ANGELES – Wall Street gave a cool reception Monday to AT&T’s plan to buy Time Warner Inc., illustrating sharply divergent views on whether the blockbuster deal will usher in a new era of media consolidation or merely more scrutiny from federal regulators. But the uncertainty didn’t stop some analysts from speculating about various combinations that could transform the media business – tantalizing pairings of tech giants with studios, and cable companies with wireless carriers. A motivator for more deal-making: survival. Traditional media companies are girding for battle with tech powerhouses Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.com. Amazon and Netflix already have made aggressive moves into producing Hollywood content. “Overall, we believe we are likely one more deal away from potentially reshaping the landscape for at least a decade,” Barclay’s Equity Research analyst Kannan Venkateshwar wrote in a Monday report. “We are in the midst of a great convergence cycle, which is likely to impact business models for years to come.” AT&T’s top executive said Monday that he didn’t want his Dallas company to get trampled in the stampede. “The convergence in terms of media and distribution is moving fast,” AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told analysts in a conference call. “We want to be at the front of it. We don’t want to be chasing it.” Analysts were split on whether AT&T’s move would spur other companies to combine. Several attributed AT&T’s play as a way to position itself as a more robust competitor to Google and Facebook, which capture the lion’s share of online advertising, and Amazon and Apple, which have strong customer relations. “These are the big bullies on the playground now,” said Laura Martin, a managing director at Needham & Co. “And AT&T will be roughly the same size if it is allowed to buy Time Warner.” Some observers believe that another cellphone giant, Verizon Communications, might be interested in buying CBS and Viacom to bulk up in a similar way that AT&T is trying to do with its acquisition of Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN, TBS and Hollywood’s largest film and television studio, Warner Bros. CBS Corp. is mulling whether to recombine with Viacom Inc., which owns Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures – a marriage proposed by the controlling shareholder family of Sumner Redstone. Viacom and CBS were part of the same company until Redstone divided his empire in 2006 to untangle the assets that he had spent years putting together. Tech giants like Apple, Google and Amazon are seen as likely players in the entertainment industry and could be interested in buying content firms. Apple and Google were even rumored as possible alternative bidders for Time Warner. Many have speculated that Apple Inc., which is sitting on more than $200 billion in cash, might buy a content company to jump start its Apple TV service. Amazon, the Seattle-based e-commerce giant, has invested heavily in creating its own original TV shows and movies for its Prime streaming service. Meanwhile, Google’s hugely popular YouTube is ramping up original video content for its Red subscriptions service. One of the biggest question marks is Walt Disney Co.’s next move. The conglomerate’s growth over the last decade has been largely fueled by the addition of such juggernaut properties as Pixar Animation, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm. This summer, Disney paid $1 billion for a stake in BamTech, the technology company created by Major League Baseball that builds streaming services. Analysts believe that Disney is keenly interested in diversifying distribution channels because its profit engine, ESPN, has lost millions of subscribers as more consumers trim or ditch their pay-TV bundles. At an investor conference last month, Chief Executive Robert Iger described BamTech as “a great way for us to move ESPN and probably other Disney assets onto digital mobile platforms in a more effective way.” This fall, Disney looked at buying social messaging service Twitter but took a pass. “If they did make any move into distribution, Netflix would be the way to do it,” said Scott Krisiloff, chief investment officer at Avondale Asset Management, which is not an investor in Disney. “That’s something I could see Disney doing.” Disney, Netflix, CBS and Viacom declined to comment. Streaming service Netflix has been a darling of Wall Street because of its rapid growth in subscribers, but that also makes the company more expensive for a potential buyer. Netflix’s market capitalization is $55 billion. Should AT&T be successful in gobbling up Time Warner, it could encourage cable giants like Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications to pursue deals with mobile carriers like T-Mobile or Sprint, said Matthew Harrigan, media analyst for Wunderlich Securities. The AT&T-Time Warner deal “could make it more imperative for Comcast to have a robust mobile offering,” Harrigan said. Comcast, which acquired NBCUniversal five years ago, and Charter, which bought Time Warner Cable in May, have already announced their intentions of seguing into the wireless carrier space. Comcast plans next year to begin offering a branded cellphone service within its current service areas. It has an agreement with Verizon to use its wireless network for the planned service. However, Harrigan and other analysts don’t expect a wave of deals to acquire big content companies because there aren’t that many attractive options available. Some media companies such as 21st Century Fox are owned by families who would be loathe to relinquish them. Lionsgate, the studio best known for “The Hunger Games” film franchise, could be a logical purchase for anyone looking to own more movie and television content. The studio has a growing TV production business. Lionsgate’s stock has fallen about 48 percent in the last year, thanks to a rocky film slate, and the company is in the process of buying cable channel Starz for $4.4 billion – which could make it more difficult to swallow. Sony Pictures, owned by Japanese technology giant Sony Corp., has also been mentioned as a target for a tech company or a Chinese firm. (China’s Dalian Wanda Group wanted to buy a large stake in Viacom’s Paramount Pictures before Sumner and Shari Redstone said no.) Though it has struggled at the box office, Sony has valuable movie franchises such as “Spider-Man” and James Bond, and makes popular TV shows including “The Blacklist” and “Shark Tank.” Nonetheless, Sony Corp. CEO Kazuo Hirai has insisted he is not looking to sell the operation. “The studio is an important driver of future growth for Sony, and it has for years been the cornerstone of Sony’s value-chain strategy,” Hirai told Worldscreen, an international TV trade magazine, this month. Smaller players like Discovery Communications, Scripps Networks Interactive, which owns HGTV and Food Network, and AMC Networks Inc., which boasts “The Walking Dead,” often are considered takeover candidates, but none would be nearly as big of a coup as acquiring Time Warner.

Most Popular Google's Jamboard costs about $6,000. Credit: Google Oh, great, now everyone's going be having "Jam" sessions, aren't they? Google is inviting companies to get on the waiting list for its latest in-office tool called the Jamboard. It's a digital whiteboard that could make workers long for the days when PowerPoint presentations were all they had to worry about. That means offices could start hearing, "Hey, let's Jam," or "Wanna Jam storm." Funny name aside, Google's new tech toy does look slick. It has a 55-inch, 4K resolution screen that syncs with Google's G-Suite office products, and it connects to the internet to share with remote offices. Google said the Jamboard has only been available to select early partners like Spotify and Netflix. The board costs less than $6,000, which makes it cheaper than Microsoft's Surface Hub at $9,000. Still, Google does not have the best track record with quirky new gadgets -- think, Glass -- so Jamboards might not necessarily invade Madison Avenue. If it does, everyone could be in a Jam.

The new integration between Google Calendar and QuickBooks Online means that QuickBooks users can schedule client work periods and appointments in the calendar and see them automatically available in QuickBooks when it comes time to invoice customers and balance the books. This saves the steps of manually entering any calendar information into QuickBooks for users that rely on the accounting software for sending invoices or managing finances. Intuit says that this new feature is the first step of a collaboration with Google that will see more integrations in the future. Since 56 per cent of QuickBooks customers use Google Calendar, it’s clear why the partnership makes sense. A video posted to the QuickBooks Youtube account explains the new tie-in: Another immediate new feature of Intuit’s collaboration with Google is a single sign-on for users of G Suite and QuickBooks. G Suite, formerly Google for Work, will now allow QuickBooks users to access their account without typing in a separate login. Signing up for a new QuickBooks account is also easier, since G Suite users can just port over their profile data from Google to get started. QuickBooks is also available for download from the G Suite Marketplace. While the new Google Calendar for QuickBooks integration is currently available as a public beta in the U.S., it’s restricted to a private beta in Canada at the moment. The feature is only available to users of QuickBooks Plus.

This is according to the BoM experts at IHS, who have released their report regarding Google's smartphone today. This, however, does not mean that the entire difference from $285.75 to the $769 selling price for this model is pure profit for Google - software, R&D and marketing costs are never included in BoM calculations. For comparison, take into account the fact that Samsung's Galaxy S7 costs $255 to make, while the iPhone 7's BoM amounts to $224.80. Both of those devices are smaller than the Pixel XL, and thus have smaller (and cheaper) displays and batteries. Their enclosures could also be cheaper thanks to the reduced size compared to the Pixel XL. The most expensive single component in Google's flagship is the display assembly, with the Samsung-made AMOLED panel and Gorilla Glass 4 on top. This is priced at $58. On the other hand, the company getting the most cash from Google for Pixel XL components on the whole might be Qualcomm - $50 for the SoC, but also a big part of the $19.50 that the RF parts are estimated to cost, as well as $11 for power management components and a fraction of $15.50 for the audio codec. Samsung isn't just supplying the display for the phone, its UFS 2.0 NAND storage also comes from the Korean company. Unfortunately we don't know exactly how much this costs since it's lumped together with the SK Hynix-made RAM in the IHS report - the two memory components together are priced at $26.50. The handset's 3,450 mAh battery is made by LG Chem and costs $4. The cameras together are priced at $17.50, while the Pixel XL's enclosure is estimated to cost $35. Finally, the stuff that comes in the box alongside the phone (charger, cables, documentation) costs $10 in total.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (7) Post your comment Google's Jamboard is an Android-powered 55-inch 4K whiteboard 25 October 2016 Today Google is announcing a new device, which basically looks like its answer to Microsoft's Surface Hub. The latter is a touchscreen PC (available in two sizes, the smaller of which is 55") running Windows 10. Google's offering is called Jamboard, and it's running Android. It's got a 55-inch 4K touchscreen, and will come with a special whiteboard app preinstalled. As with the Surface Hub, the Jamboard is aimed at businesses, in this case those who already use G Suite (that's what Google Apps are now called). The screen can handle 16 simultaneous touch inputs, and comes with a stylus, a camera, Wi-Fi, and built-in speakers. G Suite users will be able to create "Jam" sessions on it, collaborating on documents, as well as drawing or typing over them while engaged in Hangouts calls. The Jamboard even lets you "wipe" off things from it with your fingers. Additional tools include sticky notes, stencils, and handwriting recognition. All that said, Google hasn't shared any details about the Jamboard's innards. It can be mounted as a TV or used on a stand with wheels (that you can see in the images above). This will make moving it within your company hassle-free. The Jamboard will become available at some point next year for "under $6,000". That makes it significantly cheaper than Microsoft's Surface Hub, which starts at $8,999.

Some early buyers are now being told by Google that units won’t ship until mid-November due to the initial pre-order demand exceeding expectations. In the Google Store Order history, many buyers are still listed as ‘Pre-ordered’ or ‘Pending.’ This is in spite of estimated delivery dates being listed as early as this week. Some with delivery windows beginning yesterday are still in this stage and have yet to be charged for their purchase. Contacting the Google Store does not provide any more guidance, with support representatives saying that customers will receive their devices by the estimated date. Specifically, some reps are saying to ignore the online page and trust that their device will be delivered as promised. With Google Store pre-orders selling out early, some turned to Project Fi in order to get their devices earlier. I personally encountered an issue with the ‘Buy Devices‘ page that said orders for a particular unit would ship out at a specific date, only to have that turn out not to be the case. Speaking to Fi support, I was told that the “shipping department is running 3 weeks behind” and as a result the new ship date is Nov 18 and not the currently listed Oct 27-31 date for me. In a statement, Google says “pre-order demand has exceeded our expectations,” but does not comment on the mismatch between what is stated in the Order history page and what support representatives are now telling some people. Google’s full statement is below: We’re thrilled to see the excitement for our new Pixel phones, and frankly pre-order demand has exceeded our expectations. We’re working to restock our inventory as soon as possible.

Elyse Betters25 October 2016Gadgets Google Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google has introduced a new product called Jamboard. You probably won't need this thing unless you're a teacher or a company executive, because it's a powerful collaboration tool used to enhance meetings or presentations. It provides a whiteboard experience, but it's all about "moving the whiteboard to the cloud", according to Google. Here's everything you need to know about Google Jamboard. What is Google Jamboard? Google Jamboard is a whiteboard-like 4K touch display you can use for meetings and presentation purposes. Turn it on, draw on it, flip through slides on it, whatever. Google plans to make Jamboard part of its G Suite, so users will be able to directly access and edit Docs, Sheets, Slides, and photos stored in Drive. There are no plans to make these apps run natively right now, as they'll use companion apps that let you and your teammates "jam". When you “jam” with your teammates, whether that includes sketching, adding images, writing notes, pulling from the web, etc, your work lives in the cloud in Google Drive, where you can easily share what you’ve created or edit it at anytime. You can work with teammates from across the world using Google Hangouts and Google Cast for setting up broadcasts and collaborations, or you can work remotely using the companion app. What does Google Jamboard feature? Google The Jamboard has a "plug-and-play" design with no batteries or charging. It features a 55-inch 60Hz Ultra HD 4K touch display (supports passive stylus and finger recognition, with 16-touch points), a built-in wide-angle HD camera, mic, speakers, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, USB Type C, HDMI 2.0, Bluetooth, NFC, and Wi-Fi. It also runs a variant of Android Marshmallow. Google has not yet disclosed which processor is inside. Google Jamboard appears to come with a thick white stylus for drawing and another white, mouse-like device that acts like an eraser. How is Jamboard different from Surface Hub? Microsoft Microsoft unveiled a similar product, called Surface Hub, in 2015 and began shipping it in 2016. The 55-inch Surface Hub model starts at $9,000. In October, Microsoft said it shipped Surface Hubs to 600 customers worldwide. The device runs a custom version of Windows 10, offers custom versions of OneNote, Skype for Business, and Microsoft's Office apps, and can download custom apps from the Windows Store for Business. The Surface Hub also comes in an 84-inch model. While the 55-inch model features an Intel Core i5 processor, the larger model has an i7 processor. Both models offer a display with 100 multi-touch points. Other Surface Hub specs include two wide-angle cameras, mics, speakers, Wi-Fi, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Ethernet 1000 Base T, 128GB of storage with 8GB RAM, and two powered pens. Unlike Surface Hub, you can’t install any third-party apps on the Google Jamboard. But it does come with a companion app, which will be available for Android and iOS, allowing users to work on the whiteboard in real-time. The Surface Hub doesn't have companion apps, but you can collaborate on via Skype for Business. Surface Hub is positioned as a standalone touch-computing device, while Jamboard is a touch display. When will Google Jamboard be available? Google opened applications for Early Adopter versions of Jamboard on 25 October, allowing select applicants to receive Jamboards by late October/early November. Google's estimated ship target for Jamboard is the first half of 2017. How much does Google Jamboard cost? Google said Jamboard will be "competitively priced" at under $6,000 USD. Surface Hub starts at $9,000 and goes up to $21,999.

Learn where it's hiding and how to put it to use. How to find and use a Chromebook's local storage 0 Share: Computers by Matt Elliott October 25, 2016 1:30 PM PDT @themattelliott Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Chromebooks are built and sold with the idea that you'll use cloud storage for most if not all of your files. A Chromebook's files are likely stored on Google Drive. Music is likely played on Google Play. Photos are likely viewed on Google Photos. (Or alternative cloud services such as, say, Dropbox, Spotify and Flickr.) This web-centric view of the laptop makes Chromebooks easy to operate and inexpensive to acquire, but Chromebooks are not without some local storage. Typically, a Chromebook supplies either a 16GB or 32GB solid-state drive, but ChromeOS treats this local storage as a cache and may delete older files to make room for new files. I wouldn't keep the only copies of treasured photos on my Chromebook's SSD, but it is useful as a temporary storage spot for downloaded files. (For example, to set a custom image for your desktop wallpaper, you first need to download an image from the Web.) Because local storage is deemphasized on a Chromebook, finding it isn't as straightforward as locating your C: drive. With this guide, I'll show you how to access your Chromebook's local storage, find out how much free space remains and how to save, delete and move files. Find your Chromebook's local storage To view the files stored locally on your Chromebook, click the Launcher button in the lower-left corner of your Chromebook's display (it's ChromeOS' version of the Windows Start button). A window will open showing the apps you have used recently. Look for the Files app. If you don't see it, click All Apps and find the Files app listed among all of your Chromebook's apps. Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Matt Elliott/CNET From the Files window, click Downloads from the left panel. The files in this Downloads folder are stored locally on your Chromebook. Find out how much free storage remains To see how much of your meager allotment of local storage remains free, open the Downloads folder and then click the triple-dot button in the upper-right corner. This opens a small panel that show's how many GBs you have left. Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Matt Elliott/CNET How to save files Any file you download from the Web to a Chromebook gets saved to your Downloads folder. If you find an image online you want to save, for example, you can right-click on the image and choose Save image as and it gets saved to the Downloads folder. How to delete files To delete a file, open the Downloads folder, click to select a file or files and then click the trashcan button in the upper-right corner. How to move files to the cloud Instead of deleting a file, you can free up local storage space by moving a file from the Downloads folder to the cloud. Actually, you can't move it as much as copy it and then go back and delete it. From the Downloads folder, click on a file and drag it to Google Drive listed in the left panel. This copies the file to Google Drive, leaving the original in the Downloads folder. But once you have copied it to Google Drive, you can then go back and delete it from the Downloads folder to free up your local storage.

After the “issue” has resulted in numerous hardware returns/exchanges, Google is now chiming in on the issue. First off, the halo effect is real. Google has finally confirmed that, yes, the Pixel does exhibit a fair amount of lens flaring (significantly more than you may be used to from other devices) and that it’s something that affects every Pixel — whether you’ve yet to run into the issue or not — so a hardware exchange wont resolve anything. Photos taken with the iPhone 7, Pixel, Honor 8 show halo arc only present on Pixel In a post from the Pixel User Community, a Googler flat out confirms that the Pixel “has a little too much of the ‘halo/arc’ flare” but they’re already working on a fix. No, there’s not going to be a global recall (heh). Instead, Google says a future software update — arriving in the next few weeks — will help alleviate the appearance of the halo/light arc in photos. Using new algorithms to identify the halo, Google believes they’ll be able to eliminate it from photos, almost like a quick PhotoShop job being done on the fly. Of course, you’ll need to be using HDR+ Auto for it to work, although we’re not sure what that means for video, where the halo arc also appears, but isn’t quite as noticeable. I’m also not entirely confident software will completely erase the halo arc from photos 100%, but at the very least it should help minimize it for much better results. As you already know, Google’s uses a lot of software tricks in its camera software to help with things like HDR+ and even image stabilization when shooting video. Being able to fix a hardware “issue” using software only further showcases the power of Google’s computational photography and according to Google, is just the beginning of how they expect the Pixel camera to grow better over time.

Google’s rumored wireless VR headset will not require a connected PC or smartphone in order to function and the platform is reportedly separate and distinct from Google’s Daydream View virtual reality headgear, which launches in November. Related: Hands On: Google Daydream View News of the Eyefluence buyout arrived shortly after Engadget published a report indicating Google’s rumored wireless VR gear “will integrate eye tracking and use sensors and algorithms to map out the real-world space in front of a user.” Further evidence that such a headset is close to reality can be found in FCC application for a new prototype device with wireless capability from Google. There isn’t much detail in the filing, but it does appear to be VR-related. Mike Jazayeri is listed as a contact and he currently is part of the leadership of Google’s VR team. Citing “people familiar with the matter,” Engadget reports Google’s in-development headset will focus on augmented reality within a user’s field of vision, eliminating the need for a tethered PC or mobile device. Google declined to comment — the FCC application also asks for “confidential treatment” of its FCC filings, a move meant to prevent unintentional disclosure of a company’s work through publicly available filings. Founded in 2013, Eyefluence offers eye-tracking software that can be integrated with head-mounted VR and AR displays. The company notes its technology is powered by “over a decade of eye studies, algorithm development, optics and illumination system design, and field applications.” Given Eyefluence’s capabilities, Google’s rumored VR device could feature augmented reality technology similar to Microsoft’s HoloLens peripheral. Google previously contributed to an initial venture funding round for Magic Leap, developer of a head-mounted VR display that projects 3D imagery on top of real-world objects and settings. “Over the last three and a half years we have built an incredible team, advanced our eye-interaction technology, and created strong partnerships that have lead to the development of a completely new language for eye-interaction,” Eyefluence said in a statement following this week’s Google acquisition. “We are excited to announce that the Eyefluence team is joining Google! With our forces combined, we will continue to advance eye-interaction technology to expand human potential and empathy on an even larger scale. We look forward to the life-changing innovations we’ll create together!” Ed Oswald contributed to this report.

That's far less than the typical big bundle of channels on cable, which a recent survey from Leichtman Research Group says costs about $100, on average.  But it's comparable to the price of Dish Network's Sling TV streaming service, which, granted, has fewer channels at that price.  AT&T says the streaming service with more than 100 popular TV channels that's coming out next month will cost $35 a month. That's far less than the typical big bundle of channels on cable, which a recent survey from Leichtman Research Group says costs about $100, on average. THE INTERNET TV WARS  Earlier this year, Hulu said today it will offer a live-streaming service in 2017 that will offer a mix of cable and broadcast programming as well as news, sports and events. That pits the streaming service against similar offerings from Dish's Sling TV and Sony's PlayStation Vue as more and more Americans shift to watching TV online. Earlier this week, it was claimed Google has signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels  Apple is also believed to be developing a similar service.  It is $20 cheaper than Sony's PlayStation Vue streaming service tier with a similar number of channels. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson announced the pricing of the streaming service, called DirecTV Now, at the WSJ.D conference while onstage with Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes. Dallas-based AT&T is buying HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. owner Time Warner for $85.4 billion.  The phone company bought satellite TV company DirecTV last year. Stephenson said AT&T would try to keep the streaming service's price in check through new advertising models.  It's meant to attract the millions of people who have cut cable in recent years or never subscribed to a cable service at all.  Many of those are thought to be ages 35 and younger.

Share this article Share 11 shares Earlier this week, it was claimed Google has signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday. The service, which will be part of Google's YouTube Platform, is expected to launch early next year and will include all of CBS' content, including live NFL games, one of the sources said. Google's 'skinny' bundle will cost $25 to $40 a month, the source said. According to the Wall Street Journal, the service will be called Unplugged.  NETFLIX STORMS TO SUCCESS WITH STRANGER THINGS  Netflix added many more subscribers in the third quarter than analysts expected as new original shows such as 'Stranger Things' kept users hooked to the service, sending the company's shares up 19 percent in extended trading on Monday. The company, which had reported disappointing subscription growth for the last two quarters, forecast current-quarter subscriptions that blew past analysts' expectations. Netflix added about 3.20 million subscribers internationally in the third quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of 2.01 million. It is unclear which Fox and Viacom networks would be part of the Google service, two of the sources said. The sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential.  However, the Wall Street journal said 'Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network.  '21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.'

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

News Directory Competitions Events Newsletter Map Follow Contact Jamboard: The Whiteboard, Reimagined for Collaboration in the Cloud Oct 25, 2016 3:54 pm 35 With all the technological advances that make it easy for a global workforce to stay connected, there is still no seamless way to brainstorm across teams or offices. To solve this, Google commissioned aruliden to help design a fully integrated, hardware and software solution, a product that inspires creativity yet is adaptable to a variety of environments. Today, together with Google's TJ Varghese, aruliden unveiled Jamboard, an innovative creative collaboration whiteboard designed for today's dynamic workplace. Jamboard brings all the familiarity of collaborating on a whiteboard to an increasingly remote workforce. With Jamboard, teams can jot down ideas, sketch out plans or frame up an idea in seconds, and collaborate in real-time with co-workers across the globe. Jamboard The magic in Jamboard is that it brings human touch to a digital experience. The gestural cues that Jamboard integrates allows users to interact with the product just as they would with a whiteboard; the interface does not detract from the creative experience as some technology can, but instead enhances it. Draw with a stylus, erase with your hand, move images with a swipe. The hardware is thoughtfully designed for the space that it lives in and the functionality it offers, offering a sleek aesthetic that fits easily in any workspace. To complement the Jamboard are familiar instruments that break down the barrier of technology, such as a digital eraser that behaves like an analog one, as well as a stylus with a form factor inspired by daily tools, making the product more accessible and usable by all. Jamboard is an exciting new way to bridge the gap between analog and digital for the creative industries. There's a friendly, approachable design that speaks to both the Google brand and the creative process, which makes it accessible and easy to use. Jamboard marries all the magic from G Suite into a physical hardware solution, built to let teams foster creativity and brainstorm freely.

The product is called 'Jamboard,' an allusion to its goal of replacing the physical whiteboards that companies have been setting up in meeting rooms for decades.  It boasts a 55-inch, ultrahigh-definition screen capable of recognizing the difference between when someone is writing on it with a stylus or touching it with a finger. Scroll down for video  This image provided by Google shows a demonstration of the company's new product called 'Jamboard.' Google has designed the giant touch-screen canvas for companies trying to make it easier for their employees to brainstorm as they work on team projects and other assignments. Google is releasing the device to a small group of companies Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, before making it widely available in early 2017. (Google via AP) HOW IT WORKS  As with a whiteboard, employees can post their ideas, documents and images on the Jamboard, only they won't need markers, tape or sticky notes to do it.  Instead, they can use their fingers, a stylus or smartphones and smaller tablets to share information and content from anywhere with an online connection.  All the work posted on a Jamboard can be saved in Google's online storage service, Drive.

Jamboard represents Google's latest effort to lure business and government customers away from Microsoft, which makes a similar product called the Surface Hub.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Is a genetically engineered virus the answer to alcoholism?...

Share this article Share 21 shares Google is undercutting Microsoft by pricing Jamboard at about $6,000, a 33 percent markdown from the $9,000 Surface Hub. Using Jamboard will require a subscription to Google's G Suite of email and other business applications, a service that starts at $5 per month. Jamboard reinforces Google's push to make its own gear in an attempt to hook more people on its software and other digital services.  Until this fall, Google had teamed up with other manufacturers whenever it made a phone or other gadget. The Jamboard comes with two pens, and a digital eraser - but fingers can also be used But Google just rolled out a fancy smartphone called the Pixel that it designed itself. Soon it will start selling an internet-connected speaker called Home.  Both those devices feature a digital assistant powered by Google's artificial-intelligence programs. Google is undercutting Microsoft by pricing Jamboard at about $6,000, a 33 percent markdown from the $9,000 Surface Hub. Jamboard operates with an application that works on smartphones and tablets powered either by Google's Android software or Apple's operating system for iPhones and Pads.  Jamboard won't work with Microsoft's Windows system, making it incompatible with Surface tablets and most personal computers.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant.

Eyefluence, which is working to enable eye movements to control digital screens, wrote in a blog post on Monday that it is joining the search giant and its parent company, Alphabet. The three-year-old start-up, which had reportedly raised US$21.6 million (S$30 million) in funding, did not disclose a price. Google confirmed the deal with Eyefluence in a statement. “In early 2013, our journey began with a mission to transform intent into action through your eyes. We recognised an opportunity to create a more natural, intuitive way to interact with augmented and virtual reality displays,” Eyefluence said in a blog post. “Today, we are excited to announce that the Eyefluence team is joining Google! With our forces combined, we will continue to advance eye-interaction technology to expand human potential and empathy on an even larger scale. We look forward to the life-changing innovations we’ll create together!” Mr Jim Marggraff, the creator of the pioneering LeapPad tablet computer, started Eyefluence after buying up assets from neurological research firm Eye-Com. He pledged that the start-up would allow people to manipulate objects and digital screens with their eye movements. Functional eye-tracking is a desired feature in virtual reality and augmented reality, which lets digital images interact with the physical world. Eye-tracking tech would curb some of the latency and accessibility issues that keep the nascent media to a niche fan base. Google has invested heavily in virtual reality, launching tailored software and introducing its own mobile headset earlier this month. Google’s Daydream View, which works with an Android phone, is cheaper than other options in the market. At US$79, the price is well below products from HTC and Facebook’s Oculus, which cost hundreds of dollars. Google has also invested directly in Magic Leap, a start-up that is also purportedly working on eye interaction technology.

Roston - Oct 25, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Not too long ago, Google Express ditched fresh grocery delivery plans, a move that has enabled it to make a huge expansion across the US. With this latest expansion, Google’s alternative to Amazon Prime now covers about 90-percent of the United States. The company has partnered with a bunch of well-known retailers to offer their goods, but what does all this mean for you? You’re not limited to Amazon Prime The biggest deal here is that many consumers have gained a very robust alternative to Amazon Prime. That’s not to say that Prime’s not a great service for some people, because it is. But not everyone wants to lay down Amazon’s $99/year fee, and perhaps excluding any regional services, this left many people with little or no significant online shopping options. Google Express changes that by offering tons of products from retailers with two subscription options: a slightly-undercutting-Amazon annual fee of $95/yr, or $10/month, or a flat $5/shipment rate (most of the time). It’s worth noting that the $5/shipment fee does apply to shipments per store rather than sum total, making it somewhat less appealing than Prime’s flat-rate $5.99/box Pantry option (assuming you’re ordering groceries, that is). You can order goods from your favorite store without leaving the house Google Express has partnered with tons of retailer across the nation to source its goods, including Costco, Kohl’s, Walgreens, The Vitamin Shoppe, Petsmart, and more. Click any one of these retailers within Google Express and you’ll see all the items available to order online. These include everything from pet food to gadgets, home and garden needs, health and beauty, baby items, and groceries, to name a few. Items arrive quickly Because the items you’re buying are more or less sourced from local places, you don’t have to wait too long to get your product. In some cases, they’ll show up at your home the day after you order them, though sometimes you’ll have to wait two days to get it. This is a slight benefit over Amazon Prime for those who aren’t covered by Prime Now, which can get things to customers in as little as a couple hours.

With the holidays just around the corner, many people are beginning to think about shopping--and for a lot of Memphians, that means online shopping. Just in time for the holidays, Google Express announced it is expanding its service to more areas, including Memphis. The expansion into 14 states will offer over 70 million more people access to two-day delivery when shopping at stores such as Costco, Whole Foods Market, PetSmart, Kohl's, and more.  Customers can shop online or with the app, check out, and get it delivered fast.  In addition, the ability to reorder products that were previously purchased is as simple as a tap of the button.  "Our goal with Google Express is to offer a great shopping experience and connect people with their favorite stores," Brian Elliott, General Manager of Google Express, said. "Today, we're very excited to be further expanding our efforts -- making it easy for millions in Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville -- and the majority of the population in Tennessee to get things they need from stores they love -- delivered fast." Beginning October 25, shoppers across Tennessee will have two options to enjoy delivery from their favorite local retailers through Google Express. There is a $95 membership fee for the service or you can pay-as-you-go with a minimum order of $4.99 per order. To learn more about the Google Express services, or to start shopping, click here.

KIMIHIRO HOSHINO/AFP/Getty Google’s Project Loon, a broadband by balloon service, seemed like its weirdest moonshot. It’s not. It turns out that it also has wind turbines on kites, which it calls Makani. It works by mounting turbines on gliders attached to a tether, which carries power down to the grid. Do either of these relate to pairing what people search for with relevant ads, the company’s fundamental business? Kind of. “Without getting into specifics, I assure you we are looking at very substantial opportunities for Loon—Google-scale opportunities,” Google exec Astro Teller told Conor Dougherty at the New York Times in February. A new 7,000 word report from CB Insights called “Google Strategy Teardown” explores how the company has worked to build on its strength today to remain relevant in the future. Assuming that more can be learned from how a company spends its money than what it says, CB Insights looks in detail at Google’s acquisitions and what’s happened to those acquisitions in the last five years or so. It paints a portrait of a company aware that its core business, ads on the internet, is under threat, but it can’t quite figure out what to do next. “Since 2001, [Google] has made nearly 200 acquisitions to bring on external talent and expand into new sectors, and in the process coined another tech adage in the form of Larry Page’s ‘toothbrush test‘ for whether an M&A target is worthy,” the report explains. CB Insights has built its business around keeping detailed records on investments and acquisitions, with data-driven analysis that investors are willing to pay for. By the way, Google is technically just a division of Alphabet. The company restructured itself this time last year under the new moniker. But since no one calls Google “Alphabet,” we’re going to call Alphabet “Google.” “Admittedly, it has been a short year since the birth of Alphabet, but the data thus far reflects the new organization’s attempt to balance moonshots with fiscal responsibility and clear paths to revenue,” CB Insights writes. ‘Mobile ads generally are also less lucrative than desktop ads, so Google’s success in mobile has been accompanied by a decline in cost-per-click’ Google has increasingly begun to pour money from its still profitable display advertising ventures into new lines, in the hope that one will become a runaway hit. Here are some key takeaways from CB Insights’ analysis:  Leaders keep quitting. “One can see that post-Alphabet, the loss of foundational figures is a theme that will resurface across our examination of the company’s other units,” the report writes. The visionary executives behind its venture capital, self-driving cars and robotics ventures have all moved on. Bill Maris has left Google Ventures. Chris Urmson (who the Observer reported on in the Spring) has left its self-driving car project. Andy Rubin quit overseeing its efforts in robotics.  Google wants to catch up on cloud. It is surprising that a company known for giant server farms got beat on cloud services. Amazon clearly leads the pack here, but other companies have carved strong niches for themselves. Mountain View appears to hope it can buy its way to somewhere closer to the front of the line. It spent $625 million earlier this year to buy Apigee, a company that makes it easier for developers to use cloud services. Both Apple and Spotify have taken contracts on Google servers, which is braggable. Display ads aren’t dead yet. One path to growth: get more people online more often. First, close the digital divide globally. “Projects Link, Skybender, and Loon are targeting wholly different demographics in remote areas and emerging markets, but they are clearly extensions of the same universal-broadband-access philosophy,” the report writes. Then, get people who are online, online more. Project Fi (its mobile-wi-fi hybrid), Google Fiber and even LinkNYC fit in here. Even though these last three operate in the developed world, they each get people to spend more time online. Both get more people seeing more display ads. Machine learning will help even if Google fails to own it. CB Insights makes a big deal out of Google’s efforts in artificial intelligence, but the main thing we got out of it was this: machine learning can make big systems more efficient (such as running servers or distributing autonomous vehicles), even if it turns out that Google fails to own the space. Patents. Anyone to whom conspiratorial analysis appeals will find CB Insights analysis of the company’s patents appealing. It counts up the words used in all the patents to see where its putting most of its inventive energy. One word appears again and again, from 2012 to the present: vehicle. Stay weird. Honestly, power-from-kites isn’t that strange from a strategic perspective. Google uses a lot of electricity and smart companies know that power from traditional sources has to get pricier. Commercial sustainable energy at scale would let the company fix the price for part of its energy costs. You know what is weird? Google buying into luxury hotel bookings and delivering burritos by drone. Those are weird. Google today in the CB Insights report sounds a lot like Microsoft during the early days of the Internet. Microsoft ruled the pre-internet era, with every PC maker licensing its Windows OS and usually Office as well. When the internet came along, it famously tried to force its subpar browser, Internet Explorer, on every user of a PC. Then it started chasing everyone else’s imitations, making its own MP3 player (the Zune) and its own console gaming system (the Xbox). Eventually, it even made its own search engine (Bing). As an aside, Microsoft seems have gotten its groove back, with its stock at an all time high as an enterprise cloud services company, but it also has a 20 year advantage on Mountain View. At least one decade of that lead time has since been pronounced a lost one by Kurt Eichenwald, writing in Vanity Fair. Today, Google is chasing Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud. It’s chasing Apple and Amazon in natural language assistants and home appliances. It’s also chasing Apple in devices. It’s leading in self-driving cars, probably, but it’s hard to say. ‘Each query handled through an Alexa- or Siri-driven device threatens the foundation of Google’s current revenue model’ Here at the Observer, we’ve criticized the search giant for its aggressive tracking of users. It was one thing when it just refined searches on what people were searching for, but it has since undermined end-to-end encryption for personal communication and it literally follows around users of its Android operating system everywhere they go. What the report helps to illustrate, though, is that excessive tracking reflects increasing desperation, as the future for its fundamental business looks increasingly bleak. CB Insights writes, “Though last quarter’s results were largely positive, there are secular trends that may cloud the long-term outlook. For one, the share of Google ad revenue coming from its own websites topped 80% for the first in in Q2’16.” The linked evidence further breaks down how the company has come to see nearly zero growth in its network ads, the ones that publishers voluntarily place on their own sites. All its advertising growth is increasingly on sites it owns. It gets worse. “Mobile ads generally are also less lucrative than desktop ads, so Google’s success in mobile has been accompanied by a decline in cost-per-click,” the report explains. “In fact, Google’s share of global digital ad spend continues to decline, as both domestic competitors like Facebook and international rivals like Baidu and Alibaba continue to gain ground.” Further, the internet has more and more begun to take forms in which its not possible to display ads alongside content. “Each query handled through an Alexa- or Siri-driven device threatens the foundation of Google’s current revenue model,” the report writes. “A voice-centric search landscape might still upend the traditional web search-ad display paradigm that it has depended on for over a decade.” There’s an art project called Google Will Eat Itself, where display ads are used to buy shares in Google. It may have been more prescient than the artists behind it realized. Google pushed for more internet access, which led to the internet of everything. Ads can’t be shown on everything, though. It successfully shifted to mobile, but mobile ads earn less money. It built the proof of concept for searching by voice, but Amazon built the product. In technology, one product can only keep a company on the very top for a finite amount of time.  To its credit, Mountain View does not appear to be in denial about this reality. Display ads’ days are numbered, and Google has a lot of uncertain options open that could take the business’ place. Those come in letters.

But it is still seeking improvements from Google. In an interview with TechWeekEurope, Spotify’s vice president of engineering and infrastructure, Nicholas Harteau, explained that “there were only two choices” when it came to cloud platforms that could handle the scale and capabilities that Spotify needed – ruling out Microsoft’s Azure. Read More: Spotify moves to Google Cloud Spotify Google Cloud The firm had first-hand experience of using AWS, as it ran – and continues to run – some of its test and development environments in AWS. “We had a good feel for AWS from the start and understood its capabilities, so when we were exploring the option of cloud we looked at AWS but not as deeply as we did with Google,” he said. Harteau suggested that selecting Google over Amazon wasn’t merely because Google could do things that Amazon could not – he said that both platforms had their strengths and weaknesses. “Amazon has a very broad product, a much longer history and has some things figured out for enabling large businesses which Google hadn’t solved when we had initially adopted it,” he said. However, Harteau emphasised that Spotify decided to pick Google because its platform better aligned with the company’s own strategy. “It just so happens that the strengths that Google has are [more] important for Spotify… Google’s data platform is actually a few steps ahead of Amazon’s, and part of our bet [to go with GCP] is that I expect it to stay a few steps ahead,” he said. What type of cloud strategy does your organisation have? Public Private Hybrid View Results  Loading ... Competitive platform Other areas where he believes Google has advantages over the competition include raw instance performance and simplicity – but he said those weren’t as critical to Spotify as the strength of the data platform. Another comparison Harteau made was on the simplicity of billing on GCP compared to AWS – something Google was keen to emphasise during its GCP Next conference in London. “With GCP it is very easy to work out how much something will cost… you don’t have to do complex maths work to work something out,” he explained However, he called for Google to make changes to its backend side of its billing system: “It feels pretty immature to me – I think that part of it needs some work.” AWS also has the lead when it came to catering for larger organisations, said Harteau. “There are some things in the Google platform that are not built with large organisations in mind. We have small teams that are working on different pieces of the product, so there isn’t just one Spotify development team working on GCP, there are 40,” he added. “And managing things like access rights and accounts and connectivity between those teams, that’s something we still struggle a bit with,” he added. When TechWeekEurope asked Google’s VP of cloud platforms, Brian Stevens, about these issues, he said that he believed Google had solved these issues already. “It wasn’t until recently, we could privately interconnect projects – they were all independent. So if you data or app was in one project and you had to talk to another app, you had to go through a public IP address, and now we have private interconnect between the projects,” he said.

On Monday, Eyefluence, a three-year-old startup that develops eye-interaction software for virtual reality and augmented reality applications, said it is joining Google. "With our forces combined, we will continue to advance eye-interaction technology to expand human potential and empathy on an even larger scale," Eyefluence said in a blog post. "We look forward to the life-changing innovations we'll create together!" A Google spokesperson confirmed the deal to The Register but declined to elaborate on its plans for the company. No price was disclosed. Google has had an interest in eye tracking for years, because the technology offers a window into what people are thinking. "To help us get some insight into this split-second decision-making process, we use eye-tracking equipment in our usability labs," explained Anne Aula and Kerry Rodden, Google user experience researchers, in a 2009 blog post. "This lets us see how our study participants scan the search results page, and is the next best thing to actually being able to read their minds." In April, Eyefluence framed its own technology in similarly mystical terms. "Eyefluence eye-interaction really does work so fast it seems to know what you want as it comes into your mind," Robert Rohm, Eyefluence testing technician, said in a blog post. Mind-reading may seem redundant for Google, given what it already knows about people through search histories, website visits, ad impressions, and Gmail messages. But that information, helpful though it may be for targeting ads, can't help anticipate what someone wearing a Google VR headset wants to do through a visual interface. That's where Eyefluence comes in. Eye tracking for usability concerns the past – what was done – so that designers and engineers can improve the way people interact with their software. Eyefluence's technology has the potential to reveal the future – what people intend to do. It informs the interface layer rather than backend analytics. Rohm said that in the past, eye-tracking as a means of registering application input has been problematic because blink activation – using blinks to trigger events – and dwell time – staring at an onscreen item to trigger some action – proved too aggravating or tiring. Eyefluence's technology, he said, has solved those issues. Given Google's ardent interest in VR and AR – exemplified by its Daydream platform, Cardboard, Expeditions, Jump, and investments in firms like Magic Leap – some measure of mind-reading could prove useful. And if VR content ever becomes popular enough to warrant the integration of sponsored content, Google can probably figure out ways to make eye-tracking useful for its advertising business. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register Google's new VR Daydream View will cripple your phone Mmmm, soft, tactile, sensuous fabric… wait, why is your head on fire? 19 Comments Intel throws the ball long with sports, VR and IoT cash injections Chip giant puts $38m into next generation of digital tech Forget high-powered PCs, mobile is the future of VR, says Google Google I/O 2016 But you'll need a new phone to do it 14 Comments Race for wireless VR headset heats up Now Vive joins Oculus and Sulon in effort to escape PC connection 46 Comments Why does the VR industry think 2016 is its year?

By Conner Forrest | October 25, 2016, 11:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Google The newest addition to Google's G Suite isn't a productivity app; rather, it's a massive piece of hardware. On Tuesday, Google unveiled Jamboard, a large digital whiteboard built to encourage collaboration among team members in an organization. Essentially, Jamboard looks like a large TV, set on a stand or on the wall, with a bright colored backing. It comes with a stylus and digital eraser, so team members can quickly jot down, or get rid of, ideas. If users want, they can also erase any scribbles with their finger, too. Jamboard has a 55-inch 4k display, and promises "best-in-class touch response time," according to Google's web page announcing the product. It also has built-in speakers, an HD camera, and Wi-Fi connectivity. SEE: Cloud computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) Jamboard is positioned as the next component of Google's G Suite. It offers integration with other apps in the suite like Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drive, so users can bring work in from those apps as part of their brainstorming. Google's announcement also noted that users can pull images and other content from the web to Jamboard.

Whiteboard sessions created with Jamboard are saved in the cloud, so users can go back and work on their Jamboard after a meeting concludes, according to Google. According to a report from Fortune, whiteboard sessions can be saved as a JAM file to Google Drive, and Jamboard will work with Android and iOS devices. Being that Jamboard is cloud-based, it also allows for remote collaboration. In a YouTube video demonstrating the product, an employee appears to be calling in to the meeting, with her video call appearing right on the screen. The Jamboard is powered by Android, and Google's announcement page said that there is a smartphone and tablet companion app available. Google's announcement page said that Jamboard will be available sometime in 2017, and BenQ will help with the initial sales and reseller distribution. The final product will cost roughly $6,000. Interested parties can sign up for more information here. Jamboard is just the latest evidence that Google is trying to get back into the hardware game in a major way. After rumors that Google would step away from handset manufacturing and shutter the Nexus brand, Google launched the AI-powered Pixel phone. Jamboard, however, is Google's first foray into enterprise hardware in quite some time. The biggest competitor will likely be the Microsoft Surface Hub, which is more expensive. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google unveiled its digital whiteboard Jamboard, a 55-inch digital touch screen for collaboration in the conference room. Jamboard integrates with G Suite apps, so users can pull in work from Docs or Drive, or grab images from the web for their whiteboard session. Jamboard will be available in 2017, and will cost around $6,000. Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Tech News You Can Use newsletter.

On Oct. 25, Google announced it is extending its online shopping and delivery service across the Southeast and Northwest. With the increase, Google Express will reach 70 million more people, according to the company. The growth is part of a push to make Google Express available nationwide by the end of the year. The service, launched in select cities in 2013, announced expansions to 16 states earlier this year and 13 more in the Northeast last month before making the Oct. 25 announcement. The company said that Google Express delivery service’s coverage area now will include Florida, Kentucky, Utah, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Last month, it expanded across wide swaths of the Northeast and New England, Google Express General Manager Brian Elliott said. Google Express' goal is to makes it easy to shop in one convenient place, Elliott said. Shoppers can use Google Express to order goods online from a variety of stores using the Google Express desktop site or via smartphone app and receive two-day delivery; select retailers will offer one-day service, Elliott said. The service will compete with Amazon’s Prime Now. The major difference is the number of participating retailers. For example, Google's Florida partners include Costco, Whole Foods, Kohl’s, PetSmart, Road Runner Sports, Sur La Table, Fry’s, Walgreens, L’Occitane, Payless ShoeSource and Guitar Center. More retailers will be continually added to the service, Elliott said. The move comes at a time when increasing numbers of shoppers are turning to Amazon first. According to a survey last month, 55% of U.S. online consumers begin their product searches on Amazon’s website or mobile app, up from 44%t last year. Google saw a decline of people starting searches on its search engine, according to the annual survey by internet marketing firm BloomReach. 1 2 Next >> By Nancy Dahlberg Miami Herald   Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

But every time a new device is released, there are some features that aren’t spoken about or revealed right away. This is why Phandroid provides users its “Tips & Tricks” whenever a new flagship device is released, so that we can share the fruits of our labor while checking out the latest devices. Google has made things a bit easier this time around, as they have a new landing page for various tips and tricks to “make the most of your Pixel”. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen Google do something similar, but the previous iteration was geared more towards Android as a whole, versus a specific device (or two).  Currently, there are 6 different categories which you can filter through to learn more about. After filtering out what you don’t care about, you then are presented with different options on the right-side of the page. Clicking each individual box then explains how to implement those tips and guide you through the process. Categories:  Google Assistant Camera Google Photos Google Duo Google Play Music Made by Google   Feel free to head over to the landing page by clicking the link below, and be sure to check out Phandroid’s full list of tips & tricks for Pixel and Pixel XL owners.

They have no storage restrictions, your can upload images as well as videos, and visual search helps you find photos by people or things in them. There’s one feature though that’s still missing in Google Photos. You can easily share your photos with anyone using a simple link but Google Photos offers no option for you to embed an existing image into a website. That is, if you have already uploaded an image onto Google Photos, you can’t directly embed it into your website through Google Photos. I wrote an app to help you embed #GooglePhotos in your website https://t.co/cDt4NorvWi pic.twitter.com/mq7J4h4qzj— Amit Agarwal (@labnol) October 25, 2016 Google Photos as an Image Host Embed Google Photos is a new web app that, as the name suggests, makes it extremely easy for you to pick any image hosted on Google Photos and place it on a web page using simple HTML code. Here’re the steps involved: Go to photos.google.com and open any image that you wish to embed in your website. Tap the Share Icon (video tutorial) and then choose Get Link to generate a shareable link for that image. Go to j.mp/EmbedGooglePhotos, paste that link and it will instantly generate the embed code for that picture. Open your website template, paste the generated code and save (see sample). The image will now serve directly from your Google Photos account. This technique can also be used for embedding images in HTML Mail without having to use an external image hosting service. Embed Google Photos – How it works? When you share a single photo via a link inside Google Photos, it creates an unlisted link that is accessible to anyone including those who are not logged into their Google Accounts. Internally, the app downloads the page behind this link and extracts the Open Graph tags to determine the direct link of the image and the underlying photo album. Also see: Google Photos – The Good Parts The embed app only works for single images and not albums. One more thing. I am not aware of any bandwidth limitations for images shared via Google Photos.

(Google via AP) This image provided by Google shows a demonstration of the company's new product called "Jamboard." Google has designed the giant touch-screen canvas for companies trying to make it easier for their employees to brainstorm as they work on team projects and other assignments. Google is releasing the device to a small group of companies Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, before making it widely available in early 2017. (Google via AP) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) San Francisco • Google has designed a giant touch-screen canvas for companies trying to make it easier for their employees to brainstorm as they work on team projects and other assignments. The product is called "Jamboard," an allusion to its goal of replacing the physical whiteboards that companies have been setting up in meeting rooms for decades. It boasts a 55-inch, ultrahigh-definition screen capable of recognizing the difference between when someone is writing on it with a stylus or touching it with a finger. Google is releasing the device to a small group of companies Tuesday before making it widely available early next year. VIDEOS TOP JOBS As with a whiteboard, employees can post their ideas, documents and images on the Jamboard, only they won't need markers, tape or sticky notes to do it. Instead, they can use their fingers, a stylus or smartphones and smaller tablets to share information and content from anywhere with an online connection. All the work posted on a Jamboard can be saved in Google's online storage service, Drive. Jamboard represents Google's latest effort to lure business and government customers away from Microsoft, which makes a similar product called the Surface Hub. Google is undercutting Microsoft by pricing Jamboard at about $6,000, a 33 percent markdown from the $9,000 Surface Hub. Using Jamboard will require a subscription to Google's G Suite of email and other business applications, a service that starts at $5 per month. Jamboard reinforces Google's push to make its own gear in an attempt to hook more people on its software and other digital services. Until this fall, Google had teamed up with other manufacturers whenever it made a phone or other gadget. But Google just rolled out a fancy smartphone called the Pixel that it designed itself. Soon it will start selling an internet-connected speaker called Home. Both those devices feature a digital assistant powered by Google's artificial-intelligence programs. Jamboard operates with an application that works on smartphones and tablets powered either by Google's Android software or Apple's operating system for iPhones and Pads. Jamboard won't work with Microsoft's Windows system, making it incompatible with Surface tablets and most personal computers.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Democrat Elijah Cummings presses Jason Chaffetz to investigate Donald Trump's finances Utah football: Oregon is struggling, but Utes still see a dangerous team (with video) Jazz update: Hood, Hill, Favors, Diaw questionable vs. Memphis ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

 Why Tim Cook is Steve Ballmer and why he still has his job at Apple Steve Blank Oct. 25, 2016, 2:48 PM 22,438 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP and Justin Sullivan/Getty Images; composite by Business Insider What happens to a company when a visionary CEO is gone? Most often innovation dies and the company coasts for years on momentum and its brand.  Rarely does it regain its former glory. Here’s why. Microsoft entered the 21st century as the dominant software provider for anyone who interacted with a computing device. 16 years later it’s just another software company. After running Microsoft for 25 years, Bill Gates handed the reins of CEO to Steve Ballmer in January 2000. Ballmer went on to run Microsoft for the next 14 years. If you think the job of a CEO is to increase sales, then Ballmer did a spectacular job. He tripled Microsoft’s sales to $78 billion and profits more than doubled from $9 billion to $22 billion. The launch of the Xbox and Kinect, and the acquisitions of Skype and Yammer happened on his shift. If the Microsoft board was managing for quarter to quarter or even year to year revenue growth, Ballmer was as good as it gets as a CEO. But if the purpose of the company is long-term survival, then one could make a much better argument that he was a failure as a CEO as he optimized short-term gains by squandering long-term opportunities. How to Miss the Boat – Five Times Despite Microsoft’s remarkable financial performance, as Microsoft CEO Ballmer failed to understand and execute on the five most important technology trends of the 21stcentury: in search – losing to Google; in smartphones – losing to Apple; in mobile operating systems – losing to Google/Apple; in media – losing to Apple/Netflix; and in the cloud – losing to Amazon. Microsoft left the 20th century owning over 95% of the operating systems that ran on computers (almost all on desktops). Fifteen years and 2 billion smartphones shipped in the 21st century and Microsoft’s mobile OS share is 1%. These misses weren’t in some tangential markets – missing search, mobile and the cloud were directly where Microsoft users were heading.  Yet a very smart CEO missed all of these.  Why? Execution and Organization of Core Businesses It wasn’t that Microsoft didn’t have smart engineers working on search, media, mobile and cloud. They had lots of these projects. The problem was that Ballmer organized the company around execution of its current strengths – Windows and Office businesses. Projects not directly related to those activities never got serious management attention and/or resources. For Microsoft to have tackled the areas they missed – cloud, music, mobile, apps – would have required an organizational transformation to a services company. Services (Cloud, ads, music) have a very different business model. They are hard to do in a company that excels at products. Ballmer and Microsoft failed because the CEO was a world-class executor (a Harvard grad and world-class salesman) of an existing business model trying to manage in a world of increasing change and disruption. Microsoft executed its 20th-century business model extremely well, but it missed the new and more important ones. The result?  Great short-term gains but long-term prospects for Microsoft are far less compelling. In 2014, Microsoft finally announced that Ballmer would retire, and in early 2014, Satya Nadella took charge. Nadella got Microsoft organized around mobile and the cloud (Azure), freed the Office and Azure teams from Windows, killed the phone business and got a major release of Windows out without the usual trauma. And is moving the company into augmented reality and conversational AI. While they’ll likely never regain the market dominance they had in the 20th century, (their business model continues to be extremely profitable) Nadella likely saved Microsoft from irrelevance. What’s Missing? Visionary CEOs are not “just” great at assuring world-class execution of a tested and successful business model, they are also world-class innovators. Visionary CEOs are product and business model centric and extremely customer focused. The best are agile and know how to pivot – make a substantive change to the business model while or before their market has shifted. The very best of them shape markets – they know how to create new markets by seeing opportunities before anyone else. They remain entrepreneurs.  Steve Blank One of the best examples of a visionary CEO is Steve Jobs who transformed Apple from a niche computer company into the most profitable company in the world. Between 2001 to 2008, Jobs reinvented the company three times. Each transformation – from a new computer distribution channel – Apple Stores to disrupting the music business with iPod and iTunes in 2001; to the iPhone in 2007; and the App store in 2008 – drove revenues and profits to new heights. Steve Blank These were not just product transitions, but radical business model transitions – new channels, new customers and new markets–and new emphasis on different parts of the organization (design became more important than the hardware itself and new executives became more important than the current ones). Visionary CEOs don’t need someone else to demo the company’s key products for them. They deeply understand products, and they have their own coherent and consistent vision of where the industry/business models and customers are today, and where they need to take the company.  They know who their customers are because they spend time talking to them. They use strategy committees and the exec staff for advice, but none of these CEOs pivot by committee. Why Tim Cook Is the New Steve Ballmer And that brings us to Apple, Tim Cook and the Apple board. One of the strengths of successful visionary and charismatic CEOs is that they build an executive staff of world-class operating executives (and they unconsciously force out any world-class innovators from their direct reports). The problem is in a company driven by a visionary CEO, there is only one visionary. This type of CEO surrounds himself with extremely competent executors, but not disruptive innovators. While Steve Jobs ran Apple, he drove the vision but put strong operating execs in each domain – hardware, software, product design, supply chain, manufacturing – who translated his vision and impatience into plans, process and procedures. Steve Blank When visionary founders depart (death, firing, etc.), the operating executives who reported to them believe it’s their turn to run the company (often with the blessing of the ex CEO).  At Microsoft, Bill Gates anointed Steve Ballmer, and at Apple Steve Jobs made it clear that Tim Cook was to be his successor. Once in charge, one of the first things these operations/execution CEOs do is to get rid of the chaos and turbulence in the organization. Execution CEOs value stability, process and repeatable execution. On one hand that’s great for predictability, but it often starts a creative death spiral – creative people start to leave, and other executors (without the innovation talent of the old leader) are put into more senior roles – hiring more process people, which in turn forces out the remaining creative talent. This culture shift ripples down from the top and what once felt like a company on a mission to change the world now feels like another job. As process oriented as the new CEOs are, you get the sense that one of the things they don’t love and aren’t driving are the products (go look at the Apple Watch announcements and see who demos the product). Tim Cook has now run Apple for five years, long enough for this to be his company rather than Steve Jobs’. The parallel between Gates and Ballmer and Jobs and Cook is eerie. Apple under Cook has doubled its revenues to $200 billion while doubling profit and tripling the amount of cash it has in the bank (now a quarter of trillion dollars). The iPhone continues its annual upgrades of incremental improvements. Yet in five years the only new thing that managed to get out the door is the Apple Watch. With 115,000 employees Apple can barely get annual updates out for their laptops and desktop computers. But the world is about to disrupt Apple in the same way that Microsoft under Ballmer faced disruption. Apple brilliantly mastered User Interface and product design to power the iPhone to dominance. But Google and Amazon are betting that the next of wave of computing products will be AI-directed services – machine intelligence driving apps and hardware. Think of Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Assistant directed by voice recognition that’s powered by smart, conversational Artificial Intelligence – and most of these will be a new class of devices scattered around your house, not just on your phone. It’s possible that betting on the phone as the platform for conversational AI may not be the winning hand. It’s not that Apple doesn’t have exciting things in conversational AI going on in their labs. Heck, Siri was actually first. Apple also has autonomous car projects, AI-based speakers, augmented and virtual reality, etc in their labs. The problem is that a supply chain CEO who lacks a passion for products and has yet to articulate a personal vision of where to Apple will go is ill equipped to make the right organizational, business model and product bets to bring those to market. Four Challenges for the Board of Directors The dilemma facing the boards at Microsoft, Apple or any board of directors on the departure of an innovative CEO is strategic: Do we still want to be a innovative, risk taking company?  Or should we now focus on execution of our core business, reduce our risky bets and maximize shareholder return. Tactically, that question results in asking: Do you search for another innovator from outside, promote one of the executors or go deeper down the organization to find an innovator? Herein lies four challenges. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates (and 20th century’s other creative icon -Walt Disney) shared the same blind spot: They suggested execution executives as their successors. They confused world-class execution with the passion for product and customers, and market insight. From the perspective of Gates there was no difference between him and Ballmer and from Jobs to Cook. Yet history has shown us for long-term survival in markets that change rapidly that’s definitely not the case. The second conundrum is that if the board decides that the company needs another innovator at the helm, you can almost guarantee that the best executor – the number 2 and/or 3 vice president in the company – will leave, feeling that they deserved the job. Now the board is faced with not only having lost its CEO, but potentially the best of the executive staff. The third challenge is that many innovative/visionary CEOs have become part of the company’s brand. Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Immelt, Elon Musk, Mark Benioff, Larry Ellison. This isn’t a new phenomenon, think of 20th-century icons like Walt Disney, Edward Land at Polaroid, Henry Ford, Lee Iacocca at Chrysler, Jack Welch at GE and Alfred Sloan at GM. But they’re not only an external face to the company, they were often the touchstone for internal decision-making. Years after a visionary CEO is gone companies are still asking “What would Walt Disney/Steve Jobs/Henry Ford have done?” rather than figuring out what they should now be doing in the changing market. Finally, the fourth conundrum is that as companies grow larger and management falls prey to the fallacy that it only exists to maximize shareholder short-term return on investment, companies become risk averse. Large companies and their boards live in fear of losing what they spent years gaining (customers, market share, revenue, profits.) This may work in stable markets and technologies. But today very few of those remain. In the 21st Century an Execution CEO as a Successor Increasingly May be The Wrong Choice In a startup the board of directors realizes that risk is the nature of new ventures and innovation is why they exist. On day one there are no customers to lose, no revenue and profits to decline. Instead there is everything to gain. In contrast, large companies are often risk-averse engines – they are executing a repeatable and scalable business model that spins out the short-term dividends, revenue and profits that the stock market rewards. And an increasing share price becomes the reason for existing.  The irony is that in the 21st century, the tighter you hold on to your current product/markets, the likelier you will be disrupted. (As articulated in the classic Clayton Christensen book The Innovators Dilemma, in industries with rapid technology or market shifts, disruption cannot be ignored.) Increasingly, a hands-on product/customer, and business model-centric CEO with an entrepreneurial vision of the future may be the difference between market dominance and Chapter 11. In these industries, disruption will create opportunities that force “bet the company” decisions about product direction, markets, pricing, supply chain, operations and the reorganization necessary to execute a new business model.  At the end of the day CEOs who survive embrace innovation, communicate a new vision and build management to execute the vision. Lessons Learned Innovation CEOs are almost always replaced by one of their execution VPs If they have inherited a powerful business model this often results in gains in revenue and profits that can continue for years However, as soon the market, business model, technology shifts, these execution CEOs are ill-equipped to deal with the change – the result is a company obsoleted by more agile innovators and left to live off momentum in its twilight years.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Google Jamboard Hands-On: Collaboration, Evolved By Hubert Nguyen on 10/25/2016 11:35 PST Google Just announced the Jamboard, a 4K, 55” Android-powered interactive display that is designed and optimized for collaboration. Although it looks like an electronic white board on the surface, it is so much more than that. Jamboard is a collaboration tool and a new file format that encapsulate things we do when collaborating on a whiteboard format. The metric of success: you will never take a whiteboard photo again and your productivity should increase. We had some play time with it. First impressions. A new whiteboard format in the cloud Part of the Google G Suite, the Google Jamboard is a connected screen that integrates with the existing Google tools such as Google Drive (and Docs), Google’s Communication tools and of course, Google Accounts. An individual can create a new project, and either invite others to it or let them join as they find the Jamboard and send a request. The owner of the project can accept/reject requests and edit permissions from the board in a similar fashion to Google Docs. Once in, several people can draw, write, add images, sticky notes, Google Docs, and more to the document. For now, it is possible to create the equivalent of 20 whiteboard screens; a virtual surface area deemed enough, but it’s not a hard limit. Google could change that in the future if needed. Everything is saved to the cloud in real-time. For now, Docs, Pages and other potentially “living” elements that are susceptible to change later are added as “snapshots”, and won’t auto-update or be updated in the session. Technically, it could be possible to make them self-update (Google looked at it) but most of the time, the user intent is to capture a snapshot. Also, the Jamboard is not the ideal medium to update documents, but Google says that if there’s a demand, it will consider it. Designed to be intuitive After an introduction to Jamboard, we were left to try things with the board, and its usage is extremely easy and natural. As you can see on the design, it looks like a regular whiteboard, including the tray to put the markers and erasers. It was intentionally build to feel familiar, but there are details that show the care the product team had when designing: The markers, erasers, and tray, are magnetized, so they never fall to the ground. The markers even have a flat site, to further prevent rolling motion. The screen’s touch display can tell the difference between markers and fingers. You can erase with your fingers if you want, but the eraser is there to make Jamboard feel more natural. The user interface is very intuitive. I could create a Jam session, draw, cut, move and add information without any trouble. The electronic ink is fast, which is a critical element for any whiteboard application, and there’s even a shape and text recognition function if you want to enable text-search or have a cleaner look for your document. Built-in communications and collaboration The Google Jamboard has a built-in camera and can act as a Google Hangout video-call box. Google demonstrated using the Jamboard for video conversations, or as part of a larger Google multiscreen video-conferencing room. The multi-screen experience is best to maximize the whiteboard surface, but dedicating a small portion of the surface to see your colleagues worked well too. Contribute with Phones and Tablets Jamboard is about collaboration, and one would expect participants from different offices to have one in each location. However, remote workers can also contribute using tablets and phones. There are two distinct use cases here. Tablets have the full functionality of the Jamboard. Anything that the Jamboard can do, an iOS or Android tablet will support as well (if hardware allows). Yes. It means that tablets owners in SMBs can use this new format without buying the full-size device (which remains the optimal solution for enterprises). This could also open the door to 3rd party solutions based on Android-powered TVs, but it’s too early to tell. Phones can be used to contribute, but won’t feature the full functionality. This makes sense because the whiteboard experience on a small screen is predictably poor. However, you can upload photos and add media to a Jam session from your phone. Joining via Hangout should work too. Take your session with you Because the whole session is recorded to the cloud, you no longer need to scramble to take photos at the end of the meeting. Also, if you get the typical “hey, we booked the room” from another team, it’s easy just to log off, and restart at a different location. Of course, you can continue working on the session from a tablet, and sessions can be viewed from the web, or exported as (static) PDF files, which is hugely useful as a means to quickly send snapshots. Conclusion and Pricing The overall user experience was stellar. Google Jamboard is the most advanced “white-board style” collaboration tool I’ve seen to date. At the moment, Google has kept things as simple as possible, using both internal teams and select Google G Suite customers (like Netflix) as early users. Jamboard is targeted at enterprises, and with a priced of $6000, it is an aggressive entry into this market, for a good product that has little competition in the real world. Over time, and if 3rd party hardware vendors jump in, you could see prices drop further. BenQ is Google’s hardware partner for this project. Availability, and OS support Google will continue to refine the final design of the Jamboard, which should be available “in 2017” (we guess by summer 2017). With today’s announcement, Google also opens the Early Adopter Program (EAP), so if your company is interested, contact the Jamboard Team. Filed in Computers.

However, the more interesting collaboration software that runs on the 55-inch 4K touchscreen will also be available through companion iOS phone and tablet apps. The Jamboard is integrated with the Google’s various cloud services and allows for Docs, Sheets, and Slides to be easily placed on a board. Annotations, notes, and other drawings are automatically uploaded to Google Drive for later access and editing. With a built-in browser, users can easily add pictures and other content from the web to the board. Besides live collaboration with other Jamboards, smartphone and tablet apps allow teammates to work remotely while seeing and making additions to the board. Specifically, Google tells us that “the tablet app has the same UI as the Jamboard” and that “people can use the companion app from numerous devices (smartphones, tablets) and still jam/collaborate.” Smartphones will be able to view and input data, while the iPad app will have access to all the editing tools available on the Jamboard. The real-time collaboration features are quite reminiscent of Google Wave, but appear to be much friendlier and simpler to use.

But newly released FBI notes strongly suggest they still exist in several locations — and they could be recovered, if only someone would impanel a grand jury and seize them. In a May interview with FBI agents, an executive with the Denver contractor that maintained Clinton’s private server revealed that an underling didn’t bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to Clinton’s aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to Congress. The Platte River Networks executive, whose name was redacted from the interview report, said PRN tech Paul Combetta “created a ‘vehicle’ to transfer email files from the live mailboxes of [Clinton Executive Services Corp.] email accounts [and] then later used BleachBit software to shred the ‘vehicle,’ but the email content still existed in the live email accounts.” Unless one of Clinton’s aides had the capability to log in to the PRN server as an administrator and remove a mailbox, her archived mailboxes more than likely still reside somewhere in that system. And they may also materialize on an internal “shared drive” that PRN created to control access to the Clinton email accounts among PRN employees. PRN has been under FBI order to preserve all emails and other evidence since the start of its investigation last year. Clinton’s missing “personal” emails may also be captured on a Google server. According to FBI notes, Combetta “transferred all of the Clinton email content to a personal Google email address he created.” Only the FBI never subpoenaed Google to find out. The FBI documents also reveal that Hillary’s server was mirrored on a cloud server in Pennsylvania maintained by Datto Inc., a tech firm that performs cloud-to-cloud data protection. When PRN contracted with Datto, it requested that Hillary’s server be backed up locally and privately. But the techs forgot to order the private node, and they sent the server backup data “remotely to Datto’s secure cloud and not to a local private node.” The FBI never subpoenaed Datto’s server, either. Then there’s the laptop Combetta loaded with the Clinton email archive and allegedly shipped back to a Clinton aide in Washington, who claims it got “lost” in the mail. Not so fast: The latest FBI document dump includes a series of interviews with an unidentified former “special assistant” to Clinton at the State Department who said the elusive Apple MacBook laptop was actually “shipped to the Clinton Foundation in New York City.” But in a June follow-up interview, FBI agents inexplicably left it up to this critical witness to “inquire about the shipment” with the foundation’s mailroom manager, who works in Rockefeller Center. The FBI still does not have the laptop in its possession. It turns out that investigators also know the whereabouts of the original Apple server Clinton used in her first two months in office. Recovering that equipment is critical because it contains a mass of unseen emails from Jan. 21, 2009, to March 18, 2009 — a critical period in Clinton’s tenure at State. Witnesses say the equipment was not discarded, as first believed, but “repurposed” as a “work station” used by staff in Clinton’s Chappaqua residence. Yet the FBI says it “was unable to obtain the original Apple server for a forensic review.” Instead of seizing it, the agency has taken Clinton’s aides’ and lawyers’ word that the server’s bereft of relevant emails. In fact, the agency confesses on Page 27 of its 47-page investigative case summary that it failed to recover other equipment and data as well: “The FBI’s inability to recover all server equipment and the lack of complete server log data for the relevant time period limited the FBI’s forensic analysis of the server systems. As a result, FBI cyber analysis relied, in large part, on witness statements.” Congressional investigators say FBI Director James Comey in his year-long “investigation” didn’t even bother to send agents to search Clinton’s homes in Chappaqua or Washington, DC. Nor did he dispatch them to the offices of the Clinton Foundation or Clinton Executive Services Corp. in New York City. “The Clinton residences and other locations should have been treated like any other criminal investigation — with federal grand jury subpoenas or search warrants issued by judges and served in the middle of the night,” said veteran FBI special agent Michael M. Biasello, who worked criminal cases out of New York and other field offices for 27 years. “Never — I repeat, never — in my career have I or any FBI agent known to me investigated a criminal case without the use of a federal grand jury, grand jury subpoenas or search warrants,” he said. “It’s disgraceful they weren’t used in this case.” The most damning evidence against Clinton may never have been actually destroyed. It was simply left untouched by the FBI.

The Jamboard is a digital whiteboard aimed at team collaboration with a 55-inch 4K display and integration with all of Google’s cloud offerings. The Jamboard comes in multiple colors and is designed to be movable with an integrated stand, wheels, and single-cable setup. A built-in HD camera, speakers, and Wi-Fi allows for video conferencing and broadcasting through Hangouts. It can also be mounted on a wall and features pen and eraser holders underneath. Neither tools require batteries or pairing, with the display automatically recognizing between the two. Additionally, like a real whiteboard, fingers can also be used to wipe away work off the screen. Virtual tools include sticky notes and other drawing utensils, while the Android-powered Jamboard supports handwriting and shape recognition. Docs, Sheets, Slides and photos can be easily added to the whiteboard. Each drawing is referred to as a ‘jam’ and gets automatically saved to Google Drive for later access and editing. In addition to live collaboration with other Jamboards, smartphone and tablet apps allow teammates to work remotely while seeing and making additions to the board. The former device only allows for viewing and inputting data, while the tablet apps feature all of the editing tools available to Jamboard devices. Google confirmed apps will be available for iOS,  Android and Chrome OS. The Jamboard will be available for under $6000 next year. Google notes that the device is “competitively priced,” as “touch displays have traditionally been expensive.” G Suite customers will be able to join an Early Adopter Program in order to perfect the device before a wider release.   Guides G Suite View THe Guide Google Jamboard View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Google Express Bringing Delivery Service To 13 More States Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Express Bringing Delivery Service To 13 More States October 25, 2016 2:31 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk fetch that for me will you? Google Express delivery services delivery google same-day delivery Google is continuing its quest to take on same-day delivery services around the country: Google Express is now rolling out in 14 additional cities, including in Amazon’s home state of Washington. After expanding into much of the northeast last month, Google’s home delivery service will now be available in parts of Alabama, Kentucky, Utah, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington, TechCrunch reports. The addition of those areas will mean Google Express now reaches 70 million more people, according to the company, covering about 90% of the United States. “Our goal with Google Express is to offer a great shopping experience and connect people with their favorite stores,” Brian Elliott, general manager of Google Express, said in a news release. Google Express has some restrictions on what it will deliver from a list of partner stores: it tested a pilot program for fresh and frozen groceries in San Francisco and Los Angeles in 2015, but Elliott says the idea wasn’t scalable, USAToday notes. “We really wanted something where we can make sure we have a nationally scalable product that can reach everybody,” Elliott said. On that note, “We’re not doing refrigerated or frozen goods,” he told The News & Observer. “And we’re not going to deliver a couch.” Customers can either pay for a $10 monthly membership and receive free delivery when the order meets the per-store minimum ($15 in most cases, but some require an order of at least $35), or pay each time you shop starting at $4.99 per store. New members can try the service for three months free. October 25, 2016 By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk fetch that for me will you?

Users will be able to draw, write and erase items on the 55-inch Jamboard, while contributors and collaborators will be able to chip in from remote locations. Google is enabling these ‘Jams’ to be broadcast by the host via Google Hangouts calls, for those unable to be present in the office conference room. Also, owners of iOS or Android tablets will benefit from a rich array of touchscreen editing tools that enable them to collaborate in real time. The companion smartphone apps will allow users to follow along, but not to edit. Naturally, the whiteboard will sync everything back to the collaborators’ Google Drive folders, the company revealed via a blog post on Tuesday. The display comes with a pair of thick styluses and an eraser, while fingers can also be used in the latter capacity. It can recognize 16-points of contact at a time, meaning colleagues gathered around the Jamboard won’t have to wait their turn to contribute. It won’t be cheap though. It’ll sit just below $6,000 when it hoes on sale to G Suite customers before next summer. Google Pixel Phone Overpriced?

The article is called 5 reasons why the smartwatch market took a dramatic nosedive and is located at http://www.starkinsider.com/2016/10/5-reasons-smartwatch-market-nosedived-quickly.html. Captcha Submit CLOSE Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Culture Tech/SV Wanderlust Interviews Video Features Tech & Silicon Valley 5 reasons why the smartwatch market took a dramatic nosedive It was the next big thing. Until it became a boring party trick. By Clinton Stark - 10.25.2016 When sales fall over 50% year over year for just about any business in any industry, people begin to worry. Panic ensues. Heads roll. And substantial, desperate measures are put in place — though far often too late. Proof point: the San Francisco 49ers. Or, as we’re discussing today, the smartwatch market. Analyst firm International Data Corporation (IDC) calls the plummet in smartwatch shipments “growing pains” and suggests that vendors are “realigning.” I think that’s a polite way of saying it’s a trainwreck. Aside from Garmin (+324%) and Samsung (+9%) every other company who makes a smartwatch has seen massive hits to shipments: Apple (-71%); Lenovo, under the Motorola brand (-73%); Pebble (-54%); and all the “others” which would also include Huawei (-27%). It’s no wonder then that we’ve seen major price slashes (Apple Watch discounts), bundling promotions (free smartwatch with a phone), and a shift in functionality that emphasize fitness over gimmickry (Pebble Health). So, yes, it would appear the honeymoon phase is over. But, why? Why on earth has this once promising market opportunity come crashing down so fast, so hard? (Google Glass anyone?) Here’s five theories. 5 Reasons Why the Smartwatch Market Nosedived So Fast, So Hard Theory One: Smartwatches are too Expensive Remember that $17,000 Apple Watch? Apple believed that smartwatches could be fashionable. It priced them accordingly. Sure, you can today buy a Series 2 with a sport band for $269 (38mm case), but that’s still too much. Consumers revolted. These are accessories. They are complimentary, not in of themselves entirely useful — you pair them with a phone and enjoy notifications and bits of information at the glance of your wrist. Nothing more, nothing less. I’ve long argued that the right price is around $99 (USD). Smartwatches are accessories. But that doesn’t make for tantalizing headlines or tweets. Those who love classic timepieces will turn to traditionalist makers like Tag Heuer, Rolex, and Baume & Mercier. And pay accordingly for the fashion statement and possible collect-ability. Others, like me, who find smartwatches useful (but not essential) will gladly pay about $99 to have a useful accessory. Theory Two: Smartphones Get the Job Done Already Our iPhones and Androids already do just about everything (save for heart rate monitoring) smartwatches do. There’s a lot of overlap. Notifications, of course, come through on our phones already. Music controls are there. Time. Weather. Maps. Email. Calendar. And on and on. It’s a tough sale for a lot of consumers. They’ve paid, say, $800 for a shiny new iPhone. And now you want them to pay another $300+ for a watch that tells them every hour to stand up? Theory Three: The Smartwatch is Solution in Search of a Problem Closely related to Theory Two is the idea that no one ever asked for a smartwatch. There could even be a conspiracy element here. That deep within the dungeons of Apple and Google, a cackling crew of profiteers stared into their magic balls and chanted maniaclly for new market growth. Everything was stalling. The iPhone saturated. Too many tablets. Too much of everything. Aha! The wearable! Perfect! This, they agreed, would be a high-margin upsell. Multiple benefits would acrrue to Apple and Google’s top line, and hence, stock price. Aside from the additional revenue, the watch would bolster vendor lock-in. After all, if you have an iPhone and an Apple Watch, switching to Android (and vice-versa) is that much more trouble. Perhaps Apple and Google wanted all of this more than us. Trend Spotting: IDC Report on Smartwatch Shipments, Q3 2016 Source: IDC (Units in Millions) Theory Four: The Newton Effect Apple and Google don’t need to convince themselves that smartwatches are cool and practical, they need to convince the rest of us. The Apple Newton came out 23 years ago. It bombed. Despite having nifty (though mostly faulty) hand-writing recognition, and a touch interface, it seemed we weren’t ready for such a soshisticated PDA. Yet. In 2010, that all changed with the introduction of something called the iPad. Apple took what it learned from John Sculley’s 1993 pet project, refined it by adding slick apps, an intuitive interface, and decent battery life, and… and, well, the rest is history. Could it be that the smartwatch (and maybe wearables at large) are ahead of their time? This theory suggests that once battery life is improved — vastly improved — so that we need only charge a smartwatch once a month then we might be more accepting. That we won’t simplicity (not the ridiculous, microscopic keyboards found on Android Wear devices) and practicality. And that these watches need to look less like electronic experiments and more like traditional time pieces. Theory Five: Blame Tech Blogs Tech bloggers like shiny, new things. Google Glass. Yes! Virtual Reality. Yes! Smartwatches. Yes! I should know. I own several smartwatches. I’ve been known to pixel peep, I love camera tech, and I am an unapologetic early adopter. Tech blogs caressed smartwatches, hailed them. And called them the next big thing. Still, I don’t suspect anyone would confuse that geeky excitement for rational assessment of a market opportunity. Ask yourself this. When was the last time a tech blogger cared about monitoring their heart rates 7/24? Answer: when smartwatches came out in 2014. Because it was cool. A great party trick. Tech blogs caressed smartwatches, hailed them. And called them the next big thing. What’s Next for the Smartwatch? Maybe none of those theories prove true. Or maybe it’s a combination of factors. Or possibly you have your own ideas as to why the smartwatch market hasn’t caught on with the mainstream consumer. Regardless, the numbers are there and they stink… 3Q 2016: -51.6% decline in smartwatch shipments. iCharts   Google has smartly delayed its next generation Wear OS (2.0) until 2017. Apple quietly released its Series 2 watches with little to no fanfare. Perhaps the only company making waves this year with new models is Pebble, with its Kickstarter-backed Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 watches. Despite the dramatic crash, and limited product introductions, I don’t expect this to be the end of the smartwatch. The Newton begat the iPad. So there’s hope. Next go around, however, Apple and Google should listen more closely to the everyday customer, and less to their technical influencer communities. They don’t need to convince themselves that smartwatches are cool and practical, they need to convince the rest of us. Explore. Create. Live. Follow Stark Insider on Twitter and Facebook.

It’ll go on sale next year to Google apps customers for “under $6,000.” Google’s newest gadget is for your office: Today, the company is announcing Jamboard, a new cloud-connected digital whiteboard that hooks into its “G Suite” of apps for corporate customers. The Jamboard itself is a Google-designed, 55-inch 4K touchscreen display that runs Android and a new app for whiteboarding. It includes a built-in camera and speakers and can recognize up to 16 simultaneous touch inputs. (It can also tell the difference between human fingers and its no-batteries-or-Bluetooth-pairing-necessary stylus and eraser accessories.) You can mount it to a wall or wheel it around on a custom stand. Google will start selling the device next year, starting at “under $6,000.” © Provided by Vox Media, Inc. Google A wall-mounted Jamboard. But like most of Google’s suite of business apps, the real point is the software and its collaborative cloud service. As you might expect, inside a “Jam” session, you can draw, type, import and scribble on images and Google Docs, search the web in a mini-browser, communicate with colleagues via Google Hangout, and keep a digital record of your work in Google Drive. Teams using multiple Jamboards can work together on the same project in real time, as long as there’s internet access. There’s also a full-featured tablet app for iOS and Android (so others can participate without a Jamboard) and a simpler version of the app for smartphones. Companies can test the concept just using these apps, though Google (obviously) thinks the huge touchscreen is a big part of the equation. It has been testing the software and devices with about 30 teams internally and with external partners including Netflix and Spotify. The move comes as Google is trying to play a deeper role as a software-tools provider for organizations — ranging from its popular corporate version of Gmail to newer, cloud-based infrastructure services — and diversify its business from web advertising, which still represents 90 percent of its revenue. © Provided by Vox Media, Inc. Google Meetings on wheels. Google is particularly proud that it designed the hardware and software in tandem. That’s a concept that has historically been more associated with, say, Apple, or even increasingly Microsoft, one of its chief rivals in business services. Microsoft offers touchscreen “Surface Hub” displays, also marketed as tools for teamwork, in 55- and 84-inch models. But Google is increasingly playing this game — see its recent Home speaker device or its high-end Pixel smartphones — and doing an impressive job. The Jamboard is certainly memorable, covered in a luxurious-feeling, matte, soft-touch plastic. (The team had considered fabric as a cover material, to fit in with conference rooms, someone who worked on the device told me. That would have been interesting.) And while it’ll be available in blue or gray options, the company will be pushing a bold, bright red version as its main color. Google unveiled the device at a small press event yesterday in San Francisco, linked via real-time Jamboard session and Google Hangout to a team in the company’s New York office. The software generally seemed to work without any major lag or bugs, though some things drawn remotely showed up as a bit jerky on the receiving end. In a brief hands-on demo, the display itself looked fine, if a bit harsh on the eyes. And from my seat across the conference room, the screen’s glossy front coating reflected a bit more ceiling light than I’d like. Still, it seems like an interesting option for teams that seek to collaborate more visually in meetings — especially those split among multiple offices or with remote teammates.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Lawyers file fake lawsuits to de-index online negative reviews, suit says "The scam is not all that complicated," using court orders to get search results removed. by David Kravets - Oct 25, 2016 6:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 85 Urich Baumgartgen via Getty Images Two California lawyers are being accused of filing "sham lawsuits" in a wide-ranging conspiracy to get Google and other search engines to de-index negative reviews about their clients. As the case (PDF) brought by a group called Consumer Opinion states: The other conspirators engaged attorneys Mark W. Lapham ("Lapham") and Owen T. Mascott (“Mascott”) to file sham lawsuits either by the subjects of the negative reviews or by corporations that had no interest in the allegedly defamatory statements, against a defendant who most certainly was not the party that published the allegedly defamatory statements, and the parties immediately stipulated to a judgment of injunctive relief, so the conspirators could provide the order to Google and other search engines, thus achieving the goal of deindexing all pages containing negative reviews. Consumer Opinion runs pissedconsumer.com, and the group says these lawyers essentially manipulated California's legal system by conducting a "rather brilliant but incredibly unethical" scheme to make negative reviews on the site essentially disappear from search results. The suit asks a federal judge to "discipline them for those misdeeds." The suit notes a complex web of reputation companies and fake or "stooge" defendants working together. According to the lawsuit, it works like this: the attorneys sue the "stooge" authors of negative reviews—allegedly defamatory reviews that are published on the pissedconsumer.com site. But these lawsuit defendants didn't actually write the review, and the suits immediately settle. The judgements are then used to get Yahoo, Google, and Bing to erase negative reviews from search results. The suit alleges that a Florida attorney, the subject of some 59 negative reviews on pissedconsumer.com, was among the beneficiaries of the alleged scheme. The lawsuit points out six similarly worded defamation lawsuits lodged in Contra Costa County, just east of San Francisco. The suits are filed, according to the lawsuit, because pissedconsumer.com won't remove the reviews from its website. "The scam is not all that complicated," Marc Randazza, Consumer Opinion's attorney, wrote in the lawsuit. Mascott did not immediately respond for comment. The answering machine for Lapham was full, so Ars could not leave a message. This isn't the first time we've seen these type of allegedly fake lawsuits try to game search results, according to Paul Alan Levy of Public Citizen and Eugene Volokh of the Volokh Conspiracy. The duo has concluded that there are at least 25 cases nationwide with what they call a "suspicious profile." "Of these 25-odd cases, 15 give the addresses of the defendants—but a private investigator hired by Professor Volokh (Giles Miller of Lynx Insights & Investigations) couldn’t find a single one of the ostensible defendants at the ostensible address," they wrote. Levy and Volokh pointed out that search engines, when presented with a court order, "can't really know if the injunction was issued against the actual author of the supposed defamation—or against a real person at all."

Introduced today, the Jamboard comes equipped a 55-inch touchscreen display that’s capable of 4K output. If that sounds expensive, it’s because it is, with Google saying the Jamboard will be offered for “less than $6,000.” Google’s vision with the Jamboard seems to put it at the center of the company’s G Suite offerings, aiming to make collaboration and brainstorming easier whether your team is all in one room or split up around the world. With an HD front-facing camera and Wi-Fi capabilities, separate groups can collaborate at the same time, with each team’s edits and ideas appearing in the same space. You wouldn’t even necessarily need two Jamboards to pull off such a meeting, as Google will be offering smartphone and tablet companion apps that allow team members to view and contribute when they’re on the go. The Jamboard itself comes with a variety of built-in tools like sticky notes and stencils while also being able to pull from Google Docs, Sheets, Drive, and the internet. Google also promises a stylus and eraser that don’t need batteries or charging, but “just work.” You’re not even bound to using the eraser that comes packed in the Jamboard, as it’ll be able to recognize when you’re using your finger as an erase what you’ve written down, just like a regular whiteboard. The whole thing is set up on a rolling stand and uses only a single cable, allowing you to move from place to place with the Jamboard fairly easily. Then, when you’re done, the work you did is saved to the Cloud, meaning that you’re free to clear the slate to allow another team to use it. Google has been working with certain G Suite partners to develop and test the Jamboard, and it’ll be going into wider availability for other G Suite users sometime in 2017. Google didn’t get more specific about the release date, but did say that interested parties can sign up for alerts over on the Jamboard landing page.

The total bill of materials for the new 5.5″ device with 32GB of flash memory rounds out to $278. Throw in an additional $7.75 in manufacturing costs and it costs Google $285.75 to crank out each Pixel device. The unsubsidized price of the device is $769, which IHS Market says puts the Pixel XL’s manufacturing cost-to-sales-price ratio in the same range as the iPhone 7 Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Andrew Rassweiler, a senior director at IHS Markit, says this is to be expected since the internals of the phones don’t change much regardless of what brand they are. “Total BOM costs for the Google Pixel XL are, not surprisingly, in line with those of other competitors, because the supply base and specs are very similar from phone to phone—whether it’s an iPhone, a Galaxy-series phone or the Google Pixel XL.” The launch price for the Pixel series has been a sticking point for some die-hard Nexus fans who enjoyed Google’s effort to keep Nexus devices toward the low-end of the cost spectrum. local_offer    Apple   Google   iPhone 7 Plus   Pixel   Pixel XL   Samsung   Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (39) stars Further Reading Samsung introduces Samsung Rewards Samsung buys audio and automotive giant Harma The Galaxy C7 is available for pre-order Google Play Music gets smart redesign Project ARA Q&A stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

If you’ve read any of the many reviews, you probably already knew that. Yes, it can take a mean photo — arguably the best — but the occasional white balance hiccup and wonky auto focus, keep the camera from greatness. Halos, and flares, and glare — Oh my! Inconsistent performance was just one of a few things we mentioned in our Pixel camera review last week, along with the appearance of strong lens flare sometimes creeping into a few of our shots. It will appear in the corner or bottom of photos as a sort of halo. At this point I almost feel like I’m beating a dead horse, but because the issue seems to be making the rounds on the internet, I felt it was worth mentioning… again. When does it appear? The glowing halo or lens flare doesn’t appear in every shot. Far from it. We noticed it that it’s only when the light hits the camera lens at jusssst the right angle that the glare rears its ugly head. Even then, sometimes it’s so faint (depending on how strong the light source is), it’s easy to miss. You can’t just aim your phone at something bright and see if it shows up, lighting is key and it’s very specific. I will say that I’ve been able to recreate it in a variety of instances, but only because I have an idea how the light has to hit the lens for it to show up. What’s causing it? Some have guessed that it could have something to do with grease or smudges covering the lens, but as someone who regularly washes their hands and keeps their phone 100% fingerprint free, this is definitely not the case. I have a very strong feeling it could have something to do with the placement of the lens on the 2.5D back glass panel. It’s possible that because it’s not completely isolated (like the LED flash) and sits so high up (right where the glass panel begins to bend), the glass panel is causing the light to refract in an unusual way. Does every device suffer from this little quirk? iPhone 7 (left), Google Pixel (middle), Honor 8 (right) It’s tough to say if this is simply an isolated hardware defect — one that can be remedied simply by exchanging the “faulty” unit out with a new one — or if it’s a design flaw inherent in every Pixel. I strongly believe it’s the latter, based on the Pixel XL unit I received from Google, the regular sized Pixel I’ve been using from Verizon, and the few units I played around with in the store. Basically, I’ve been able to reproduce this issue with every single Pixel I’ve gotten my hands on. I’m also seeing comments that every phone does this. Sure, lens flares happen in every camera, typically when under direct sunlight. On the Pixel, however, it’s not really a “lens flare,” more of glare (likely caused by the back glass cover). In the above examples, you can see how the halo doesn’t show up on the iPhone 7, or even the Honor 8 which features a similar camera design to the Pixel. So why haven’t other reviewers mentioned it? More Halo action pic.twitter.com/xXv4b3QUoV — Danny Winget (@superscientific) October 22, 2016 Good question. It’s possible they may have missed it, but there are plenty of those who have been very vocal about it. Even in early reviews where they failed to mention it, I’ve seen the halo show up in sample photos posted online by The Verge and MKBHD. In fact, the excessive lens flare was even mentioned in DxOMark’s own rating for the Google Pixel camera, a rating Google wears proudly. Why haven’t you seen it? @superscientific Some unexpected lens flare pic.twitter.com/HVukkSaHNF — Michael Kukielka (@DetroitBORG) October 24, 2016 Again, the lighting conditions for the halo to appear are very specific. Even then, sometimes it’s very faint and if you’re not looking for it, there’s a good chance you wont even know it’s there. Other times it can be very prominent, usually depending on a variety of factors like exactly where the light source is positioned, exposure settings on the phone, and so forth. For those that have yet to find themselves in the unique situation where the glare shows up — you’ve just been lucky. Do we have another another #gate on our hands? Probably not. It’s more or less just an odd little quirk and although it can be a bit annoying, we’re not about to lose sleep over it. There’s a good chance you wont see it at all, as we only noticed it popping up in about 3 of 100 photos we initially took with the Pixel. Of course, it’s still something to take in consideration when looking to upgrade your smartphone, which is why we mentioned it in our initial Pixel camera review, but we’ll let you decide whether or not this is a deal breaker. UPDATE Google has confirmed the Pixel camera’s excessive lens flaring issue, which results in a halo/arc showing up in shots. Not only did they say this is something affecting all Pixel units (and that a hardware exchange / RMA wont fix anything), but that they’re hoping a future software update will help identify and erase the halo from appearing in photos. Seeing as this is a hardware issue, whether or not Google’s software tricks will be 100% effective remains to be seen. local_offer    Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (57) stars Further Reading The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again Pixel & Pixel XL feature magnet for flip cases Pixel mod allows for stereo speaker sound [ROOT] Pixel adoption beating Nexus Quite Black 32GB Pixel & Pixel XL back in stock stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Part of the company's "G Suite" collaboration tools, Jamboard claims to be a "reimagining" of the whiteboard for cloud technology and modern offices. Jamboard is essentially a 55-inch touchscreen on wheels. It has a 4K display with what Google says is a "best-in-class" touch response time for precise pen input. There's built-in Wi-Fi, speakers and an HD camera, everything needed to start collaborating and broadcasting work globally. Jamboard is designed to be a drawing surface to replace traditional whiteboards in offices worldwide. It offers an experience familiar to anyone who has used a whiteboard in the past. Jamboard automatically recognises the difference between sketching with a stylus and using an eraser to start over. Touching existing ink with a finger will wipe it off, just like in real life. According to Google, Jamboard helps teams "get back to the heart of what they love to do" — creating new ideas. It simplifies brainstorming and collaborating, integrating Google's existing productivity tools into a workspace that anyone in the group can participate in. Images, information and content from Google Search, Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides can be pulled directly onto the whiteboard and then shared to every user. Google Jamboard Google Everything created with the Jamboard is saved automatically to Google Drive. Whiteboards can be revisited in the future, preventing information being lost at the end of an meeting. Jamboard itself is similarly convenient to setup. It can be easily wheeled about and is powered by a single cable. "At Google, we’ve set out to redefine meetings," said Google. "So today, we’re introducing Jamboard — a collaborative, digital whiteboard that makes it easy for your team to share ideas in real-time and create without boundaries. We’re moving the whiteboard to the cloud." Jamboard is the first hardware to become part of Google's G Suite. Google is following Microsoft in digitising the whiteboard, stepping up its productivity software by creating a specialised device to accompany it. Microsoft and Google are currently very close rivals in cloud-based collaboration and document authoring. The launch of Jamboard in response to Microsoft's Surface Hub ensures Google is competing on every level. Google Jamboard Google Surface Hub is available in two different sizes, 55-inches and 84-inches. It's designed to be fixed to a wall though, unlike the more versatile Jamboard. Both support pen and touch input and have very deep integration with their creators' software. At "under $6,000" Jamboard is significantly cheaper than the $7,000 55-inch Surface Hub. The two devices also have slightly different focuses. While the Surface Hub is targeted more at corporate board rooms and high-level meetings, Google is aiming Jamboard at individual teams. It has already convinced a few big names to start using the product. Instrument, Netflix and Spotify have been assisting it throughout the creation of the device. Jamboard will be available to purchase in 2017. Google is partnering with BenQ's network of channels and resellers to distribute the device. It has set up an early adopter program that enables existing G Suite customers to begin trialling Jamboard ahead of its wider launch.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Battle Of Siri And Google Pixel’s Assistant Posted: Oct 25 2016, 8:29am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     Google Pixel phones are the first official devices to host the Google Assistant. This feature is a machine learning artificial assistant built directly inside of it. The company wishes the Google Assistant to be personalized. It performs basic tasks for the user, continues conversations and of course performs search queries. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals YouTuber Marques Brownlee decided to put the New Google Assistant to test by putting both in to a head to head competition with the latest version of Siri from the iPhone 7 Plus. In the video, the YouTuber placed both devices side-by-side and turned them on at the same time. He gave them a combination of queries and commands just to test how each one of them responds. The YouTuber starts with simple tasks such as checking the weather, finishing off math equations, managing apps and even setting timers. He then takes a step further on to advanced queries such as asking what is the closing time of a post office, stock prices and who is the current President the United States. When the assistants figure out whom the president is, Brownlee asks the assistants a simple question as to how tall he is. The Google Assistant correctly answered how tall President Barack Obama was however Siri had to go for a Bing Search. When Siri was asked how tall President Barack Obama is, Siri could not answer immediately and instead searched how tall United States is. When the YouTuber put the question more directly, both the assistants are able to answer the query without any major problems. Furthermore Brownlee tries to continue with a contextual conversation with the assistants. Google Assistant correctly identified as to who won the Super Bowl query and the team’s current quarter back. However, Siri was not able to connect both the queries but when asked if the Los Angeles Clippers won? Siri gave a list of the most recent clippers game while Google Assistant gave in an old list from the previous season. Google Assistant also found difficulty in identifying the song which was playing. Brownlee continues the testing with contextual questions such as information about Kathmandu and the Facebook CEO. Siri and Google Assistant both were able to keep up. They understood context and were able to link up connecting queries. The conclusion of the video is that Brownlee tries talking to both Siri and Google and inquires how they are doing and if they are able to make a sandwich for him, crack a joke and so on. Surprisingly Google Assistant was able to come on a more personal level and was able to joke around with Brownlee. Brownlee concluded that the Google Assistant was able to reach a more personal level rather than Siri. It was able to keep up with context and even tell jokes. On the other hand he felt Siri was able to give more information with help of graphs and visual information. Siri was able to present the information required while Google Assistant was much more talkative and interactive,reading out information instead of giving visual cues. Apple has been improving Siri over the previous years. It has included more functions and has opened it too third party applications. In August Apple claimed that machine learning technique has cut Siri’s error rate almost by half. However rumors have recently suggested that Apple is improving Siri’s functionality so that it can be included in an Amazon Echo like smart home device. Apple has opened up employment opportunities for machine learning and AI divisions over the past few months to improve Siri.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Google’s Jamboard takes on the Microsoft Surface Hub with a lower price -1 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Oct 25, 2016 at 16:34 GMT3 weeks ago Google today introduced its new Jamboard device for its business customers to take on Microsoft’s Surface Hub. The search giant’s Jamboard essentially does most of the same things as Microsoft’s Surface Hub — but, of course, the Jamboard runs Google services. Jamboard is part of Google’s G Suite which means it comes with Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Photos and it’s also integrated with Google Drive. Similar to the Surface Hub, Jamboard allows users to sketch and collaborate easily using the stylus that comes with the device. The main difference between the Surface Hub and Jamboard is the specs and the price, however. Jamboard comes with a 55-inch 4K Ultra HD Touch Display, supports passive stylus and finger recognition, USB 2.0, 3.0, Type C, Bluetooth, NFC, and HDMI 2.0. The device also comes with a wide-angle HD camera for video calls (presumably powered by Google Hangouts). On the other hand, the Microsoft Surface Hub comes includes a 55-inch display, Intel Core i5, two wide-angle cameras, USB 3.0, 3.0, and two Surface Pens. Another small difference between both of the devices is the fact that Microsoft Surface Hub’s display supports 100 touch points while the Google Jamboard supports only 16 touch points. There are a couple of differences when it comes to the software, too — Google’s Jamboard comes with a custom version of Android Marshmallow (latest is Nougat), while Microsoft’s Surface Hub is powered by Windows 10 Team. On the Surface Hub, users are able to download and install Universal Windows Apps from the Windows Store — however, you can’t install any third-party apps on the Google Jamboard which is a big letdown. Google’s Jamboard does come with a neat companion app which will be available for Android and iOS that will allow users to work on the whiteboard in real-time — this is a feature which you can’t get on the Surface Hub (but you can collaborate on the Surface Hub whiteboard via Skype for Business). Google says the Jamboard will be shipping next year for $6,000 — that’s $3,000 less than Microsoft’s Surface Hub which is available for $9,000.

While the Daydream View VR headset is similar to the Samsung Gear VR in that it requires phones in order to use properly, Google is also working on a standalone VR headset that doesn’t require a phone to use. Think Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. A new report from Engadget suggests that since the Daydream VR headset has shipped, Google has increased its focus on this standalone headset. People familiar with the matter said Google is working to integrate eye tracking with sensors and algorithms to map out real-world space in front of people. This is more than just virtual reality, this is augmented reality. With the new tech, Google will be able to display digital items alongside a person’s real-world environment. This lines up with what we know about Google’s VR efforts from the outside, as today eye tracking company Eyefluence announced that they’ve been acquired by Google to “advance eye-interaction technology to expand human potential and empathy on an even larger scale.” That’s a pretty broad statement, but it’s not a big leap of logic to assume that the team will be helping Google with their standalone headset.

In partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Otto shipped 45,000 Budweisers 120 miles from the company's facility in Loveland, Colo., to a weigh station in Fort Collins. Though there was a professional driver in the truck the entire time, he never had to intervene and the truck was able to drive itself from exit to exit, according to the company. The software is programmed to hand off control to the human driver when the truck needs to exit the freeway. "By embracing this technology, both organizations are actively contributing to the creation of a safer and more efficient transportation network," Otto co-founder Lior Ron said in a statement. "We are excited to have reached this milestone together, and look forward to further rolling out our technology on the nation's highways." It's the first trip of its kind. While several companies -- including Otto -- have completed numerous fully autonomous trips along freeways, no one had completed an autonomous commercial delivery. That means, though several sources pegged Uber's acquisition of Otto as mostly an "acqhire" of Otto's team, specifically co-founder Anthony Levandowski, Uber is now growing more serious about the trucking business. It's a smart move for the company, which has worked to diversify its revenue streams with on-demand delivery and B2B services in an increasingly crowded ride-hail market. The partnership just covers this single pilot trip, for which Anheuser-Busch paid Otto $470, so it's not the partnership itself that's significant. But rather that Otto's autonomous technology, at least, is close to being market-ready. This rush-to-market approach is true to the DNA of Otto, a now barely one-year-old company. Otto's founders - Ron, Levandowski, Don Burnette, and Claire Delaunay - are former Google veterans who worked on everything from maps to the self-driving car project. In fact, Levandowski was one of the original members of Google's self-driving team. As of its initial launch in May of 2016, the company's ambitions were clear: The team was intent on bringing self-driving technology to market as fast as possible. Call it a reaction to working at a company that has yet to ship a product in spite of working on the technology for close to eight years. That's why the company decided to go into trucking. Trucks largely operate on freeways - an environment in which many companies, including Google, have mastered driving autonomously to a degree - and thus it is faster to develop and deploy the technology in trucks than it would be in passenger cars meant to navigate city streets. Now, fresh off being acquired by Uber, Otto is moving quickly to commercialize its technology. The company has already begun ramping up its on-demand logistics service for trucks, called UberFreight. Essentially, the way it will work is Otto, care of Uber, will match either independent drivers or fleet managers who have room on their trucks with freight that needs to be shipped. A trademark filing describes UberFreight as a "freight brokerage service" that also includes "[hardware and software] units for automated and semi-automated driving of vehicles" and "leasing of vehicles and trailers." Based on this description, it seemed likely that Otto will simply be known as UberFreight going forward because the trademark Otto filed in March 2016 was nearly identical. But the company says the service itself will be called UberFreight while the trucks will be under the Otto name. According to Ron -- who spoke to Recode on a recent visit to the company's headquarters in San Francisco -- though the company may be working closely with Uber on ramping up the freight matching platform, Otto has remained largely independent. That's because beyond some of the fundamental aspects of the technology, little about Uber X and UberPool translates directly to Otto's business. Instead, Levandowski has taken control of Uber's self-driving operations while also helping to manage Otto. However, honing an on-demand platform - like honing self-driving technology - is no easy task. Just ask Uber, which has been working on improving its software since 2009. For now, UberFreight will launch as a two-sided marketplace for truck drivers and freight needing to be shipped, without much of the autonomous technology. Think of it as the same path that Uber took to perfect its technology for its traditional services - establishing both supply and demand and smoothing out the routing algorithms - before beginning its foray into self-driving cars. But UberFreight won't be the only "Uber for trucking" company on the road. Several companies attempting to solve the same logistical dilemma have sprung up, including Convoy, which has so far raised close to $19 million in funding. When asked about competing with Uber, Convoy co-founder and CEO Dan Lewis said: "It will be interesting to see how Uber will use Otto's self-driving technology. Convoy focuses on building great relationships with trucking companies and drivers, many of whom are also exploring emerging self-driving solutions. We are evaluating these options, among others, and we continue to use technology to improve our experience for shippers and carriers." From ramping up and launching the fledgling version of UberFreight to finding partners and suppliers to manufacture the hardware which the company builds in-house for now, there is still a lot to be done before Otto or UberFreight becomes a full-fledged commercial self-driving service. © 2016 Re/Code under contract with NewsEdge.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Next Google VR may be a standalone, wireless headset with AR integrated By R Padla - October 25, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Will Google release a standalone VR headset? That’s what most people have been asking since the tech giant released the Daydream View. The latter works only with a compatible Android smartphone. What Google is expected to launch soon is a wearable device that won’t need a phone inside but something more like an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive but hopefully, without the high price tag. We can dream but for now, it’s just Daydream View. We know the company has plans for such and that it has started gathering people to work on the product. There’s no official announcement yet but we learned that the future VR device will utilize algorithms, sensors, and eye tracking together to map out the real-word. The technology aims to “view” what is actually in front of the user, integrating augmented reality and virtual reality. Yes, the two are different but they can very well be incorporated together especially in a VR headset. A report by Engadget noted that Movidius will be supplying the chips. Intel is now in the process of acquiring the AI company so we can say this early the next VR device will be powered by Intel. It may not run the Daydream VR platform as the headset will be a totally different and standalone product. There’s also the idea that it could be wireless. You see, there’s a mysterious device sighted on the FCC. It was recently approved but there’s not much mention of the specs or features. The only indication that it’s a Google product is the Mike Jazayeri name as the contact person. In case you didn’t know Jazayeri, he is Google VR’s Director of Product Management. We know Google isn’t the only company thinking of releasing a new VR device. Actually, there are other virtual reality headsets already available in the market but they haven’t made it commercially yet. But when Google finally announces and releases a standalone headset whether expensive or affordable, we know the world will take notice. This time, it will incorporate augmented reality–or not.

The trigger, somewhat inevitably, was the appearance of Kayak co-founder and CEO, Steve Hafner, at the WebInTravel conference in Singapore. In remarks on-stage, Hafner claimed there are “three too many metasearch brands out there at the moment” out of what he considers the five leaders in the market. The five, in his opinion, are: TripAdvisor, Skyscanner, Qunar, Trivago and, of course, Kayak. Another metasearch service that some would suggest is worth throwing into the pile is Google – although how important a player it is for hotels or flights will inevitably ignite very polarised opinions. On Google, Hafner says it is “by far the biggest” in terms of brand, but that it is still ten to 15 years behind Kayak when it comes to functionality. Cheeky swipes aside, suggesting that the aforementioned five should somehow be reduced to just two global players is, to some, an extraordinary proposition. And, inevitably, throws up a large range of possibilities and permutations. Following Hafner’s comments earlier this week in Singapore (but unlikely to be connected), a report with the inevitable “people familiar with the situation” sources on Bloomberg suggested that the Priceline Group would be interested in acquiring Skyscanner, or that the Edinburgh, UK-based company is gearing up to list on the public markets. The first scenario – Priceline Group buying Skyscanner – would be, at least from a PR perspective, an unfortunate one given that Hafner had labelled his arch rival “goons” on-stage. The second has been speculated about for at least five years, probably more. Earlier, on the same day as Hafner’s remarks, a panel of travel search brands, including Wego, Hotelscombined, Travel.jp and TripAdvisor, also had the “consolidation” angle thrown at it. Qunar co-founder Fritz Demopoulos (who now runs Queen’s Road Capital) was the only member of the group that would speak openly about how the market might evolve. “There are a lot of metasearch brands out there,” he says, “so it makes sense.” But, adding somewhat tantalisingly: “The fact that someone hasn’t pulled the trigger yet is telling.” And this is where the debate gets somewhat controversial. There are some who believe that many of the travel search brands in the market (considered “second tier”) simply do not have the volume or focus on a particular sector (hotels or flights) to catch the eye of others in a consolidation scenario where the outlay would warrant the effort or financial outlay. But what about the main players, those that Hafner places in the five-down-to-two market? It seems inconceivable that such a major shrinking of the ownership of the market could take place easily and quickly. This, whilst it may happen at some point, is very much a long-term play. There is also the widely held belief that the power rests in those that have scale in the hotel search market, rather than flights, a vertical which is well-known for having slimmer margins than its accommodation counterpart. As one observer notes: “The most attractive brands are going to be those that have created sizeable businesses, with plenty of room for further growth in a specific sector, or have managed to build a substantial presence in a particular region – rather than those that have spread themselves thinly.” What is very much a reality is the strong likelihood of Trivago heading for its own foray into the public financial markets in the near future. As Lorraine Sileo, senior vice president of research of Phocuswright, says during an on-stage discussion this week: “We should keep an eye of the Trivago IPO. That will be a good signal of the value of the market.” Travel search spent a long time trying to establish itself as more than the noisy child of the industry, but as an important part of the travel marketing and distribution ecosystem – the turning point probably being when the Priceline Group bought Kayak for $1.8 billion in November 2012. But in the following four years, Expedia Inc (through its $632 million investment in Trivago) and TripAdvisor (with its own significant switch to hotel metasearch) have also woken up and realised that there is an awful lot on the table that can be used in the increasingly global power play in travel. Travel search is perhaps on the verge of truly growing up, leaving home, and heading for higher education with some of its powerful friends.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Kevin May Kevin is senior editor and a co-founder at Tnooz.

Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website Oz Har Adir I would focus on the product segmentation, customer value and segment value. On flights, Skyscanner & Kayak ‘share’ control in most of the world, and they are the only ones who stand a chance to compete with Google Flights. Flight booking is an objective decision and the product is based on straightforward algorithmic problems (how to connect rates, how to display offers quickly etc), sheer computing power, and access to users at the top of the funnel. This is Google’s home court and only focus and perhaps some industry resistance (less access to supply) stood in its way to become the clear leader here, but it will happen. Google flights is already the better product out there in most usage aspects. Skyscanner & Kayak have descent product, good supply and large enough loyal audiences to play ball, but I would not bet on anyone else in the west making a dent there. In any case, the segment as a whole is worth $5-10Bn, ~50-75% is/will be owned by Google. Hotels is a completely different story… Trivago operates one model, which is a hotel only metasearch that is based solely on CPC, and is focused on high volume traffic in the peak of the season. While they’ve done rather well for themselves, they haven’t turned much profits despite enormous investment, and are completely dependent on both Booking and Expedia brands to aggressively play along, which has mostly been the case, but not always (Agoda pulled out for a while, for instance). Tripadvisor and Google are each developing their own mold of ‘enhanced’ meta-search, but do it from the perspective of monetization of their existing traffic, and not from a user-centric approach. (which user would recommend to her colleague to go to Tripadvisor because she ”can book Booking’s inventory on their UI right there!”). In both cases, they are strong players for other reasons, but by no means where visitors make their hotel booking decisions out-right, but some part of the supply discovery. Skyscanner, Kayak, Momondo etc all treat hotels as a complimentary niche. Their products are ‘fine’, their business model ‘so-so’, but this is not a tool consumers crave for or have any reason to choose. Thus, the total hotel metasearch market value is in the $1-5Bn range (more if you considered Google hotel business or Tripadvisor as a whole, but they can do just fine with other hotel models too…). Compare that to the hotel OTA niche that is worth +$100Bn in the west alone, and probably ~$50Bn in the rest of the world. Thus, I think that evolving the hotel metasearch model is much more interesting topic than mulling over potential consolidation within it or within the flights niche 🙂 Reply 3 weeks ago   Christian Ljungström Then we have some big local metas. Some of them are huge on their markets. Momondo is big in Scandinavia. Aviasales (Jetradar) in Russia and Idealo in Germany. And Kayak isn’t a great success in Europe. Kayak is more a North American phenomena. As Qunar in China. I think more Skyscanner is the only meta that has a global bridgehead. Skyscanner is the only meta actor that globally stands out. Reply 3 weeks ago   Julian Gurfinkiel Christian, In Latam we have also huge metas on their markets: Turismocity in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, Mundi in Brazil.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed DirtyCOW Linux hole works on Android too – “root at will” 25 Oct 2016 8 Google, Security threats, Vulnerability Post navigation Previous: Apple iOS users taste Android anxiety with nasty CoreGraphics image flaw Next: IoT chickens come home to roost by Paul Ducklin 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Late last week, we wrote about a newly-patched Linux security exploit dubbed DirtyCOW. Super-simply, the attack works like this: Choose two files, one you can write to and one you can’t, and get the kernel to load them both into memory. Write over and over again into the file you’re allowed to change. At the same time, tell the kernel over and over again that it can borrow back the memory used for the file you can’t change. Wait a short while. (A fraction of a second in our tests on 32-bit Intel Linux 4.4.19.) The vulnerability, officially called CVE-2016-5195, means that the kernel will eventually mix up the memory buffer that you’re writing into with the memory buffer you’re saying you don’t really need any more. As a result, you get to overwrite the read-only file, which is something of a security catastrophe if it’s a critical system executable or configuration file. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More This bug was in the Linux source code for the the last eleven years of kernel releases, and in theory affected every version on every platform during that time. We only tested it on what you might call a “regular” Linux distribution (for Intel CPUs), but it turns out that DirtyCOW affects Android running on ARM chips as well. That’s because Google’s largely proprietary Android ecosystem is built on top of the open-source Linux operating system, in much the same way as Apple’s macOS and iOS are built on a BSD-derived open-source core. A Github user going by Timwr has published a proof-of-concept project that shows how to replace the Android program called run-as. The idea of run-as is to allow an application to be run as if launched by a different user, just like Run As... on Windows. That’s useful in development and testing, but it’s also dangerous because run-as automatically acquires root privileges when it starts, and can pass its rootness on to the apps it loads. To keep things safe, the standard Google version of run-as therefore requires the user who started it to be root in the first place, as would be the case on a typical development or test device connected up for debugging. Loosely speaking, then, you can use run-as to root a phone, but only if the phone is already rooted in the first place. Clearly, replacing the admin-capable run-as program with a version that can be started by any user creates a gateway to root a phone permanently. The risk of rooting Google’s own Nexus and Pixel devices are sold so that they can be rooted if you like, and are thus commonly used by developers, but other vendors such as Samsung keep their phones locked down, Apple-and-Microsoft style. As a result, rooting – like its close cousin jailbreaking on Apple phones – is a popular pastime for users who want to do things differently. For many, it’s a way to remove what they see as vendor bloatware or to replace system apps with leaner, meaner or merely different variants. For others it’s a way to apply security patches that the vendor hasn’t got round to yet, or to update phones that the vendor no longer supports at all. And for some, sadly, it’s a gateway to piracy and other scofflaw shenanigans, including carelessly installing maliciously-hacked apps and making ill-advised configuration changes that introduce security problems that would otherwise have been avoided. In particular, an app that can “get root” can work around the data sandboxing restrictions imposed on regular Android apps, and thereby access files such as logs, messages, databases and other possibly personally identifiable information (PII) that would usually be off-limits. What to do? If you genuinely want to root your vendor-locked Android phone, DirtyCOW could be a handy way to get the job done, at least until your vendor’s next security update – though on some devices, that might be a dangerously long time. On the other hand, if you are a sysadmin looking after a menagerie of corporate devices, where the likely risk of rooting outweighs any potential benefits, you might not be so delighted at the prospect of easily-rooted devices. Worse still, dodgy off-market apps sometimes secretly use root exploits to get more power than you agreed to give them at install time, which is a danger to any organisation’s network. We suggest that you ask your Android phone vendors when their DirtyCOW updates will be available. PS. Sophos Mobile Control can help you to keep rooted phones off your business network by detecting that they’ve been rooted and taking corrective action. That could range from a simple popup warning, through the automatic removal of corporate email, to a forced remote wipe.

Great article Paul Ducklin, nice sharing! Reply Darren Chaker says: October 26, 2016 at 3:42 am As consumer demand the latest and greatest increases to simplify life, security flaws continue to increase with it. I truly wish as the world gets more connected that companies puts its products through serious security evaluations prior to releasing the product. Best, Darren Chaker Reply Alan Robertson says: October 26, 2016 at 10:15 am I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that *** if you know what you are doing *** then a rooted device can be far more secure than an unrooted device. For starters you can run a low level firewall that you can apply rules per application that allow you far more control over what can and cannot access the internet. Why should the android keyboard app have internet access? A low level firewall is only possible by rooting. “No Root” style firewalls work by proxying the traffic and are easily bypassed by malware using their own proxy settings. The same does not apply to a low level firewall. Similarly, anti virus cannot truly function properly at removing stubborn malware as it doesn’t have root privileges to remove the malware. If you are unlucky to run an app that later turns out to be malware and the AV doesn’t have a current signature for it then you are stuck with the malware and cannot effectively remove it. Yes, don’t use third party app stores etc. but it’s not like Google’s app store hasn’t been caught out with malicious apps, is it? You could also argue that removing Google Play from the device and only sticking with the existing apps supplied by the manufacturer is safer still, but I doubt you will find many people willing to do this. Also, what is that vendor supplied app doing on your device? The temptation to spy on users and sell the users habits to other companies is huge – especially if you can subsidise your device and make it cheaper for the consumer. Even if it is “just meta data” it can still reveal a lot about someone, and it’s not like your permission was sought prior to this being done. If the device is rooted then any unwanted apps that are installed by the vendor can be removed easily – again increases security. If malware can use a zero day or some other undocumented feature to access root privileges, then it gains complete control of the device. A rooted phone, on the other hand *** with additional security added *** can thwart the attempts of malware and prevent your device from being owned. As a side note, privacy guard is useful for preventing apps that request access to your personal data with blanket permissions. VPN’s / Orbot are useful for protecting your data in transit by encrypting everything even if the apps / browser are not using TLS. Orbot works best with rooted devices as you can TOR everything as opposed to Orbot aware apps. Choosing a good browser that respects privacy and allows you to change the settings to make it more secure is a good choice. Personally I favour Firefox, but then I’m an open source believer. Some useful Firefox settings: General, Home, Addons, Only over Wi-Fi General, uncheck Full-screen browsing Search, remove Amazon, Qwant, Twitter, Wikipedia Search, set Bing as default (Google asks for captchas all the time with Orbot) Search, uncheck Show search history Privacy, enable Do not Track Privacy, make sure Tracking protection is checked Privacy, Cookies, Enabled, excluding 3rd party Privacy, check Clear private data on exit (select all – you need to choose quit!)

No offence to the Hong Kong post office but the number of CA’s is getting ridiculous these days. Settings, data usage, click menu option, turn on enable data usage alerts and also apply network restrictions to your wifi connections (will warn if large files are being downloaded) Lastly – patch your phone! It’s YOUR responsibility and not the manufacturers to make sure you are safe online. Nor is it your IT departments responsibility to protect you. More to the point, if your phone is compromised and the “bad guys” used your phone to pivot to the company SQL database which ends up on paste bin, well I’m afraid it’s your neck on the chopping block (and IT will happily oblige with log files proving it).

I’m a big Linux fan and I like the ethos of Sophos – particularly the no back door approach to security. I fully recommend the Sophos anti-virus on Linux as I don’t subscribe to the idea that Linux is immune to viruses. I would love to see more products by Sophos – keep up the good work guys! Reply cyber security salary says: October 26, 2016 at 3:02 pm Really interesting Paul, wasn’t aware the nexus was sold with the option of them being rooted! Reply Paul Ducklin says: October 26, 2016 at 4:43 pm You can turn on ADB (the Android Debug Bridge) to allow development access via USB and over a network, you can grant yourself access to a root shell, and you can unlock the bootloader to reflash pretty much any firmware you like. (At your own risk. The wrong firmware could crash the device so badly that you can’t reflash the firmware again, thus giving you an expensive brick.) You use the { } Developer options menu item on the Settings screen, but you have to enable it first. Go to Settings | About phone/tablet, find the Build number item and tap it seven times. Reply ustechninja says: November 10, 2016 at 6:03 pm I just wish more carriers would offer rooted versions of devices so devs didn’t have to exploit.

It has seemed like Apple wanted to keep the app to their own devices through the future, but that may change. Word from the rumor wire suggests that Apple is testing at least one version of iMessage for Android now. “I’ve heard from little birdies,” said Daring Fireball‘s John Gruber, “that mockups of iMessage for Android have circulated within the company.” He went on to suggest that a variety of user interface styles are in testing now, including Google’s Material Design. This is not an unprecedented move, if it does indeed happen. Apple has released apps for Android with Material Design principles in place before – see: Apple Music for Android. SEE: iMessage is not Android’s problem If Apple releases iMessage for Android, they’ll be sending a clear message to Google. Or at least to the Googlers and everyday Android fans that suggest iMessage is Apple’s only must-have app. Gruber mentions that it may have been Steve Jobs that made the decision to say FaceTime would be an “open standard.” That never happened, in part because it wasn’t designed to be open from the beginning. But what we can take from the idea that Steve Jobs wanting FaceTime to be an open standard is that it is possible. Apple doesn’t need its messenger app locked in to its own software ecosystem any more than it needed to keep Apple Music to its own machines. If Apple’s monetization of iMessage is immense enough to make money from Android, they’ll do it. This is the right time to do it, too. Now when messenger apps are important enough to create many different apps on a single platform – by a single company – now is the time. And don’t expect what happened to BlackBerry’s BBM to happen here, not when the company is in such a different position. Look out for iMessage for Android at the next Apple event, but don’t hold your breath. On the 27th of October (this week), Apple will more than likely be showing off their newest in MacBook Pro hardware technology. The only way we’d see iMessage for Android at this event is if Apple also revealed an iPhone SE 2.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Create a Collage, Animation, or Movie with Google Photos on Android Google Photos is a huge improvement over Android’s old “Gallery” app, but it does a lot more than just keep your stuff organized and synced. You can easily manipulate your photos into some very cool, shareable collages, animations, and even movies. If you have a modern Android phone, then you likely have Google’s Photos app installed. If not, you can get it from the Play Store—and you’ll probably want to. It’s more than just a simple photo manager: it’s a backup system, a light editor, and a powerful tool that lets users transform simple photos into something much more meaningful. RELATED ARTICLES Take Control of Your Smartphone’s Automatic Photo Uploads 18 Things You May Not Have Known Google Photos Can Do Most of its power lies in the Assistant feature, which you can access by tapping the “Assistant” link at the very bottom of the main Photos window. From here, there are a variety of things you can do, but we’re going to focus on the top options: Album, Collage, Animation, and Movie. Before we look at those, however, I do want to mention that Photos will often create these things for you under certain circumstances, like when several similar photos are taken together, for example. When this happens, it will generate a notification to let you know; from there, you can delete the animation or save it. It’s neat. But if you want to build something for yourself instead of waiting for Google to do it for you, that’s incredibly easy: just pick one of the top options on the Assistant page. For this example, we’ll put together a collage, but the process is essentially identical across the board. First, choose your option (again, in this case, we’re going with “Collage”). This will open the gallery window, allowing you to select multiple photos. For a collage, you can select between two and nine pictures—for most of the others, you can select up to 50 photos, because that makes more sense for an animation or video. Let’s go with four, because that really just seems like a good number for a collage. Once you’ve selected the photos, go ahead and tap the “Create” button in the top right. A brief progress bar will show up, followed by your new creation. It’s all very, very simple, which is really the biggest benefit and weakness of Assistant: there are very little customization options going on here. For example, in our collage, we didn’t get to select a layout or format—it just slapped the images into a standard 4×4 layout. Sometimes this is fine, but others it may seem lacking. Of course, if you want to do more, there are plenty of tools for the job—Photos’ Assistant is great because it’s so simple. After your collage, animation, or video has been created, it will automatically be saved to your gallery and backed up (assuming your settings allow this, of course).

Just like Microsoft's Surface Hub, Google's Jamboard is a 55-inch 4K touchscreen, but Google is using Android and a new whiteboard app to power its giant display. It's a direct move for Google's continued competition with Microsoft in businesses and the enterprise, and the Jamboard is designed for businesses who already use Google Apps. Google's screen supports up to 16 simultaneous touch inputs (compared to 100 on the Surface hub), and includes a stylus, built-in camera, and speakers. The Jamboard will let Google Apps users create "Jam" sessions to collaborate on documents, and draw, type, or modify them as teams over Google Hangout calls. Grid View Google Jamboard press photos Google isn't revealing the exact specs of its giant touchscreen, but it has some interesting software tricks nonetheless. The Jamboard can sense when you're using your finger to wipe off things from the whiteboard, instead of drawing. There's also a bunch of tools like sticky notes, stencils, and handwriting / shape recognition. You'll also be able to mount the Jamboard like a TV or attach it to a stand to wheel it into meetings. Google has unveiled its Jamboard just a day before Microsoft is expected to launch its own desktop PC, but the search giant isn't ready to release it just yet. Google says the Jamboard will be available "under $6,000" in 2017, which is less than the $8,999 Microsoft charges for its 55-inch Surface Hub.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured Google forays into Virtual Reality arena by acquiring Eyefluence By Anand Narayanaswamy - 25/10/2016 Google has acquired a California-based eye-tracking company named Eyefluence as part of its efforts to foray into the Virtual Reality space. According to sources, the search engine giant has picked up a core technology that might move its virtual reality (VR) ambitions closer to the masses. In a blog post, Eyefluence disclosed that they are joining hands with Alphabet Inc. The company is working to enable eye movements to control digital screens. The company is still in its infancy since it has been incorporated just three years back. According to analysts, the company had reportedly raised $21.6 million in funding. However, they declined to reveal as to for how much amount Google bought the company. Meanwhile, Google also confirmed the acquisition when asked about the same via email. To recall, Eyefluence was founded by Jim Marggraff, the creator of the pioneering LeapPad tablet computer. He started the venture after buying assets from neurological research firm Eye-Com. He revealed before the media that the start-up has been established to enable people to manipulate objects and digital screens with their eye movements. In the virtual and augmented reality, the use of functional eye-tracking mechanism is gaining great attention. The technology works in such a way that digital images interact with the physical world. However, the company is working on to overcome challenges in the implementation of the new technology. These include latency and accessibility issues. In the recent times, Google has invested aggressively in VR by launching customized software. Moreover, the company had launched its own mobile headset. The company is also gearing up to invest in Magic Leap, which specializes in the eye interaction technology.

(Katherine Peralta/Charlotte Observer) - Google has launched its Google Express two-day delivery service in the Charlotte area. Charlotte’s part of a larger expansion of the service throughout the Southeast, said Brian Elliott, Google Express general manager. As of Tuesday, the service covers 90 percent of the U.S. Google Express is available on google.com/express, or as a smartphone app. The tech giant is offering two payment options for the service: Membership is $95 a year, or the pay-as-you-go option, which starts at $4.99 an order. For users who sign up by Nov. 25, Google Express will offer six months of free delivery. Locally, the service is starting off with about 15 merchants in the Charlotte area, including Costco, Whole Foods, Kohl’s, PetSmart, Walgreens and more. The plan is to expand beyond that, though, Elliott said. “We’re starting with national players because that’s the easiest way for us to build out a first point of entry, but over time we’d really like to get more retailers that are local to the Charlotte area involved,” Elliott said. Competition has intensified among tech companies offering home delivery in Charlotte. Last April, for example, Amazon expanded same-day delivery service for its Prime users in the Charlotte area. Smaller companies like Shipt and Instacart have also launched their grocery delivery services locally. “People like to shop from a wide range of retailers. We want to make it easier for them to connect to those merchants, and we also want to give those merchants a platform to connect more easily with customers,” Elliott said.

Baig , USA TODAY 9:28 p.m. EDT October 25, 2016 Google hopes Jamboard will encourage digital collaboration and teamwork. (Photo: Jon Cooper) NEW YORK — Google is trying to push teamwork to the cloud and is doing so via a new digital whiteboard. Tuesday, Google unveiled Jamboard, a 55-inch, 4K, digital whiteboard on wheels, built to encourage brainstorming and real-time collaboration among business people, both in person and remotely. “We’ve set out to redefine meetings,” TJ Varghese, Jamboard product manager, wrote in a blog post introducing the whiteboard. Jamboard ties into Google’s cloud-based productivity-oriented G Suite of apps (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides, Calendar, Keep, Sites) and is essentially the Alphabet-owned company’s answer to Microsoft’s Office 365. Until recently, G Suite was known as Google Apps for Work. The one-time $6,000 cost of Jamboard includes the display itself, a wall mount, two styli, one eraser, manual, cables and adapters and a tray. By way of comparison, rival Microsoft currently sells its 55-inch Surface Hub whiteboard for $8,999. Jamboard can recognize handwriting and the shapes that folks draw and includes various tools such as on-screen sticky notes and stencils. It has a high-definition camera, speakers and built in Wi-Fi that lets work teams brainstorm globally through Google Hangouts. Meeting participants can also use a companion iOS or Android smartphone or tablet app and store their work iin the cloud via Google Drive. Jamboard is on wheels  (Photo: Google) According to Google, the touchscreen automatically recognizes the difference between using the stylus to sketch or the eraser to delete your work, and neither requires batteries or needs to be paired. You can also use your finger to wipe work off the screen. G Suite customers Instrument, Netflix and Spotify were beta testers on Jamboard, which will be available next year — Google isn’t saying precisely when. For now, Google is working with exclusive with BenQ in selecting the resellers who will sell Jamboard. Google's promotional video here shows off Jamboard in action.

The product is called 'Jamboard,' an allusion to its goal of replacing the physical whiteboards that companies have been setting up in meeting rooms for decades.  It boasts a 55-inch, ultrahigh-definition screen capable of recognizing the difference between when someone is writing on it with a stylus or touching it with a finger. Scroll down for video  This image provided by Google shows a demonstration of the company's new product called 'Jamboard.' Google has designed the giant touch-screen canvas for companies trying to make it easier for their employees to brainstorm as they work on team projects and other assignments. Google is releasing the device to a small group of companies Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, before making it widely available in early 2017. (Google via AP) HOW IT WORKS  As with a whiteboard, employees can post their ideas, documents and images on the Jamboard, only they won't need markers, tape or sticky notes to do it.  Instead, they can use their fingers, a stylus or smartphones and smaller tablets to share information and content from anywhere with an online connection.  All the work posted on a Jamboard can be saved in Google's online storage service, Drive.

Jamboard reinforces Google's push to make its own gear in an attempt to hook more people on its software and other digital services.  Until this fall, Google had teamed up with other manufacturers whenever it made a phone or other gadget. The Jamboard comes with two pens, and a digital eraser - but fingers can also be used But Google just rolled out a fancy smartphone called the Pixel that it designed itself. Soon it will start selling an internet-connected speaker called Home.  Both those devices feature a digital assistant powered by Google's artificial-intelligence programs.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant.

Just last week, Facebook announced it was integrating food delivery in its app, allowing users to order delivery without actually logging out of Facebook. Now, Google is doing it, too: With an update that allows users to order food delivery directly through Google Maps. Google Maps for iOS version 4.24.0 allows users to place local delivery orders using a selection of on-demand food delivery services, including Seamless and Grubhub. As Apple Insider notes, the app's Explore feature “surfaces nearby eateries serving breakfast, lunch, coffee, dinner and drinks.” Users can then refine those restaurants further, choosing from sub-categories like “Where the Locals Eat” or “Vegetarian-Friendly Spots.” If delivery is available at a particular restaurant, it will show up on that restaurant’s info card, along with a “Order” link. Click the link and the app will ask the user to continue via a third-party delivery app (i.e. Seamless, Grubhub, DoorDash, etc.) Google Maps now has an order food category. Hmm. Interesting. pic.twitter.com/25zzliGlvP— Romit Mehta (@TheRomit) October 24, 2016 Facebook launched a similar service just last week, which allows users to order food for delivery without ever leaving the Facebook app. The new system went into effect on October 19, and, for now, can only be used on the Facebook pages of restaurants that use food delivery services Delivery.com and Slice. • Google Maps Gets Food Delivery, Plus Code Integration in Update [Apple Insider] • Facebook Traps Hungry Users by Offering Food Delivery Within Its App [E] • All Google Coverage [E] More From Eater Watch: How to Turn Leftover Sashimi Into Beer-Battered Fish Tacos Supported By The Eater Guide to the Whole Entire World The 23 Most Anticipated Restaurant Openings of Fall 2016 Escaping the Restaurant Industry's Motherhood Trap The 24-Year-Old Coca-Cola Virgin The Biggest New Cookbooks of 2016 Most Read Read Restaurateur Danny Meyer’s Post-Election Letter to Employees My Cast-Iron Conversion This Year's Starbucks Red Cups Are Festive AF This Article has a component height of 12.

 Google just released a 55-inch digital whiteboard that could cost almost $6,000 Eugene Kim Oct. 25, 2016, 12:00 PM 11,036 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google JamboardGoogle Google's first hardware product release under its newly branded G Suite work application team is a massive digital whiteboard. Called the Jamboard, the 55-inch display screen looks like a giant tablet, only it's connected to Google's cloud and comes with collaboration tools that let multiple people in different locations access and share material through the device.  The Wi-Fi-connected Jamboard starts with a blank white screen where you can write and draw stuff using a stylus marker (you can erase with your finger or a separate eraser). You can drag and drop photos or PDF files, and pull in files directly from Google Drive. It can also do photo searches or web searches within the device, making it a one-stop shop for all work-related searches. Once that material's on the white board, people in the room can annotate it using the same stylus they'd use to create a new drawing from scratch. Because everything on the screen is stored in Google's cloud, rather than the device itself, that means people can access it from multiple locations at once. So, for instance, somebody in New York could share the white screen with someone using a smartphone in San Francisco, who would access it through the G Suite app (compatible with both iOS and Android), and they could add content in real time simultaneously — just as teams can do with G Suite products like Google Docs today. The content on the whiteboard ends up getting saved under a new file format called JAM, so people could save it or pass it around. You can also do a live video conversation through a Google Hangout, which is also embedded in the device. Google JamboardGoogle   Google said the goal of Jamboard is to make work collaboration easier, so people can remotely participate in meetings using a whiteboard, and not have to travel to contribute their ideas. But it's also another way for Google to lock up its G Suite users within its ecosystem.  Google says early beta testing results have been great so far, as companies like Netflix and Spotify, as well as 30 internal teams have given positive feedback. Eventually, it hopes to turn Jamboard into a broader work platform where developers build apps specificilly optimized for the digital whiteboard – and make meetings and collaboration more efficient. Jamboard will be available to G Suite customers under an early adopter program on Tuesday, and will be on sale starting early 2017. Although Google didn't specify the exact price, Jamboard won't come cheap as the company only said it'll be "under $6,000." The separate stylus marker and eraser tools will each cost an additional $9.99. G Suite's director of product Jonathan Rochelle said that the final price could change, and even be offered at a discount to certain markets, like schools. He said the team is first starting off in the business market to ensure they find the best use-case and price-point, but pointed out some of the teachers who tested the product expressed interest at the current price range. "Their feeling is if they could get a couple of these at student collaboration stations for $10,000, they would do it in a minute," Rochelle said.

The Pixel phone is great, Google Home and Google Wi-Fi look promising, and Chromecast is already really popular. Now comes Jamboard, a modern spin on an old-school tool: the whiteboard. The 55-inch 4K touchscreen is the first hardware product in Google’s rebranded G Suite of cloud-based tools—you know, things like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Docs. Those tools make long-distance collaboration easy online, but that can break down once everyone is in the same room. People have to agree which tool to use, and trying to sort it all out hampers spontaneity. “We thought that might somehow limit creativity,” says Jonathan Rochelle, director of product for G Suite. “It made it so that when people wanted to be creative and collaborative, they can’t do the same thing at the same time. That bothered us, because the reason you’re in a meeting is to collaborate.” Others have riffed on the digital whiteboard—Sharp’s Aquos Board and Microsoft’s Surface Hub come to mind. The difference here is how Google’s tools and cloud services tie it all together. Launch a Jamboard session and people can join in from anywhere using the Jamboard app on an Android or iOS device. They see a real-time feed from the board and can add text, photos, and drawings to the mix. The leader of the session can share it all with Google Hangout participants. The big-screen Jamboard session is essentially replicated on the tablet: You can add things, rearrange them, and pull in images or maps from a side menu. The interactions are limited on a phone, but you see everything on the board in real time, and you can add text or create digital sticky notes. One major limitation is that you can’t really chip in on a laptop or desktop: You can watch a Jam session unfold in a browser, but you can only contribute via the mobile apps. You can drive a meeting from a tablet, but the massive Jamboard is the ultimate mission control. It includes two chunky passive stylii that feel like sidewalk chalk in your hand, and the screen is pressure-sensitive when you’re writing on it. Magnets keep the stylii and microfiber eraser nestled on Jamboard’s metal base, but don’t worry if Steve from accounting swipes them. Any rubber-tipped stylus works, and you can use your hand to erase things. Everything is saved to Google Drive, an essential convenience because Jamboard doesn’t have internal memory. Select the “handwriting-to-text” tool before you start scribbling and Jamboard does an impressive job converting your scrawl to searchable text. And it can straighten your lines, shapes, and symbols so everything looks neat and tidy. From the board, you can dial in participants via Google Hangouts and search for images, maps, videos, and web pages to drag and drop into a Jam session. An HD camera above the screen lets you snap pics or selfies, while HDMI inputs and built-in Chromecast let you Netflix and chill in the comfort of your boardroom. You’ll need to wait a while before you buying this physical embodiment of Google Wave because it won’t be widely available until next year. It’ll cost less than $6,000 at that point, but you can register today to be part of the early-adopter program. In the meantime, you’ll just have to use your analog whiteboard. Go Back to Top.

Eyefluence, founded in 2013 by serial entrepreneurs Jim Marggraff and David Stiehr, develops eye-interaction technologies to control VR and AR headsets. "Eyes can instantaneously transform intent into action, enabling communication as fast as you can see," the company says. The deal with Google was announced Tuesday. "With our forces combined, we will continue to advance eye-interaction technology to expand human potential and empathy on an even larger scale," Eyefluence said in a blog post. Google released its Cardboard smartphone VR visor in mid-2014 and its Daydream View VR headset in early October. The company is also reportedly working on a high-end VR headset. The deal allows Google to put Eyefluence's technology into VR and AR products like Daydream, allowing third-party developers and publishers to use it as part of the Google's UI toolkit, said Lewis Ward, research director for gaming and VR/AR at IDC. Still, there are some questions on how eye control of VR and AR systems will work, he said by email. "I'm still not sure how they tell [that] you want to 'double-click,' as opposed to simply look at something for a long time, but it does make sense to leverage the eyes as a viral part of the AR/VR UI scheme moving forward," Ward added. Google and Eyefluence didn't disclose the terms of the deal.

 Apple has seriously considered iMessage for Android Kif Leswing Oct. 25, 2016, 11:21 AM 8,276 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple has created "mockups" of its iMessage app for Android, suggesting that the company has seriously considered at some point porting the service to non-Apple products. "I’ve heard from little birdies that mockups of iMessage for Android have circulated within the company, with varying UI styles ranging from looking like the iOS Messages app to pure Material Design," Apple-focused writer John Gruber wrote on Monday. Material Design is the official design language Google's apps use.  "Messages for Android may never see the light of day, but the existence of detailed mockups strongly suggests that there’s no 'of course not' to it," he continued.  iMessage is one of Apple's most important services. For many people, messages are the most used app on their phone. The genius to Apple's "hidden social network" is that it replaces the text app: if you're texting someone who has an iPhone, it automatically turns into an iMessage, and turns the message from a green text bubble into a blue text bubble.  There are countless stories of people who have switched to Apple products exclusively so that they can join iMessage groups or send blue bubbles. And in the recent update to iOS, Apple spent a lot of time improving the iMessage experience, adding new stickers, apps, and features.  iMessage only runs on Apple products, including the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and an Android port been rumored several times in the past. Apple doesn't make many Android apps; Apple Music is the most notable. But an Android version of iMessage still doesn't made sense — Apple makes the vast majority of its money when people buy its products. iMessage is a strong reason to continue buying those products. There are also security implications if iMessage were to run on Android, given that the system uses Apple hardware to help its encryption.  As a "senior executive" told the Verge earlier this year: When I asked a senior Apple executive why iMessage wasn’t being expanded to other platforms, he gave two answers. First, he said, Apple considers its own user base of 1 billion active devices to provide a large enough data set for any possible AI learning the company is working on. And, second, having a superior messaging platform that only worked on Apple devices would help sales of those devices — the company’s classic (and successful) rationale for years. Still, it sounds like Apple assigned someone internally to answer the question: If iMessage was ported to Android, what would it look like?  SEE ALSO: APPLE EARNINGS: What's expected from Apple tonight NOW WATCH: How the ‘perfect body’ for men has changed over the last 150 years Loading video...

The team of researchers behind the machine is also using the images in an experiment designed to find the root of horror. The DeepDream algorithm transfers a photograph of the Eiffel Tower in Paris to a horror scene, in a style called 'Fright Night', according to the website. 'We use state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to learn how haunted houses, or toxic cities look like,' the researchers said This GIF shows how the DeepDream algorithm transfers a photograph of the Eiffel Tower in Paris to a horror scene in a style called 'Fright Night' © MIT   NIGHTMARE MACHINE Scientists at MIT have developed a system that is trying to find the scariest image out there. Dubbed the 'Nightmare Machine' the algorithm created by the team is making photographs of famous landmarks appear scary. In another part of the spooky research, the AI system learns what makes images frightening using feedback from humans. Every time a vote is cast, the AI learns more about what humans consider a scary image.  The algorithm created by the team is making photographs of famous landmarks appear like something out of a horror film. 'We use state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to learn how haunted houses, or toxic cities look like,' the researchers said. 'Then, we apply the learnt style to famous landmarks and present you: AI-powered horror all over the world!' Interested viewers can help MIT find the essence of horror on the website, or look at more of the pictures the Nightmare Machine has generated on Instagram.    Artificial neural network is the technology that is responsible for the surreal images of Google’s DeepDream, which can ‘see’ objects and animals that are not really there.

The network typically consists of 10 to 30 stacked layers of artificial neurons and each image is fed into the input layer, which then talks to the next layer, until eventually the 'output' layer is reached. The network's 'answer' comes from this final output layer. In doing this, the software builds up a idea of what it thinks an object looked like.  In the 'generative adversarial network,' part of the network will attempt to fool the other part by inventing fake data, which will be mistaken for training data.  The Nightmare Machine team is making photographs of famous landmarks appear scary.

In creating a network that works against itself, researchers believe it will eventually learn to be more precise in its output.    'We use state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to learn how haunted houses, or toxic cities look like,' the researchers said. 'Then, we apply the learnt style to famous landmarks and present you: AI-powered horror all over the world!'

Each time someone votes for an image as scary, the algorithms learn to consider the qualities of that image as fear-inducing qualities - and the same goes for non-scary' images. Every time a vote is cast, the AI learns more about what humans consider a scary image. With enough input from people around the world, the AI could generate the sum of human fears. TURN YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS INTO DEEP DREAM NIGHTMARES  Last year, Google gave a glimpse into how its Deep Dream networks learns to recognise photos. The results were a terrifying and fascinating mix of random animals, eyes and psychedelic shapes spotted in everyday images. And a few weeks later, developers created an app that lets you transform your own photos and GIFs into Deep Dream nightmares. Called Deep Dreamer, the tool was built by Realmac Software based in Brighton and is only available for Mac users. The company specialises in Mac software and has not revealed plans to roll it our for Windows user.  Any photo or GIF can be dragged into the tool, or opened from the File menu, and a series of tools lets users tweak how the finished photo, or ‘dream’ will look. These range from an impressionist painting style, to looking for eyes, animals and a dream described simply as ‘trippy’. The number of ‘dreams’ and iterations can be tweaked to dig deeper into the image and Google’s code, resulting in more obscure and surreal images. Once the refinements have been selected, users click ‘Start dreaming’ and the image begins to change on the screen. A progress bar sits at the top and a notification is sent when the ‘dream has finished’. Last year, Google gave a glimpse into how its Deep Dream networks learns to recognise photos.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 14, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Is Google killing mobile organic search? Mobile SEO 25 Oct 16 | Andy Favell Facebook0 Linkedin116 Google+31 Twitter 147 Click-through rates for websites depend a great deal on their position in organic search results. But to what extent are local businesses further compromised as Google pushes all organic results further and further off the bottom of the mobile screen as it prioritizes paid ads, Google My Business listings, Knowledge Graph and/or Accelerated Mobile Pages? And when directories, aggregators, articles, reviews and chains dominate the top organic slots, what hope is there that the mobile user will scroll two, three, four or more screens to find the website of the local restaurant or hotel they seek? This is the first of two columns on the state of mobile search. This column is focused on what’s happening to mobile organic search – i.e. where websites come in the search engine result page (SERPS). The follow-up column will consider the Google-owned properties – particularly Google My Business and Knowledge Graph – that are displacing organic results, including the impact as Google commercializes these businesses. So burning question is: has Google killed mobile organic search? For these two columns ClickZ consulted five experts. Brian Halligan, CEO HubSpot Andrew Shotland, CEO LocalSEOGuide.com Will Critchlow CEO, Distilled David Mihm, local digital marketing consultant. Kevin Cotch, SEO Analyst at TopRank Marketing The answer (as you’d expect from inbound and local marketers and SEO specialists) is organic search is not dead, but there is no doubt that the game has changed immeasurably, and continues to change every time Google introduces a new innovation, including on-going changes to paid search, Google My Business listings, Knowledge Graph and its latest baby Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Andrew Shotland sums up the responses nicely: Google hasn’t killed organic search on mobile but it has certainly maimed it. There is still a large amount of traffic going to non-Google properties in local organic SERPs. Despite Google’s continuing takeover of prime SERP real estate with its own properties, its algorithms still need to allow for a wide breadth of results because it still has to account different intents from a single query. As shown in the Local Search Ranking Factors report (June 2016), Google treats “implicit” geo queries (searches like “pizza” that may have local intent but don’t specify a geography) differently than “explicit” geo queries (e.g. “pizza in Chicago”). And while Google is generally pretty smart about what the most popular intents are, when it’s fuzzy, they will need to provide a variety of results. So smart SEOs still have a lot to play with. So what has Google done to organic search? A. More paid search ads. B. Prioritized Google My Business (GMB). For a business-related Google mobile search, the priority for results is usually as follows – as demonstrated by results for “Restaurants in Mayfair”, below: Paid search ads (designated by a PL in the screenshots below) – up to four different ads for popular search queries in popular locations. These can be quite sizeable, including up to 10 lines of text or links. Google My Business (GMB) results – three local businesses (listed in Google’s directory) are shown on a local map, then given an individual listing of four lines each. The listings do not correspond with the organic results below. Organic results (OL) – approx. 10 listings. For popular search terms such as “restaurants in X” or “Pizza nearby” the top ranking results are often dominated by aggregators such as directories, delivery services (if restaurants), articles, reviews and national/international chains – this may mean (as in the case below) that there are no restaurants on the first page of search results at all. More ads – often including ads for download native apps. Related searches – approx. eight listings of searches recommended by Google. (Aside: a study of how these recommended searches relate to the keywords favored by advertisers would be a really interesting read). Option to see next page of results. C. Prioritized Knowledge Graph For a content-related Google mobile search, the priority for results is usually as follows – as demonstrated by results for “Mayfair”, below: Paid search ads (none present in the example). Knowledge graph (KG) – this is an expandable panel of information and images related to the search query, drawn from various sources e.g. Wikipedia and may include GMB-type listings (as shown below, these may be restaurants or hotels.) Organic results. Related searches. Option to see next page of results. D. Accelerated mobile pages (AMP) A further complication to organic search is AMP, which is a Google backed initiative to make mobile pages load faster. Currently these are mostly news stories (it has yet to gain much traction with business), and are usually displayed as a carousel of headlines and images. Depending on the search term AMP results will come first, second behind paid ads, third behind ads and GMB or KG results, and sometimes among the organic results. Whichever, the effect is that organic results can be pushed further below the fold. The following screenshots show two mobile searches conducted in London (results in different countries may bring different results). The fold line denotes where the visible screen ends (before scrolling) on large smartphones, such as Samsung Galaxy S6. The first is for “Restaurants in Mayfair” – which shows how organic listings are pushed two+ screens down search results by three ads and the three Google My Business restaurant listings (notated by GMB in the image). These GMB listings do not correspond with organic search results. Also note the absence of any restaurants at all in the first page of search results. The second search was for “Mayfair” – which shows how organic listings are pushed off the first page by Google’s Knowledge Graph (KG). Interestingly the restaurants in the KG are different to those in GMB results for “Restaurants in Mayfair”, if expanded (not shown) KG also shows a carousel of hotels, these results are different to the GMB results for hotels in Mayfair. Bizarrely, restaurants (RL) and hotels (HL) do better in organic results for “Mayfair” than “Restaurants in Mayfair” or “Hotels in Mayfair”. This may reflect the fact that the context is not what Shotland would call explicit.

In February 2016 Google shifted paid ads from the right side panel to above organic results. For content-related searches Google’s Knowledge Graph (KG) has taken the place of the ads in the panel. This means that in situations where there are fewer paid ads, organic search results may be above the fold on a PC screen. GMB would also fit well in the side panel, but instead it sits above the organic results, and below the ads, leaving the side panel blank. This means organic results are pushed down the page, and depending on the dimensions of the PC screen size, below the fold. The disparity of PC screen sizes makes it difficult to estimate where the fold would fall on the screenshots. Why is Google doing this? There are two motivations: First, Google want to make more (even more) money from advertising and partner referrals. Second, it wants to provide better answers to the searchers’ queries – this we assume is partly motivated by expectations for growth of voice search. If it can achieve this without searchers leaving Google’s properties all the better (for Google). HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan: I think there are two real changes that have happened with Google Search, since we started HubSpot 10 years ago: AdWords: 50% of above the fold v 100% above the fold…  10 years ago, for most searches you got a few ads along the top and bunch of ads along the side of the results page. For that same search today, there are no ads along the side and the ads along the top cover the entire space above the fold on a regular computer and above the fold on a mobile phone. This means that if you want to get found in Google, paid is far more important than it used to. Organic: Research the answer v Give you the answer….  When we started HubSpot 10 years ago, for most searches, you just got a list of 10 links on the first page and the name of the SEO game was getting to the first page and as high as possible. Increasingly, Google is just giving you the answer to the question. The percent of queries I do where the answer is provided is going way up and the quality of those answers is very good. Organic search isn’t dead, by any means. The long-tail game of getting many keywords on the front page of the SERP still works, but increasingly you’ll need to work to just be “the answer” to the query as opposed to one of the list of answers. How are Google’s changes impacting organic results?  Click-through rates (CTR) for organic search fall as the position increases All studies conclude that CTR declines the further down the SERPS the results is, but there is disagreement over the numbers and how this varies by the type of site and the search query. The following table shows the results of a study by Authoritas (formally Analytics SEO) in 2015, which illustrates how rapidly the chance of traffic declines with each search position. Note the differences between desktop and mobile CTR per position and between search terms that relate to the brand and search terms that do not. But what is the impact of paid ads, Google My Business and Knowledge Graph on organic CTR? Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any research on the impact of Google move to monopolize the prime search real estate with its owned properties. However a survey by ComScore and Localeze reveals that: 72% of respondents perceived local search results most relevant, compared with 23% for organic results and a meager 5% for paid search results. 67% – slightly fewer – perceived local results the most trustworthy, ahead of 26% for organic and 7% for paid. If this sense of relevancy and trust influences click-through rates, as you would expect, then it is inevitable that Google prioritizing GMB results will impact organic search results. The big question is: to what extent would that trust in local results be undermined if/when Google starts to introduce paid local listings? The impact of Google commercializing GMB and KG, we will consider in the next column. Anecdotally, it appears that some sites have been hit harder than others by Google’s changes. Andrew Shotland: The damage has been real. We have seen local organic traffic, particularly on mobile, for large sites trending downwards over the past two years. The big event was Google anchoring the Google My Business three-pack at the top of most local SERPs on both mobile and desktop from late 2015. We’ve definitely seen GMB cannibalize organic traffic to a far greater degree than paid ads. When searching a local business name on a phone, there is now enough information on many of the Google My Business panels to reduce the need for a user to scroll to the organic results. This is great for local businesses that have a well-optimized GMB page. Not so great for everyone else trying to show you info about that business. For other sites we still see growing organic search traffic and businesses are still getting a lot of conversions from organic mobile listings – particularly those who value phone calls. Even for those sites that have been losing overall organic traffic Google still knows to send you highly relevant traffic – the traffic that converts well – so sometimes conversions go up even as traffic goes down. We’re in it for the long tail. While Google attempts to condition and steer searchers with recommended search queries – both as the term is typed and through related searches at the end of the results page (assuming anyone makes it that far) – and attempts to distract with paid ads, GMB and KG listings, Google will always try to deliver the best results for the query. The more precise, relevant and frequent the terms used by the mobile user visa vie your sites keywords, the more likely the mobile searcher will be to find a listing for your site and the less clutter they will find in the way. Will Critchlow, CEO, Distilled: However much Google tries to give one-box instant answers, and no matter how much they monetize commercial phrases, so far, total mobile search volume is growing strongly enough that total organic mobile is growing as a channel. It’s really easy to forget the huge volume in the long-tail of search. In the long tail advertising is much sparser, one-box answers are less compelling, and the aggregators have much thinner content. It’s even easier to forget this as keyword data recedes into the rear-view mirror in the form of (not provided). Thus, in terms of tactics, we recommend moving further up the funnel, and capturing searchers earlier in the lifecycle, as well as beating out the aggregators based on your business’ strengths and USPs – of course you will likely want to complement that with conversion-oriented paid search and appearing on appropriate aggregator / powerful sites as well. SEO on its own may not be sufficient. While SEO remains very relevant for mobile search, it should be used (as Critchlow also suggests above) as part of a coordinated marketing plan. Kevin Cotch, SEO analyst at TopRank Marketing: I do not believe that Google has killed organic search for mobile users. Google still shows the information that is the most relevant for the mobile audience including organic listings, but the SERP on a mobile phone is more limited. Google is typically showing more owned results (i.e. paid, local listings, featured snippets, etc.) with the limited space on mobile SERPs.   I recommend approaching mobile with a unique strategy that targets where your audience is within the marketing funnel. Marketers should implement an integrated mobile strategy to attract, engage, and convert your target audience by incorporating SEO, paid, email, and social campaigns. Part of the mobile strategy related to SEO would utilize development resources to implement AMP, schema markup, and optimizing your website for site speed to enhance user experience.  At the end of the day, Google will continue to change the SERPs to provide the best results. Search marketers will need to continue optimizing their integrated mobile strategy to get the most out of each campaign, including SEO. The follow-up column to this one will consider the Google-owned and controlled properties – particularly Google My Business and Knowledge Graph – that are displacing organic results.

Web Bloat Score Calculator Compare size of a page to a compressed image of the same page URL PAGE SIZE IMAGE SIZE WEB-BS EXAMPLES Tim Berners-Lee This page web bloat - Google Search Amazon What is this? Page web bloat score (WebBS for short) is calculated as follows: WebBS = TotalPageSize / PageImageSize TotalPageSize is the size of all requests, and PageImageSize is the size of a full-page screenshot. The larger the WebBS, the more bloated a web page is relative to its image representation. For example, Tim Berners-Lee's homepage has a WebBS of 0.204, which makes it really efficient, while Amazon has score of ~20, making it bloated. Why? In order to fix something, we need to measure it first. Web bloat is a hot topic now: see posts by Maciej, Ronan, and Tammy. However, most of us still use a subjective absolute measurement: if it loads fast on your computer, then it's good. That "measure" is flawed: a web page with only two paragraphs that weighs 500 kB is going to load fast—but it's still bloated! So, how to measure web bloat? HTML is a text-based protocol, designed to render a graphics document on the client. The idea was that text is smaller to transfer than the full resolution image of a document. If that weren't so, Tim Berners-Lee would have designed a protocol to transfer images, not text and markup. That gives a convenient way to measure the bloat of any static web page—just compare it to a full-page screenshot of the same page. An example Take the "web bloat" Google search results page (SERP). Measuring absolutely, it weighs 416 kB and loads in 1.11 seconds. That's fast. However, a WebBS of 6.94 shows that it is bloated relative to its information content. Not a huge surprise, as in 1998 the Google homepage was only 10 kB. And the content is pretty much the same: ten links. Sure, today it has voice search and auto-suggest, but most people just click on the first few links. My web page has a WebBS>1, what do I do? Convert your page to an image map. For example, Google SERP as an clickable image map is only 106.7 kB (and two requests). Just kidding! But a surprising number of pages would be faster if Tim had created a pixel transfer protocol. A high WebBS usually indicates unused stuff on the page: JavaScript, CSS, oversized images, etc. Maybe you have a valid reason for that content. But more often than not, it means you can optimize it more. But wait: your sponsor's page is also bloated?! Ooops. Yes, the WebBS of TestDome.com is 7.11. It used to be much worse, and that's how all this started. As a TestDome co-founder, a few months ago I noticed that the homepage had become slightly slower. I opened the source HTML and found that nine customer reference logos were embedded in full resolution, like this 150 kB monster. I asked a developer to fix it, and he did a great job converting logos to css sprites. But he told me he would leave 13 other requests for web chat unchanged, because they are async and provided by a third party. The same with five requests for Google analytics. The designer wanted to leave a custom web font and jQuery gets cached anyway. In the end, we're a startup, and there are more urgent tasks than hand-coding our homepage. We left it as it is, and I realised that popular web stacks make it hard to develop non-bloated pages. How do you generate screenshots, and why PNG? Requests go to an Azure VPS machine running SlimerJS, a scriptable browser. That is similar technology to what we use for web programming tests. The current calculator can process ~5 screenshots per minute; after that limit is reached, a page with instructions on how to calculate WebBS manually is displayed. It was our arbitrary decision to use PNG, as they are lossless compression. Maybe JPEGs would be better, most web pages have lossy JPEGs on them anyway. To measure the web bloat of a dynamic page (video or animation), compare it with compressed video of the same page. But this calculator doesn't do that. How can the image of a page be smaller than the page itself? Because web pages have been growing exponentially: As of September 2016, the average web page is 2496 kB in size and requires 140 requests. To understand why, we need a bit of history... The long tale of two tribes Since the first computers were connected, there was a fight. Between the "thin" tribe and the "fat" tribe. The thin tribe wanted to render everything on the source server and make the destination server a "dumb" terminal. Quick, simple, and zero dependency. But the fat tribe said no, it's stupid to transfer every graphics element. Let's make a fat "smart" client that executes rendering (or part of the business logic) on the destination server. Then you don't need to transfer every graphics element, just the minimum data. The fat tribe always advertised three benefits of fat, smart clients: smaller bandwidth, less latency, and that the client can render arbitrary stuff. But, in the early days of computing, "graphics" was just plain text. Data was pretty much the same as its graphic representation, and people could live with a short latency after they pressed enter at a command line. The thin tribe won and the text terminal conquered the world. The peak of this era was the IBM mainframe, a server that can simultaneously serve thousands of clients thanks to its I/O processors. The fat tribe retreated, shaking its collective fist, saying, "Just you wait—one day graphics will come, and we'll be back!" They waited until the 80s. Graphics terminals become popular, but they were sluggish. Sending every line, color, or icon over the wire sucked up the bandwidth. When dragging and rearranging elements with the mouse, you could see the latency. Unlike simple text flow, graphics brought myriad screen resolutions, color depths, and DPI. "We told you so!" said the fat tribe, and started creating smart client-server solutions. Client-servers and PCs were all the rage in the 80s. But even bigger things were on the horizon. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee was thinking about how to create world wide web of information. He decided not to join a tribe but to go the middle route. His invention, HTML, would transfer only the semantic information, not the representation. You could override how fonts or colors looked in your client, to the joy of fat tribe. But for all relevant computing you would do a round trip to the server, to the delight of the thin tribe. Scrolling, resizing, and text selection were instantaneous: there was only a wait when you decided to go to the next page. Tim's invention took the world by the storm. It was exactly the "graphics terminal" that nobody wished for but everybody needed. It was open and people started creating clients and adding more features. The first candy was inline images. They required more bandwidth, but the designers promised to be careful and always embed the optimized thumbnail in the page. They also didn't like the free floating text, so they started using tables to make fixed layouts. Programmers wanted to add code on the client for validation, animation, or just for reducing round trips. First they got Java applets, then JavaScript, then Flash. Publishers wanted audio and video, and then they wanted ads. Soon the web became a true fat client, and everybody liked it. The thin tribe was acting like a crybaby: "You can't have so many dependencies—the latest Java, latest Flash, latest Real media encoder, different styles for different browsers, it's insane!" They went on to develop Remote desktop, Citrix XenDesktop, VNC, and other uncool technologies used by guys in grey suits. But they knew that adding crap to the client couldn't last forever. And there is a fundamental problem with HTML… HTML was designed for academics, not the average Joe Look at the homepages of Tim Berners-Lee, Bjarne Stroustrup, and Donald Knuth. All three together have 235 kB, less than one Google SERP. Images are optimized, most of the content is above the fold, and their pages were "responsive" two decades before responsive design became a thing. But they are all ugly. If the father of the WWW, the father of C++, and the father of computer algorithms were in an evening web development class, they would all get an F and be asked to do their homepages again. The average Joe prefers form over content and is too lazy to write optimized code. To be honest, I would be an average Joe if I were a web developer. Implementing customer features brings more money and fame than optimizing CSS sprites. This leads me to a conclusion: You can't blame web developers for making a completely rational decision. If a 2496 kB page weight is the average, not an exception, then it is a failure of the technology, not all the people who are using it. At one point, Google realized there was an issue with the web. Their solution: SPDY (now part of HTTP/2) and Brotli. The idea is that, although the web is bloated, we will create the technology to fix the bloat on the fly. Brotli is particularly interesting, as it uses a predefined 120 kB dictionary containing the most common words in English, Chinese, Arabic, as well as common phrases in HTML and JavaScript! But, there is only so much that lipstick can do for a pig. Even the best web compressor can't figure out whether all that JS and CS is actually going to be used, or replace images with thumbnails or improve the JPEG compression ratio because the user would never notice the difference. Lossless compression of some 255 kB JS library doesn't help much. The thin tribe realized that with a good compressor and good bandwidth the game changes. OnLive Game Service was launched in 2010, allowing you to stream games from the cloud. The next year, Gaikai launched their service for cloud gaming. They were not competitors for long: Sony purchased Gaikai in 2012, and all OnLive patents in 2015. They used the technology to create PlayStation Now. Today I can play more than 400 live games on Samsung Smart TV, at 30 frames per second. But I still need to wait 8.3 second to fully load the CNN homepage. Who is crazy here? Remember main arguments of the fat tribe: smaller bandwidth, less latency, and that the client can render arbitrary stuff. Seems that with websites of 2016, thin tribe can do all of that equally good or better. In my modest opinion, the web is in the state of bloat because the fat tribe screwed it up. Today's technology makes it too easy to create bloated websites and too hard make slim ones. About Zel is the author of this text, parts of which are copied from his earlier "PXT Protocol" article. But that article is a piece of crap, as even smart readers of reddit didn't figure out it was a sarcastic piece.

The new version brings out a few enhancements such as integration with popular food delivery services, support for plus codes—identifiers for locations that don’t have their own street address—and other perks. These new features require Google Maps 4.24 for iOS or later, which can be downloaded free of charge from the App Store. Food delivery integration lets you order food from your favorite restaurant. Just search for a restaurant in Google Maps and you’ll see a new “Place an order” option above its phone number and below the menu, provided the place works with GrubHub, Seamless, EatStreet, Eat 24 or one of the other major online delivery services. Tapping the link takes you to the delivery service’s website or app, if installed, to complete your order. Ordering from food delivery services is not available in all countries, with availability varying from city to city. Next, you can now find plus codes by dropping a pin anywhere in the world. Plus codes, as per Google, let you explore places that lack an easy number-and-street identifier. To share a location without a specific street address, drop a pin anywhere, swipe up the location card and tap the code to copy it to the system clipboard, then share the URL with friends and family. You can find the plus code for your location at http://plus.codes. In addition to the aforesaid new features, the refreshed app comes with bug fixes and provides a more streamlined way of taking and adding photos of places: to take a new image or upload an existing image from your Photos library, tap an “Add a photo” option below the existing shots.

The Unesco Dolomites on Google Street View The first Italian organisation to sign up to the Google Trekker Loan Program: now it is possible to enjoy the Dolomites online Tags thatsveneto dolomites unesco google street view 25 ottobre 2016 The UNESCO Dolomites Foundation is the first Italian organisation to sign up to the Google Trekker Loan Program, so from today it will be possible to enjoy the Dolomites online The UNESCO Dolomites Foundation is the first Italian organisation to sign up to the Google Trekker Loan Program, so from today it will be possible to enjoy the Dolomites online , whether you’re in New York, Calcutta or anywhere else, using Google Maps Street View. The project to map some of the most popular footpaths in the systems that make up the Dolomites UNESCO World Heritage Site was launched at the end of summer 2014. The test phase was run between September and October during which the mapping team travelled along some twenty footpaths in seven of the nine systems: the Dal Piaz refuge on the Vette Feltrine peaks, the Mondeval plateau from the Giau pass, Prato Piazza from Braies, the Armentara meadows and the Tosa Pedrotti refuge on the Brenta Dolomites. People travelled along the footpaths with a Google Trekker backpack, lugging 25 kilos of equipment in a metal framework studded with an aerial and 15 cameras shooting thousands of stunning views at a startling rate of eight every ten seconds. Credits: Unesco Dolomites Foundation This sequence of geo-referenced pictures then makes up the online route allowing anyone, anywhere from Buenos Aires to Palermo, to take a virtual stroll in the Dolomites. As Marcella Morandini, General Secretary of the UNESCO Dolomites Foundation emphasises: “This is a great communications and promotional tool and while of course it can’t replace a carefully planned hiking route, it’s an innovative way of promoting the UNESCO World Heritage Site the world over”. The second phase of the project kicks off in summer 2015 when the mapping continues with the involvement of other local organisations. The aim is to cover footpaths in all nine of the systems of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, in particular the scenic circular paths and the high altitude trails known as the Alte Vie. “From time to time we need to review our choice of trails in partnership with local experts” explains Giuliano Vantaggi project leader for the UNESCO Dolomites Foundation. “We are fully aware of the importance of safety and naturally it would be unthinkable to try to cover the most exposed and complex trails with such heavy equipment on the back. At this stage of the operation we intend to choose the least demanding hiking trails with the highest visual impact, to show the Dolomites off to the world in their full glory”. All you need to do is to link to Google Street View , and place the little man icon on the footpaths shown in blue to relive a trip you have made, get a foretaste of your holiday or just fall head-over-heels in love with the Dolomites.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday November 15, 2016 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Google's Pixel is a challenge to other Android phone-makers, not Apple Tim Biggs 6 Oct 2016, 2:17 p.m. In a move not unlike Microsoft's when it first introduced the Surface, Google is trying to show vendors how it's done. This week we got our first (official) look at Google's new Pixel smartphones, and predictably much of the discussion has been around how they stack up to or "challenge" Apple's iPhones, and whether they're really Google's "first ever" phones or just Nexus devices by another name. While the Pixel has some obvious physical similarities to the iPhone, and while there were some playful jokes at Apple's expense during Google's presentation (free online storage, headphone jack etc), it's not necessarily accurate to say the big G is "taking the fight" to Apple by attempting to make an iPhone of its own. The devices are similar in that their hardware and software are created by one company, but if anything Google is trying to make the anti-iPhone. In a year when Apple has released a phone very similar to last year's phone (which was itself a minor upgrade to the phone we saw the year before that), Google wants to push the idea that it's releasing something new. The very appeal of an iPhone is its ubiquity and familiarity, with new software arriving across the entire platform at once and new hardware adding faster or better versions of what came before. Meanwhile the Pixel is stepping out from the rest of the Android ecosystem to act as a proving ground for all sorts of Google stuff that isn't found elsewhere (yet), like Daydream VR, Google Assistant and live screen-sharing customer support, as well and recent Google apps like Allo and Duo, which are built in. Even the name, Pixel, promotes this newness, being the only flagship phone name I can think of without a number or other model indicator at the end of it. No, I don't think Apple has to feel too worried or challenged by the Pixel. They are very different devices for consumers that want very different things. Existing makers of Android smartphones, however, could have reason to start sweating. Previously, the only phones to get the big Google stamp of approval have been Nexus branded. These were solid, accessible devices that set a baseline for the Android experience. Clean, competent and always up-to-date, Nexus phones carried the names of their manufacturers (like HTC, Huawei or LG), but ran a version of Android untouched by phone-makers or telcos. With Pixel, not only has Google aimed significantly higher with its hardware spec, but it's offering an "opinionated" twist on its own Android software. Pixel runs Android 7.1, but it isn't the 7.1 that Samsung, Sony and others are working to integrate into their devices. In addition to the blue light filter, Dream VR mode and various tweaks in the vanilla version of 7.1, Pixel packs customisations including Google Assistant integration throughout, a new launcher that works like an evolution of Google Now, the unlimited and automatic ability to back up and restore videos and pictures in full resolution, built-in chat support and a smart storage solution that backs up old files to the cloud to save space. The look and feel of the software is also custom and unique to Pixel. By designing its own hardware and putting its own unique twist on vanilla Android, Google is placing its own device in direct competition to other Android flagships. And although some of the features will likely become available to others (Google Assistant seems like a no-brainer), the Pixel could offer a nice alternative for those tired of waiting for their telco or handset maker to integrate Google's latest and greatest. The story Google's Pixel is a challenge to other Android phone-makers, not Apple first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

The problem has been officially acknowledged by Google, with several popular Android Wear smartwatches affected by connectivity issues, including the Moto 360, Asus ZenWatch, Tag Heuer Connected and a variety of other devices. While iOS 10.0.2 solved the issue when it comes to some Android Wear devices, other wearables running Google’s operating system still suffered from connectivity problems. With the release of iOS 10.1 on Monday, however, Apple and Google have managed to solve all pairing issues related to Android Wear smartwatches. Google says it worked with Apple to resolve the problem. iOS 10.1 also introduced a redesigned iMessage Apps Drawer and the iPhone 7 Plus’ Portrait Mode. If Google’s product forums are any indication, the iPhone 7 and Android Wear seem to be fully compatible across all devices now. Related: Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus bokeh ‘Portrait Mode’ is now available with iOS 10.1 SourceGoogle It’s Me Why would Apple help “fix” it? Didn’t they break it on purpose? Derrick Rockwell I don’t think that is the case. Android wear worked flawlessly with previous model iPhones running iOS 10. My guess is that it had something to do with the W1 chip that Apple introduced in the iPhone 7/Plus models for easy pairing of headphones (first model being apples new air pods). Patrick O’Rourke Yup, exactly. It’s great to see the companies working together to solve this problem. JD Too bad my Moto360 Gen2 is in a bunch of piece following a repair trip to Futuretel.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple’s created mockups of iMessage for Android, including one with pure Material Design By Christian Zibreg, Oct 25, 2016 Tweet 33 Comments I was just reading a post titled “On iMessage’s Stickiness” from Apple pundit John Gruber, published last evening on his Daring Fireball blog, and stumbled upon an interesting passage alleging that Apple’s created several mockups of iMessage for Android. One of the mockups of iMessage for Android reportedly looks like a carbon copy of its iOS counterpart, with another one based on Google’s Material Design guidelines. “I’ve heard from little birdies that mockups of iMessage for Android have circulated within the company, with varying UI styles ranging from looking like the iOS Messages app to pure Material Design,” reads the post. MacDailyNews started the iMessage for Android rumor earlier this year. The report claimed Apple would announce an Android edition of the iMessage service at WWDC 2016. WWDC came and went without any mention of iMessage for Android. The new report from Gruber suggests that Apple has at least explored the idea before ultimately choosing to abandon or delay iMessage for Android. Naysayers could say that Steve Jobs promised to turn FaceTime into an open standard that would be supported by carriers and device makers, which never came to be. “I don’t think we’re ever actually going to see FaceTime as an open standard,” wrote Gruber. “But I think the sentiment that drove Jobs to want it to be an open standard applies to the idea of releasing iMessage for Android. Apple doesn’t need to rely on platform-exclusive lock-in.” Apple Music for Android has a Material Design feel to it so I’m not surprised that Apple was considering giving iMessage for Android the same look and feel as many other Android apps built around Material Design. What’s your opinion on iMessage for Android? Would Apple be better off releasing iMessage for Android or should the service remain exclusive to iOS device as a crucial part of iMessage’s stickiness?

AMB_07 Why? Gabriel Anaya It’s major strength is that it’s iOS exclusive. My favorite feature about iPhones and iPads is iMessage. It’s not like Apple Music either, where they make a profit off of it. It just offers more incentive to go to the iOS ecosystem AMB_07 But as a consumer what you’re describing is not strengh it’s limitations. It’s only “strength” for Apple not for you and even in this case Apple doesn’t seem to fully agree since they’re considering the idea of porting it over. Nuff Said No one from Apple ever stated they were considering the idea. AMB_07 According to many sources they have. Granted they never officially said anything so you can take it with a grain of salt. Jayy Me too MMA Rules Me too Patrick Kormann Bring it on! It’s annoying to use several different messaging apps only because you know people that don’t have iPhones ^^ Jamessmooth https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4881db87f3d40496b5a2221c373c248fbebd385ed6490d9253e94047bdff9fcf.jpg Innes I’d also like to see it on Desktop PCs. I use the Message app on my work iMac but would also like to use it on my PC at home too. OWashe Eats not get ahead of ourselves Mr_Coldharbour iMessage uses a very particular encryption protocol and knowing that Windows PCs are riddled with security holes and overal security architecture is just very different it wouldn’t make sense to “port it over.” Porting it to PC will basically mean it will be a less safe version than its iOS and OS X counterpart. Budz Camacho One of the reason I Use iPhone because of this exclusive feature. I say iMessage should stay exclusive for all apple products MMA Rules Agree,  worked so hard to have this and now give it away Stephen Hedger I have iPhone 6 and Galaxy s7 and when I’m using s7 I miss iMessage as that’s what most of my friends use. If it came to android I would miss my iPhone even less and that can’t be good for Apple if one of the reasons they buy an iPhone is for iMessage to chat to mates etc. It would be great though. Nice to not need to swap between different sms apps to chat to different people etc MMA Rules One of my coworkers have a Galaxy and I was sending him a message with a picture and he was standing right next to me but some part of my workplace don’t have signal and I told him if you had iMessage this would have never happened Stephen Hedger If you mean your work place has wifi then surely he could just use whatsapp? MMA Rules Yes we have wifi and no he didn’t have WhatsApp installed and it was a picture that he needed right away because it was work related but you get my point iMessage is a stock application that we don’t think about installing it it’s just there Stephen Hedger Yeah I get you. Everyone I know has iPhones and imessage is just THE messaging standard. Would be cool if it was ported to android. Would make whatsapp obsolete I think. Greensprout It’s already too late, I use iMessage 99% of the time as do most people I know. Alex Wilson If Apple want to remain competitive and relevant they need to export some of their features into cross platform situations. Apps like WhatsApp are going to cut in on them. If you want to compete with Facebook and others, you need to expand your horizons. Providing an Android and Windows app would be a good move to keep people in the Apple family. Our family has 3 iPhone users and one Droid, I hate Facebook, but that’s where my two kids prefer to message me from. MMA Rules The only difference is that when you live for example in the United States people don’t know about WhatsApp and the iMessage is standard on the phone so for example me I use both but I use WhatsApp mainly when talking to people outside the states then with people in the states I unconsciously use iMessage, if you know what I mean! Y2J: Keeper of the List Exactly. I have never heard any single person I know say anything about WhatsApp ever. It’s just not popular here. Kik and stuff is but that’s never gonna take over it’s mostly little horndogs in middle/high school that use it. I do think iMessage for Android and possibly windows could be very good though john snow YES!! They should popularise iMessage. Y2J: Keeper of the List I think it’d be cool and nice and all, but it should stay exclusive to Apple. It’s a lot different than having Apple Music on Android for example Richard Aronson I would love for them push iMessages to Android. If they don’t do it soon I won’t be using iMessages much longer. Instead I’ll use WhatsApp for 90% of my messaging and iMessages and Google text app for SMS messages. Charles222 OhpleaseOhplease. I bounce between ecosystems all the time and having something as great as iMessage on Android would be the bomb. Tom García Same here. It would totally destroy WhatsApp. James G Make it universal like email. No need to keep it exclusive. That only limits who you can communicate with. SMS via iCloud was a start but they need to go all in. mwpitt52 If Apple does port iMessage to Android they should make the Android version a different color bubble so iPhone users can discriminate against the Droids. Nathan Duarte Most of my friends have iPhones so even if I want to switch, I can’t because of iMessage and FaceTime… Releasing those on Android would release me, and many others, which is why I think Apple won’t do it… Mr_Coldharbour It must stay exclusive and proprietary to iOS and OS X (yes I said OS X because that’s name I’m accustomed to).   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines KGI (again) predicts iPhone demand has peaked for the year due to lackluster improvements Apple spent years testing if touchscreens made sense on the Mac New Apple ad highlights Beats Solo3 Wireless 40-hour battery & on-ear controls Some Chinese users are giving their old iPhones a makeover to look like iPhone 7 Microsoft is bringing integrated developer environment Visual Studio to the Mac   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

As of today, Google Express is launching in portions of Alabama, Kentucky, Utah, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. With these added regions, Google Express will now reach 70 million more people, the company says. Combined with the markets where the service was already live, Google Express today covers around 90 percent of the United States. The service aims to challenge Amazon, and in particular Amazon Prime Now, the online retailer’s same-day delivery service that’s live in major cities around the U.S. for Amazon Prime customers. What makes Google Express different is its retailer lineup. In most cases, it’s partnering with national retailers who either haven’t yet figured out e-commerce, or only offer delivery through more traditional means – not one-day delivery. While the retailers will vary by region, some of the brands working with Google include Costco, Whole Foods, Kohl’s, PetSmart, Sur La Table, Fry’s, Road Runner Sports, Walgreens, L’Occitane, Payless ShoeSource, and Guitar Center. One exception to that list, in terms of same-day delivery, would be Whole Foods – the store currently offers delivery through Instacart’s online grocery shopping service. But Google Express ditched its plans to delve into grocery delivery as part of a shift in strategy earlier this year. By distancing itself from the more costly handling of fresh and frozen goods, the company is able to take its service nationwide. The other key difference between Google Express and Prime Now is the pricing. While Amazon makes same-day delivery a perk for its Amazon Prime members, that requires customers to subscribe to Amazon’s $99 per year membership program. Google instead lets shoppers choose between buying a $95 annual membership, or paying a delivery charge of $5 (or more, at times.) Google Express shoppers also have to abide by store minimums, which are typically around $15 but can be as high as $35. Customers can place an order in Google Express, then choose their delivery window. Most orders can be delivered in one day, though not necessarily same day. Others will be delivered in two days, which means Google Express will also rival Amazon Prime. This, too, will vary by region. Google’s interest in entering online retail may seem curious, but it’s tied to the fact that Amazon has become the top destination for shopping searches. A recent survey found that more than half (55%) of U.S. online shoppers now begin product searches directly on Amazon, while search engines like Google and Yahoo saw declines. Only 28 percent are now starting shopping searches on Google, down from 34 percent the year prior. By year-end, Google says it plans to have the entire continental U.S. covered by Google Express. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Express Description Google Express: same-day delivery from your favorite local stores.

This means the hugely popular messaging app, which has over a billion users, can compete with the likes of Apple's FaceTime, Microsoft's Skype and Google's recently-released Duo app . Unfortunately the update is only drip-feeding through at the moment, so not everyone will be able to access it. And it looks like it's only available for Android phones at the moment - meaning iPhone users will have to rely on FaceTime. Read More WhatsApp makes big change to messaging – and people are furious Google Duo is Google's version of a video calling app First spotted by Android Police , the update seems to be randomly available for some and not for others. We couldn't find it ourselves but others are reporting it is working if you have installed the version 2.16.318. Just as with a voice call, you can launch a video call by selecting your WhatsApp contact and tap the call button. The only difference being you'll now be able to select video. And if your contact doesn't have the latest version, you'll be told they need to update. Even though this is seemingly being trialled on Android phones, it likely won't be long before WhatsApp launches an iOS version. Read More How to have 'secret' conversations on Facebook Messenger Getty No everyone has access to the new WhatsApp update There's also no telling when it'll become a part of the full-scale app. Rumours have been circulating about WhatsApp voice calls since early summer. Voice calls will rely on a data or wi-fi connection the same as a voice call, so make sure you're not near your data limit before you start broadcasting yourself to your contacts. This is the latest in a series of new features from Facebook-owned WhatsApp. Recently it has added the ability to tag users in group chats and add stickers to messages just like Snapchat . It also decided to share all of your user data with Facebook, in a move that got some people a little bit angry .

Photo by Derek Martin 11:11 Monday 17 October 2016 0 Have your say On October the 4th, Google held a big hardware event. There were quite a few important announcements, including Google Home (a speaker that responds to voice commands), Google WiFi (a WiFi system for your home), Google Chromecast Ultra, Daydream and VR headsets and last, but by no means least, the new Google Pixel (5” screen) and Pixel XL (5.5” screen) smartphones. Phew! Such a lot of stuff that I could talk about. Let’s start with those phones. Google have of course been heavily invested in the mobile phone market for quite some time. They own Android, which accounts for roughly 86 per cent of the global market, but traditionally they haven’t made any hardware themselves. Even their Nexus range of devices were built in partnership with different manufacturers. That is all changing with the new Pixel range of phones. Apple have long claimed they can get more from the iPhone, because the hardware and software are designed to work together. Now Google can claim the same thing too and at first glance, it shows. The new phones are top spec devices aimed to compete with Apple’s and Samsung’s flagship phones. Here is a brief overview of the new phones. They have the best camera of any smartphone ever, according to independent analysis by DXOMark that scored the new camera at 89% https://www.dxomark.com/Mobiles/Pixel-smartphone-camera-review-At-the-top The phones are able to charge very fast, gaining 7 hours of usage out of just 15 minutes of charging. They come with 4 GBs of RAM, a whizzy fast processor and up to 128 GBs of storage, which will help if you want to shoot 4K video. Oh and Google Photos gives you unlimited storage for all of your photos and videos. Oh and they have a 3.5mm audio jack. Ahem. A running theme throughout the event on the 4th was AI (Artificial Intelligence). Google Assistant, which previewed in the new app Allo, is baked into the new phones and Google Home. It is possible to have entire conversations with Google Assistant and after watching the demonstrations (for both the phones and Google Home) it is hard not to be impressed. Imagine having a text chat with someone, who suggests you go to the cinema. Not only will Google Assistant be able to find you the times and dates of the film, but it will also be able to book tickets for the film and the restaurant nearby that you mentioned. In the case of Google Home, there was a really good demonstration where the speaker asked it to find a song by an artist that appeared in a film. Google Assistant found the correct song and played it. The speaker had the choice of listening to it normally, or casting the video on YouTube via Chromecast. No button pressing involved. While Google may have advertised the event as a hardware event, a very large part of it was dedicated to AI. The technology battleground of the future will not determined by hardware, but by AI.

Global smartwatch shipments plunged 51.6% in the third quarter, after Apple's updated Watch went on sale too close to the of September to have an impact on volumes, and after Google pushed back the launch of Android Wear 2.0. Figures published by IDC this week put shipments at 2.7 million units, compared to 5.6 million shipped in the third quarter of 2015. "The sharp decline in smartwatch shipment volumes reflects the way platforms and vendors are realigning," explained Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's wearables team, in a statement on Monday. "Apple revealed a new look and feel to watchOS that did not arrive until the launch of the second generation Watch at the end of September. Google's decision to hold back Android Wear 2.0 has repercussions for its OEM partners as to whether to launch devices before or after the holidays. Samsung's Gear S3, announced at IFA in September, has yet to be released," he said. "Collectively, this left vendors relying on older, ageing devices to satisfy customers." Market leader Apple saw volumes fall 71.6% to 1.1 million, while navigation specialist Garmin overtook Samsung to claim second place with 600,000 shipments, up from 100,000 a year earlier. By comparison, Samsung saw shipments climb 9% to 400,000. Lenovo and Pebble complete the top five, each shipping 100,000 smartwatches during the quarter, down from 300,000 and 200,000 respectively a year earlier. "It has also become evident that at present smartwatches are not for everyone," suggested Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. "Having a clear purpose and use case is paramount, hence many vendors are focusing on fitness due to its simplicity. However, moving forward, differentiating the experience of a smartwatch from the smartphone will be key," he said.

SUBSCRIBE Penguin 4.0: Necessary and positive improvement Are you excited about the recent Penguin update? You should be! Columnist Andrew Dennis explains why this algorithm adjustment is a boon to webmasters and SEOs. Andrew Dennis on October 25, 2016 at 9:32 am More Penguin 4.0 was announced on September 23, and I couldn’t be more excited. I believe Penguin 4 will be a boon for (legitimate) SEO companies everywhere. We had to wait over 700 days for the newest iteration of Penguin; it was a long time coming, but now that it’s here, it’s more than I hoped. There a few reasons I welcome this new Penguin with open arms: The algorithm now devalues links rather than punishing sites. Penguin is baked into Google’s core algorithm, updating in real time. The feasibility of negative SEO is greatly diminished. The new Penguin is more granular. Penguin 4.0 pushes SEO closer to real marketing. Penguin 4.0 is the relief many sites have waited over two years for. As an SEO, I’ve never anticipated an algorithm update as much. Note: Non-graph embedded tweets are paraphrased quotes from a conversation between Google Webmaster Trends Analyst Gary Illyes and Eric Enge of Stone Temple Consulting at Pubcon 2016 in Las Vegas. The algorithm now devalues links rather than punishing sites This new version of Penguin devalues spam links rather than penalizing entire sites. Gary Illyes expanded on this new Penguin fact in a Facebook conversation with Barry Schwartz, which he covered here on Search Engine Land. Illyes stated: This is a key distinction, and one that I am very happy about. When Penguin first launched, it was punitive by nature. If your site was affected by Penguin, your entire site was demoted in search — without clear explanation or instruction as to how to recover. The harshness of Penguin, combined with the misinformation surrounding the algorithm, created a negative environment and contentious relationships between business owners and Google. Penguin 4.0 — and its devalue vs. demotion approach — is a vast upgrade, and it should improve relations between site owners and Google. Google will still be able to prevent spam from manipulating their results, but now site owners won’t have to live in fear of a crippling Google penalty, with questionable recovery. Manual actions still exist, but these are made by discerning humans who are much better at determining the intent behind links. Manual penalties are also much easier to identify, both in application and in recovery. I’m optimistic this shift in Penguin will open the web for people to link more freely and openly. In fact, Penguin 4.0 should improve links as a ranking signal. Penguin is baked into Google’s core algorithm, updating in real time Penguin 4.0 is now baked into Google’s core algorithm, and updates in real time. With this change, Penguin’s data is refreshed in real time, so changes will be visible much faster, typically taking effect shortly after we recrawl and reindex a page. With the move to Penguin 4.0, Google will be able to assess links much more quickly. Penguin 4.0: real-time means as Google discovers links during crawl, can make decision then whether worth counting. #pubcon @stonetemple — Overit (@overit) October 12, 2016 This means no more waiting for Penguin refreshes or updates in order to recover. (Sites demoted by Penguin waited over 700 days for this latest update!) In fact, Google stated in their announcement that they won’t comment on any future refreshes. This is great news, and it should relieve more of the fear, misinformation and uncertainty surrounding Penguin. I can’t imagine how difficult it was for site owners to keep a website alive while demoted by Penguin for over a year and a half. Now that Penguin 4.0 is real time, site owners are no longer at the mercy of Google’s Penguin refreshes, which happened infrequently at best. This is particularly beneficial to SEOs, as competitors outranking our clients via spam will now be devalued in real time. Of course, Penguin 4.0 won’t help everyone: Penguin 3 demotions have been removed. So if you didn't recover, your links were probably all bad. @methode #pubcon — Jennifer Slegg (@jenstar) October 12, 2016 But if you’ve been securing real, worthwhile links, you should start to see signs of recovery. The fact that Google can evaluate links much faster also mitigates the efficacy of negative SEO. The feasibility of negative SEO (NSEO) is greatly diminished Penguin 4.0 should help end negative SEO problems. Although Google continues to deny NSEO, I personally find it hard to believe there were no instances of it affecting a site. Never seen a single case of negative SEO @methode @stonetemple @Pubcon #negativeseo #seo #pubcon pic.twitter.com/KSD1UxyaLP — Eugene Feygin (@rawseo) October 12, 2016 Either way, Penguin 4.0 should alleviate many concerns over negative SEO. The goal of NSEO was to have your competitor penalized, which is no longer possible, since Penguin won’t demote entire sites. Of course, manual actions are still possible. But according to Illyes, there isn’t any “trigger” you could trip with negative SEO that would flag a site for manual review. He says there isn't an automatic system to raise a flag for a site to get a manual review. — Marie Haynes (@Marie_Haynes) October 12, 2016 All of these factors mean NSEO should no longer be a feasible strategy for beating your competition. Penguin 4.0 should encourage site owners and SEOs to focus on optimizing and promoting their own sites, rather than tearing down competitors. The new Penguin is more granular This new iteration of Penguin is much more granular than previous versions. Penguin now devalues spam by adjusting ranking based on spam signals, rather than affecting ranking of the whole site. This is another significant improvement for Penguin. Rather than devaluing an entire site, Penguin can now pinpoint spammy links and devalue them at the page level. Penguin 4.0: It can work on pages/sections of site instead of demoting whole sites. #pubcon — Overit (@overit) October 12, 2016 Gary Illyes also explained in a recent podcast on Marketing Land that Google adds labels to links. The example labels Illyes provided were: footer; in-content; Penguin real-time; and disavowed. The fact that Google’s link evaluation is more sophisticated is good news for SEOs and the web community as a whole. If Google continues to be more granular and refined in devaluing manipulation, then real, hard-to-earn links de facto become more valuable. Penguin levels the playing field and rewards the best marketers. Penguin 4.0 pushes SEO closer to real marketing The improvements made to Penguin 4.0 provide more immediate rewards for legitimate practices because spam is devalued more efficiently. This shift will push the SEO industry as a whole toward real strategies, and away from manipulation. Of course, many successful and respected SEOs are already involved in real marketing. However, there are also many shady individuals and companies that claim to be SEOs while providing spammy services. Penguin 4.0 is another nail in the coffin for these unscrupulous agencies, and that’s good for the SEO industry as whole. Sites propped up by spam will be devalued, providing gains for those who secure links the right way. Also, if you’ve been dealing with issues from Penguin 3 — and have been working in earnest to correct these issues — you should start seeing signs of recovery. In fact, notable SEOs have already been sharing some nice recovery stories. Glenn Gabe has shared impressive examples of recovery: Another client from the UK reached out to me with substantial gains over the past week from Penguin 4 (w/more movement over the past 2 days) pic.twitter.com/HuEyQIsLRv — Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) October 6, 2016 As did Marie Haynes: Just got an email from a client that has been suppressed by Penguin for years. Wow. This is beautiful. pic.twitter.com/hSVIlalDWX — Marie Haynes (@Marie_Haynes) October 12, 2016 We’ve also seen positive movement for some of our Penguin-affected clients at Page One Power: Penguin 4.0 is continuing the trend that the original Penguin release began: eliminating the noise of link spam and allowing real, value-driven links to shine through. As spammy, manipulative practices become less and less effective and die off, the SEO industry as a whole will move to legitimate marketing. Improved practices lead to improved reputation, and I suspect we’ll look back at Penguin 4.0 as a boon for SEO and the health of the web overall.

Google Messenger Update Brings a Compact UI and New Circular Icons Google’s application was updated to version 2.0 Oct 25, 2016 14:00 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has been working on a new update to its Messenger application and it seems that version 2.0 has recently been made available to users in the Play Store. Google Messenger 2.0 comes with some UI changes and a new circular icon that resembles icons in the Pixel Launcher, available on Android 7.1 Nougat. It seems that Google has decided to make some UI changes to its Messenger application in order to make it more appealing to users and match the general design in Android 7.1 Nougat. The application icon is now circular, and it seems that the color scheme inside the app was also revised. Profile icons inside the messaging app are now smaller, which gives the whole application a slightly more polished look. Google also equipped messages with a more rounded bubble, which seems similar to Google Allo. Messages are more compact so that more lines of text are displayed, and the app now comes with a status marker that tells users whether the message was sent with an SMS or MMS. Google also made some functionality changes and bundled together Frequent and All contacts sections into the Top contacts area, which displays the eight most popular contacts in the address book. The list of all contacts is displayed immediately underneath the top eight contacts, in alphabetical order. With this update, the software giant wants to bring Messenger’s design closer to that of Android 7.1. Google’s other instant messaging application, Allo, was released earlier this year and comes with end-to-end encryption, aside from other neat features. Google Messenger version 2.0 is already available in the Google Play Store. #Google#Google Messenger#Play Store#Pixel Launcher#Android 7.1 Nougat reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Maps for iOS Gets Updated With Food Delivery Service Integration Google Photos to Start Showing Albums in Search Results Multi-Window Feature Not Present in the Beta Version of Android 7.1.1 Nougat Google Pixel Launcher Officially Available for Download OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon    Google Messenger version 2.0 New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Pictures and Specs of Google's Canned Project ARA Smartphone Leaked Out more on: Project Ara i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

By Miles Kehoe | Oct 25, 2016 CHANNEL: Information Management Organizations face many choices when it comes to enterprise search platforms PHOTO: Jeremy Miles Which search platform is the best for you and your business? This question pops up repeatedly on LinkedIn and other discussion boards as well as with clients. Tasked with making content available for internal users and external customers, IT and business staff in companies large and small don’t want to make a mistake.  It’s often an expensive one, and the wrong choice could be a career-limiting decision. A Look at the Search Market In the world of commercial products, Google, Microsoft and Coveo come to mind. In the open source-based universe, Apache Lucene and Apache Solr lead the pack, and in fact power the top open-source-based commercial products. Elasticsearch, Lucidworks’ Fusion and Attivio Active intelligence Engine lead the pack.  Let’s take a look at the options. Google Search Appliance The big yellow Google Search Appliance boxes became popular in corporations, because it was from Google and the magic, mystery and popularity of the public Google search site made it the clear choice for searching intranet and public-facing web content.  Unfortunately, the enormous context and activity that makes Google.com so successful was not available for the GSA, but it provided reasonable search.  But in February, Google announced the "end of life" for the GSA. Since the GSA depends on a Google-provided software license file, when your license expires, your GSA becomes a nice bright yellow Dell server.  Microsoft SharePoint Another popular option is Microsoft SharePoint.  Microsoft acquired FAST Search in 2008 and shifted the technology, the intellectual property and other aspects of the FAST product into SharePoint search.  SharePoint search may not be the best bet for heavy duty search applications, but within the SharePoint universe, it’s a pretty decent search platform and is tightly integrated with SharePoint. Coveo Coveo is in the unique position of providing a powerful Windows-based search platform which combines enterprise-wide search and predictive analytics that brings together all corporate content in what it calls the ‘Intelligent Workplace.” With connectors to a large number of enterprise repositories and full document-level security, Coveo is positioning itself to the enterprise where many other platforms are targeted more at diverse repositories. Attivio Attivio has wrapped a number of search-powered capabilities around a Lucene Solr base and markets its product as an "active intelligence engine." It recently positioned the technology as a Data Unification product.  Attivio, which has a number of former FAST employees, appears to be successful, but I don’t see them often in the enterprise search area. Lucene  In the open source works, the Apache Software Foundation is home to the Lucene search project, and is parent to the Apache Solr project. The Lucene project is essentially a low-level search API that can be integrated into applications that need search capability. This includes programs like Content Management Systems or other document repositories where content is easier to find using strong search capabilities.  As an API, applications that use Lucene are responsible for indexing content as well as for searching and displaying results. If a new document is added into, or removed from, a repository, you are responsible for updating the index. And since your application is responsible for maintaining the indices, if your application crashes, the index doesn’t get updated. If you need LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), Active Directory or other document level security, your application is responsible for filtering results: by default, Lucene does not handle security filtering on its own. Many solutions are out there for these and other shortcomings of stand-alone Lucene applications. And many organizations appear wiling to assume responsibility for integrating the required capabilities to save money — the licensing costs, if not staffing. Lucene, as an Apache project, is open source and free. Like most open source projects, anyone can download and modify the source code, and submit suggested changes back to the project to be evaluated for inclusion in future releases.  Like other Apache (and other open source projects), a team of developers known as ‘committers’ consider submissions, maintain the code, fix known bugs and add new features. Anyone who shows interest and competence in writing and fixing code can potentially be invited to become a committer. Elasticsearch Elasticsearch, a product from Elastic.co, is another open source product available as a free download under the Apache Software Foundation license. Elastic accepts code fixes and enhancement submissions from others, but it appears that only employees of Elastic are permitted to be committers.  Some supporting capabilities such as the browser-based analytics and search dashboard Kibana and ingestion tools Logstash and Beats are also open source, and part of the Elastic Stack. However, many of its most powerful supporting features — security (Shield), monitoring (Marvel), alerting (Watcher), graph and reporting — are proprietary and available only for licensing in X-Pack.  Solr Solr, a spin-off from Lucene and a sub-project under the Apache Lucene Project, is a search server. As a server, Solr is always running, includes the Lucene API, and performs tasks for applications that need search capabilities.  Solr has grown to be a quite complete and complex. It offers massive scalability, failover and redundancy with its Solr Cloud along with integration of another Apache project called Zookeeper. Search managers can add, remove or update content using simple commands sent to system ports.  And Solr comes with an easy to understand and manage console app which affords a high level view into Solr operations. Solr can be configured to continuously update the search index as content is added, updated or removed; and it not dependent on your application for scalability or updates. And it also supports frameworks to provide document level security. A number of open source projects work with Solr to crawl websites and other repositories, and to support ‘binary’ document formats such as Microsoft Office and PDF documents. Solr and its supporting tools do require maintenance and attention, but since the core applications are open source and free, many companies opt to invest in labor to install and maintain the search engine along with the search application that users work with to find content. Lucidworks Lucidworks, which employs a large number of the Lucene/Solr committers, also markets a commercial search platform called Fusion. Fusion falls into what I consider an “enterprise search” solution. While the underlying index is based on Apache Solr, Fusion adds: a powerful framework for ingesting content including documented indexing and query pipelines document level security with LDAP and Active Directory as well as a Kerberos authentication capability  a powerful and easy-to-use crawler (ANDA) for indexing content document filters to ingest Word and other document formats and a connector framework for accessing content in dozen of the most popular enterprise repositories.  These tools securely index and search extremely large content repositories, and provide flexibility to maximize user capabilities. Finally, Fusion comes with Spark to provide the capability to define and utilize "signals," such as purchases or document views or downloads to tune relevancy automatically. (In interest of full disclosure, I was an employee for Lucidworks for two years prior to the introduction of Fusion).  Which Search Platform Should You Choose? The question evokes discussions, heated debates and even Hatfield-McCoy-like discussions among search experts. But there is a clear answer, though it might not be the one you want to hear.  It depends.  As with many other software decisions, search, particularly enterprise-wide search, is not a “one size fits all.”   You need to consider your requirements including: the types and formats of the documents you need to search whether (and how) documents are secured what document formats do you use and how often they change how long or big are you average documents how many documents do you have where does your content live? SharePoint? File systems? DBMS?  how skilled are your users? Library scientists or average web visitors? what kind of content do you have? Office Docs? Log files?  what reporting capabilities do you need Next month I’ll describe how you can go about answering these and other questions, and how you can figure out which platform is best for you. If you have specific questions, let me know. About the Author Miles Kehoe is founder of New Idea Engineering, a vendor neutral consultancy focused on enterprise search, analytics and big data.

New Google Accounts Now Opted-In To Ad Tracking Features By Default Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share New Google Accounts Now Opted-In To Ad Tracking Features By Default Image courtesy of Google October 25, 2016 9:55 am EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc big data is watching google privacy android chrome my activity Remember when Google’s default setting was to maximize your privacy? Well, Google doesn’t. The internet’s biggest advertising company has now quietly shifted its baseline privacy behavior, so you’ll want to watch out if you’re creating any new accounts. As ProPublica explains, Google has shifted the default setting for all new accounts. While you used to have to opt-in to receive specific, personalized, tracking-based advertising, new accounts will have all those privacy-eroding settings enabled from the start. It’s basically the second step in a change that Google first unveiled back in June, when it opened its one-stop ad-and-privacy-settings shop. On Google’s Ads Settings page, you can determine whether or not Google is allowed to show you ads based on the interests and activity history it has associated with your profile. There are actually two ads settings pages, and each has a link to the other in the lower left-hand corner tile. “Control signed-in ads” is the toggle for when you are using a browser or device signed in to your Google account; “control signed-out ads” is the toggle to manage ads you see when not signed into Google. Those toggles look like this. You can also visit Google’s My Activity page to view the records Google has of your behavior across the internet, including which devices you use, what you’ve searched on YouTube, and your web and app activity. Clicking “review” under the history items will take you to the Google Privacy checkup, where you can go through and enable or disable various privacy settings for your Google account, YouTube, and various histories. Many of those settings contain links to other pages, which in turn contain links, but the My Activity page is, at its core, a node that will get you to all those other controls as long as you follow the breadcrumbs. However, while any user can choose to opt out, the fact that privacy is no longer Google’s default behavior is a really big deal, ProPublica explains. In a digital world increasingly dominated by Facebook, the ne plus ultra of targeted, focused behavioral tracking and data collection, it has become increasingly common to make a lack of privacy the default. Google’s separation of personally identifiable information and ad data, according to an expert ProPublica spoke with, “was a really significant last stand.” And now it’s over. A Google spokesperson told ProPublica that the company is simply responding to changes in the ways consumers interact with the internet. “We updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,” the rep wrote.

By Matt Asay | October 25, 2016, 5:51 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Stephen Shankland/CNET After using the Google Pixel for several days I'm happy to report that it's fantastic. I've rejected the hitherto clumsy Android interface for years, and even superior screens or cameras couldn't move me off my iPhone. The Google Pixel is the first Android phone that I'd happily swap for my iPhone. In fact, that's exactly what I have done this week, without missing a beat. Well, except for one, and it's a doozy. Everything about the Pixel experience "just works," except for its lack of support for Apple's iMessage. That's not Google's fault, but it's ultimately a headache that I'm not willing to embrace. Apple seems to view iMessage as a way to stoke sales of iOS devices. I'm not sure if that's true, but it does seem like a great way to block any potential exodus to Android. SEE: Google Pixel phone: The smart person's guide Fantastic phone, not so fantastic AI The more time I spend with the Pixel, the more I like it, and even prefer it in key ways to my iPhone 7. I've always liked the idea of Android more than the day-to-day experience it provides, but the Pixel makes it snappy, beautiful, and easier to organize than my iPhone. Given that many of my preferred services are owned by Google already, and those that aren't have data residing in the cloud, getting productive with my Pixel has been as easy as inputting my login credentials. As an added bonus, some of my favorite apps actually look and work better on Android than iOS. As a bundle of hardware and software, then, the Google Pixel is fantastic, and is serious competition for the relatively affluent buyer of Apple's iPhone. SEE: Is Google's Pixel phone a bigger threat to Samsung than exploding batteries? My primary reason for buying Google's Pixel was not the phone itself, however, but rather the potential for Google magic powering the overall experience. As widely reported, AI is the heart of the Google Pixel, and is arguably the Pixel's biggest selling point.

Unfortunately, despite a willingness to shovel as much of my data into Google as possible, it's not. At least, not yet. When everything goes well, then talking with my Pixel is great: I get a quick read on how long my commute will take, can send texts to friends as I drive (without typing), etc. But the "everything goes well" scenario happened so rarely that most of the time I had to enjoy the phone itself and forget its affectations of intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Still, this is no worse than my experience with Siri on my iPhone or the Amazon Echo (Alexa) in our kitchen. Each is an indication that, as Red Hat's Alessandro Perilli points out, "Progress made since 2012 is underwhelming." It's neat that AI can answer a few reasonably well-structured questions, but somewhat disappointing that this is pretty much all it can do. In short, the phone is on par with the iPhone, and better in some ways, while the AI is just as bad (or good, depending on how optimistic you want to be). But the reason I won't be keeping the Pixel is iMessage. The iMessage moat As an Apple executive told Walt Mossberg, Apple won't support iMessage on non-Apple devices because it gets no data benefit from doing so, and the company believes "a superior messaging platform that only work[s] on Apple devices...help[s] sales of those devices." It's not clear to me how iMessage stokes sales, because to outsiders it's just another way of sending text messages. The value isn't clear. SEE: Pixel, Galaxy, iPhone, oh my! Why pay a premium when every phone runs the same apps? (ZDNet) But to those of us who depend on it, and mostly as a way to send messages from a Mac, it's an effective way of keeping us from bolting for other platforms. Sure, there are kludgy workarounds that allow for sending/receiving iMessages on other platforms, but they're beyond what 99.999% of the world is willing to do. Over the last few days I straddled two worlds: The world of SMS/MMS and iMessage. I pulled my SIM card out of my iPhone and ongoing conversations with those friends and family effectively stopped. I'd have to start a new thread on my Pixel and it didn't flow as before. iMessage is a beautiful messaging service...and it's an Apple-only service. Am I happy about this? No. But communication is fundamental to why I use my phone, and until Apple relaxes its hold on iMessage I can't leave for Google's Pixel. For those of you not so constricted, however, get a Pixel.

Users have a choice of paying a fee per order or a monthly charge or an annual service fee. Google Express offers overnight delivery from a variety of stores through online or mobile device ordering. Costco, Walgreens, Toys"R"Us, and Petsmart are among merchants included in the service. The expansion pits Google Express against shopping and delivery services in the Triangle such as Amazon Prime and Instacart. An introductory offer includes a three-month membership at no charge. "Our goal with Google Express is to offer a great shopping experience and connect people with their favorite stores,” said Brian Elliott, General Manager of Google Express, in the expansion announcement. In addition to North Carolina, Google Express is expanding service to South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Kentucky. Other states added are: Utah, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Wyoming and Washington. An annual membership is $95. Monthly fee is $10. Pay-as-you-go charge is $4.99 or higher.

For the first time in three quarters of a century, people will be able to step inside the ruins of the old cathedral and see how it looked before the Blitz Ciarán Norris, Rising Global Peace Forum director ‘For the first time in three quarters of a century, people will be able to step inside the ruins of the old cathedral and see how it looked before the Blitz.’ The software is being developed by technology experts Sean Graham and Andrew Brooks at Coventry University. Mr Graham said: ‘In order to build an accurate digital reconstruction of the building we were able to use items from the Cathedral’s extensive archive including many documents which hadn’t seen the light of day for many decades. ‘As far as we’re aware this is the first time this Google Tango technology has been used to rebuild a historically significant place in this way.’ Coventry Cathedral was famously destroyed by the Luftwaffe in November 1940, with heavy bombing leaving only its tower, spire, outer wall and the tomb of its first bishop A ten-hour German raid devastated Coventry in November 1940 - leaving two thirds of its buildings damaged or destroyed Following the war a competition was launched to design a new cathedral, and the foundation stone was laid by the Queen in 1956. The cathedral is pictured above in November 1945 He added: ‘We hope that in the future we might be able to use it to create other significant buildings – particularly those which have been destroyed by conflict.’  Coventry Cathedral was bombed on November 14, 1940, when a ten-hour German raid devastated the city - leaving two thirds of its buildings damaged or destroyed. Following the war a competition was launched to design a new cathedral, and the foundation stone was laid by the Queen in 1956. The building was then consecrated six years later - and the shell of the medieval cathedral and its spire remain today as a memorial garden.

More About: The Changing Automotive Landscape Bill Ford Copyright William Thomas Cain, Getty Images Advertisement Bill Ford is tired of hearing the future of cars belongs to Silicon Valley. Yet for years, the Apple and Google crowd have been telling him that only Big Tech can make driverless vehicles. “There was this presumption that we were too dumb to get it,” said the Ford Motor Co. (IW 500/4) executive chairman and great-grandson of auto pioneer Henry Ford. “The conversation has really shifted.” He’s not kidding. Tech giants Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, once intent on disrupting, if not destroying, Detroit, have concluded for now that they don’t want to build cars. Sure, they still bank on supplying the autonomous software that will drive robot rides, but the concession that they’re not up to the complex task of mass production tilts the balance of power to traditional automakers. Popular Now Tesla’s Future in Trump’s World The Automotive Industry: Economic Impact And Location Issues Who is Killing American Manufacturing? Vehicle manufacturing is a massive undertaking. There is the metal bending and assembly, a highly evolved process in itself. Car companies also integrate millions of lines of code that control everything from the radio to the radar sensors that will soon allow hands-free driving. Detroit also has deep experience managing the long chain of suppliers that provide roughly 30,000 parts. All that complexity is “something a lot of I.T. companies getting into the business realized the hard way,”  James Kuffner, former head of Google Robotics and now chief technology officer at the Toyota Research Institute, said. “Despite what a venture capitalist tells you, making a car is hard.” Google Co-Founder Larry Page came to that conclusion when he confided in a private discussion earlier this year he was heartbroken by the slow pace of the company’s self-driving car project, said a person familiar with the meeting. Though Google began its autonomous-driving efforts well before other tech companies, its project has been plagued by uncertainty around its business model and executive departures. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. Related Eve of Disruption: How the Auto Industry Is Remaking Itself Automakers are Gearing up for Self-Driving Cars, But Is Anyone Else? Automakers, meanwhile, are pouring billions into developing their own self-driving systems. They’re already installing semi-autonomous features, such as automatic braking and technology to keep a car in its lane. And they’re working on building models that can withstand the punishing workload expected of robot taxis, which will likely amass 130,000 miles a year -- 10 times today’s total -- as they run 18 hours a day, 365 days a year. The robot rides will be replaced often and sold in high numbers, providing a big payoff for manufacturers that figure out the formula. 'We Don't Want to be the Handset' “The old conversation I used to have was, ‘You guys are going to end up being the handset, you’re going to be low-margin assemblers of other people’s cool technology,’” Ford said. “We don’t want to be the handset. And we won’t be.” That’s not to say auto companies haven’t tried working with Silicon Valley. Volvo Cars is providing sport utility vehicles to Uber Technologies Inc. for testing as robot taxis in Pittsburgh. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is supplying Google with 100 minivans for transformation into self-driving people haulers. Those deals could herald larger alliances. “Eventually, the incumbents and the disruptors will need to get together,” said Scott Corwin, who advises tech companies and automakers at Deloitte Consulting. “No single company has the resources or the know-how to put all the pieces together.” ‘Fear and Greed’ For now, the two industries view each other with suspicion. Each wants to stake its own claim to a driverless future and reap the rewards. Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co. and Ford have all conducted extensive talks with tech giants such as Google or Apple but in every case failed to come up with a way to share power. “It’s amazing to see these two sides. They look at each other and there’s fear and greed,” said Evan Hirsh, an auto-executive adviser at Strategy&, a PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC consulting group. “They really don’t understand each other.” Tech companies believe they could boost anemic margins in auto making if they had access to vehicle-performance data that would allow for more efficient manufacturing. Car companies control that data now and are unlikely to release it to a competitor. However the power-sharing arrangement shakes out, no single company will “own the brain” of the autonomous car, said Swamy Kotagiri, chief technology officer of Magna International, a veteran contract manufacturer that will build the BMW 5-Series. Automakers probably will control safety systems, while tech companies will handle “enjoyment, convenience and comfort data,” such as Apple’s CarPlay dashboard infotainment system, he said. Luring Talent Where automakers come up short is attracting sufficient numbers of software engineers, which they lack by the thousands. Technology now represents half the cost of a car, according to Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association. But luring tech talent away from Silicon Valley hasn’t been easy. “Talk to any automaker or big supplier, and they will all tell you they are woefully lacking in software-development capabilities,” Hirsh said. “They can’t hire.” Car companies are trying to fix that. GM’s $1 billion acquisition of self-driving startup Cruise Automation has helped the automaker attract talent, Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told a tech conference in Detroit last month. Meanwhile, GM and Ford are expanding their Silicon Valley research labs, but their presence and reputation still lags the tech players. That’s why U.S. automakers and suppliers are working hard to develop the Detroit area as a competing center of autonomous automotive development, with robot-car test tracks and R&D facilities. “In Silicon Valley, the auto industry is a small player in a big pond,” Matt Simoncini, CEO of auto supplier Lear Corp., said on October 18 at the dedication of a $10 million innovation center in Detroit. “And then you come back here. We are ‘the’ player in this pond.” By Keith Naughton, Alex Webb and Mark Bergen Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 5 RichandNotFamous on Oct 26, 2016 I don't think anyone seriously thought heavy manufacturing would take root at the epicenter of displaced labor. You'd have to relocate thousands of recruiters just to write job descriptions. There's a massive manufacturing machine, custom made for automobiles, sitting in Michigan where the only thing missing is work (and police). Trying to rebuild that elsewhere is just bad business and the big drivers (Ha) of autonomous cars aren't famous for bad business. Beyond that, where would the workers come from? Where would they live? You're not going to get career tech people to leave their jobs with tech companies. Housing prices there are ridiculous. So much so that small plane traffic is becoming a problem as a 200 mile round trip commute is no longer just for senior management. You're going to have to import factory workers and pay them enough to live somewhere they can afford and have families. You don't need an analyst to tell you the cost of a car built in that environment is going to be outrageous. Far beyond what people can afford. As an aside, Larry Page is always heartbroken when a side project doesn't play out like he wanted. I can't decide if he's really that personally vested in those projects, or if his understanding of the word is different from everybody else's. Regardless, don't read too much into it when he's heartbroken. Log In or Register to post comments kyoshi on Oct 26, 2016 All excellent points. Reminds me of one of my favorite sayings, "the less you know about a subject, the simpler it seems". I find the thought of thousands of software geeks trying to design, build, and produce a drive train and suspension hilarious in the extreme. If they want to build their own car they should start by waiting for the economy to crash and buy a major automaker on the cheap. They could probably get a good deal of Fiat/Chrysler right now!

I find it interesting that Apple and Google thought that they could disrupt the automotive manufacturers as both GM and Ford participated in the DARPA Grand Challenges. What Apple and Google succeeded in doing was accelerating the effort to bring this type of technology to market, although I believe and we are already seeing it seep into newer vehicles with Lane Departure Warning and Automatic Braking. Full guidance, a la the Grand Challenges, is still a ways away but the car companies are now actively involved in developing the technology rather than letting others become the technical leads. I will grant you that the automotives lack the culture and talent, but I suspect that that will change. Finally, there is also the problem of politics, and my suspicion is that once the technology has been integrated into production vehicles and proven itself out that the insurance companies will create economic incentives that will drive its mass adoption.

Virtual reality could be the next domino to fall in the Google onslaught. Spotted originally by Mattermark, Eyefluence has been brought into the Google family to bolster capabilities ahead of the launch of the Daydream View virtual reality headset in November. Google has made its intentions clear of its desire to play in the VR world so this acquisition should not come as a huge surprise considering the Google exec team has a knack of spotting a good acquisition. It’s $500 million acquisition of Deepmind in 2014 is starting to look like a bit of a bargain as well. “Today, we are excited to announce that the Eyefluence team is joining Google!” the company said on its blog. “With our forces combined, we will continue to advance eye-interaction technology to expand human potential and empathy on an even larger scale.  We look forward to the life-changing innovations we’ll create together!” Google has yet to made a comment on the acquisition, though eye tracking capabilities are imperative should the team want to make a truly immersive experience. Only last week at VR & AR World commentators noted there is yet to be a blockbuster VR experience to kick-start the industry, though content is limited to date. Eyefluence could be the missing part to the Google puzzle to take the product to the next level. Although there has been progress made in the VR world it is still early days. For most, the kit is still too expensive, and while this is still the case breaking into the mass market will almost be impossible. Google is trying its best to democratize VR with the introduction of Daydream View for $79 in November. The team has also filed documents with the FCC to see whether it can test a wireless device on its employees and other partners. The document does not explicitly state VR is the target, though one of the main contacts is Mike Jazayeri, one of the senior product managers in the VR development team. Although Daydream View is a phone orientated headset, this new one (assuming it is a wireless headset for VR) could take Google into the more premium end of the market. Google has a track record of throwing money around and dominating new markets, and if history is anything to go by, this could be another to add into the portfolio.

Google's new Pixel XL was an obvious choice for anyone whose plans to buy the Galaxy Note 7 were thwarted by the recall and eventual discontinuation of the handset. However, Xiaomi's new Mi Note 2 is another contender for the title of the best Android phablet, one that cannot be easily ignored. If you are confused whether you should order Google Pixel XL or wait for the launch of Xiaomi Mi Note 2 as the replacement for Samsung Galaxy Note 7, read this comparison to make a decision. Readers should note however that we haven't yet spent any time with the Mi Note 2, and our final judgement will have to wait for our complete review. Thus, this comparison is based on features and specifications on paper.Design In terms of design, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 is a lot closer to Samsung Galaxy Note 7 than the Pixel XL is. The new Xiaomi phablet has dual curved screen as well as 3D curved back, similar to what we had seen with the Galaxy Note 7; the frame on the side is made of metal. The bezels around the screen are pretty thin, due to which the phone's body is not much bigger than that of Pixel XL despite the bigger display. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, looks similar to the iPhone 7 Plus and does not have the curves that its Xiaomi rival flaunts. Instead, it has thick bezels around the screen, metallic back panel, the fingerprint sensor on the back, and no physical buttons in front. At 8.5mm, it is a little thicker than Mi Note 2 (7.6mm). On the other hand, the Google phone is dust- and splash-resistant, something the Xiaomi model is vulnerable to. (Also see:Google Pixel, Pixel XL First Impressions) Display Both Xiaomi Mi Note 2 (5.7-inch) and Google Pixel XL (5.5-inch) feature the energy-efficient OLED panels; the Google handset comes with Gorilla Glass 4 protection, while Xiaomi has not announced what protection it has provided to the screen of its new model. Pixel XL has the same QHD display resolution as Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (1440x2560 pixels), while Mi Note 2's resolution lags at full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) Specs aside, wait for our first impressions of Xiaomi Mi Note 2 to decide which phone has the superior screen. Software In terms of software, Pixel XL is ahead of Mi Note 2, on the back of Android 7.1 Nougat, the latest version of Google's mobile OS. The software comes with the company's new Google Assistant and Pixel Launcher (which offers a new Camera app, revamped Dialer app, rounded app icons, wider selection of wallpapers, etc). The software is the best Google is offering at the moment, offering snappy performance and smooth transitioning between apps. Plus, Google is giving Pixel XL buyers unlimited free cloud storage for photos for life. On the other hand, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 runs the MIUI 8 system, which is based on last year's Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system. The software has a number of cool features, such as Dual Apps, Quick Ball, Second Space and Scrolling Screenshots, among others. Despite the great features, the Mi Note 2 does not offer a virtual helper like Google Assistant, which is widely considered as the next frontier in smartphone software. (Also see: Google Pixel Phones: 10 Things the Google Assistant Can Do) Google Pixel XL is for the early adopters who want the latest Android version and a taste of Google Assistant, while those who do not consider these a primary concern can wait for Xiaomi Mi Note 2. Processing muscle Both Xiaomi Mi Note 2 and Google Pixel XL are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor; however, the Xiaomi model's chipset has primary cores running at 2.35GHz, compared to the 2.15GHz primary cores of Pixel XL. Moreover, while the Pixel handset comes with only 4GB RAM, Xiaomi offers buyers the option of going for either 4GB or 6GB RAM, depending on storage. Storage The base variant of Google Pixel XL comes with 32GB of inbuilt storage, while its top model has 128GB storage; both versions have 4GB RAM. Mi Note 2 buyers can either go for the 64GB + 4GB option or the 128GB + 6GB model. Neither smartphone supports microSD cards for storage expansion. Camera Google Pixel XL sports a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture, phase-detection autofocus (PDAF) as well as laser autofocus, HDR+ support, 4K recording, and dual-tone, dual-LED flash. The only gripe some photography enthusiasts have with the camera of this smartphone the absence of Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS), which is compensated with Electronic Image Stabilisation (EIS); however, reviews have raved about the camera capabilities of the Pixel XL. The front camera of the smartphone has 8-megapixel resolution with f/2.4 aperture. On the other hand, Xiaomi Mi Note 2's camera is an unknown quantity for everyone, as the device was unveiled just a few hours ago. The camera has a 22.56-megapixel camera with f/2.0 aperture, PDAF and laser autofocus, HDR support, 4K recording and dual-tone, dual-LED flash, and Electronic Image Stabilisation. Its selfie camera has 8-megapixel resolution with f/2.0 aperture, meaning it may take slightly better photos in lowlight conditions. If you are in the market for a smartphone that can handle all your photography demands, then you cannot go wrong with the Pixel XL. Battery Xiaomi Mi Note 2 has a 4070mAh battery, much bigger than the Pixel XL's 3450mAh capacity. The former supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 fast-charging technology, but Xiaomi has refused to provide charging time figures. On the other hand, Google relies on USB Power Delivery (PD) for fast charging, and Google says users can get 7 hours of battery life with 15 minutes of charging. Unique features Google Pixel XL has an all-metal design with limited splash- and dust-resistance, powerful speakers, the latest software, and an AI-powered digital assistant. On the other hand, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 provides buyers with curved display on both sides, dual-SIM support, and relatively faster LTE speeds. Neither phone sports a stylus or an iris scanner, unlike the Galaxy Note 7. Price When it comes to price, Xiaomi Mi Note 2 is a definite winner as it costs nearly 40 percent lesser than Google Pixel XL. The Xiaomi handset costs CNY 2,799 (roughly Rs. 28,000), CNY 3,299 (approximately Rs. 32,500) and CNY 3,499 (around Rs. 35,000) for the 64GB/4GB, 128GB/6GB, and 128GB+6GB Global Edition, respectively. On the other hand, Google Pixel XL's 32GB and 128GB models are priced at Rs. 67,000 and Rs. 76,000, respectively. So go for the Xiaomi phone if you do not want to burn a hole in the pocket, while Pixel XL is perfect for those who do not consider money a criterion while deciding which smartphone to buy. We remind readers that our final judgement will have to wait for our complete review both phones.

Next Story How smartphone cameras took over the world Transportation Cars Google's self-driving car design boss speaks on her strategy Designing a car that's not for drivers By Tamara Warren on October 25, 2016 09:09 am @tamaratam 51 Tweet Share Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share As the head of design for Google’s self-driving car program, YooJung Ahn has figured out how to design a car for people who aren’t the least bit interested in driving. She oversaw the design of the company’s autonomous car prototype, the first car being tested publicly without a steering wheel or pedals. The challenge is that people who will ride in the Google car aren’t drivers, they are users. That beginning premise has framed everything about the design program for the Google car, since it launched over seven years ago. And Ahn’s experience has been at the center of it. "We tried not to consider the product as one more car on the road. That’s the last thing we wanted to do," Ahn told me earlier this month. "We want to switch the paradigm." Google has been mum about its process for building and operating self-driving cars, and has even made the name of its self-driving car arm Alphabet, and research being done at X, hard to pin down. We know that Google cars have covered over 2 million miles and that the public face of the Google self-driving project, Chris Urmson, recently left the company.The Verge has ridden in several of Alphabet’s self-driving cars as the technology has evolved. As of September, Google had 34 prototype vehicles and 24 Lexus RX450h SUVs on the road. "We started with something that didn’t exist before." We know that Google isn’t a car company — at least yet — and doesn’t need to sell cars in order to exist. But after Google received the Red Dot Luminary Award a prestigious international award in the design community, for its prototype of the self-driving car, the company reached out to let me know that Ahn was available for a phone interview. The Red Dot jury praised the Google car for the innovative nature of its design, but also for its spaciousness, elegance, and simplicity; the car is being displayed at the Red Dot Museum in Singapore. "It was the design for the very first prototype and it wasn’t style-oriented," Ahn tells me. "We were very happy, because people understood the way we think. They understood what we are trying to do, to push that design for the bigger mission — how can we change mobility? As Ahn’s profile is raised in the public eye, there will be much talk about how she isn’t trained as a traditional car designer, and how as a woman, she’s in a small esteemed group of female lead designers. And perhaps, because she didn’t grow up dreaming of designing cars, she is distinct. But what she does share with other car designers, many of whom have also worked in product design studios, is that she is determined to solve problems through design strategy. And by landing at Google as it makes strides in the automotive arena, she is presented with a unique opportunity as the Mountain View company reveals its vision for the future. (Ahn is now leading Google’s autonomous design of the Chrysler Pacifica.) Ahn was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. She began painting as a kid and settled on her aspirations to become a designer when she was a teenager. She studied industrial design at Hong-Ik University and earned a master’s degree in design methods and strategies from the Illinois Institute of Technology. She worked for Motorola and LG Electronics before Google. She joined the self-driving design team in 2012 and was given the lead role in 2013. "As a product designer, I had a lot of advantages," she says. "Senior [car] designers know so much that they cannot get outside of the box easily. Since I did not know much about how car design works, we focused on maximum visibility, technology, safety, and what the user’s needs were while we were designing." Like the typical designer, she has an eye She’s certainly not interested in mimicking any preconceived standards about what makes a car cool, which is likely why Google chose her to the lead the program, to avoid falling into any well-worn patterns. But her background in mobile product is becoming more common in car company design studios, such as BMW, Fiat Chrysler, and Ford, which are actively recruiting from other industries. The makeup of her team shares much in common with the traditional car outfit. She works with industrial designers, CAD modelers, prototypers, and color and material designers. Like the typical designer, she has an eye. She says her personal style is minimalist, but she is adamant that her taste doesn’t define her process. "I try not to focus on my personal aesthetics. Personally I like simple design and I don’t like frills or unnecessary details," she says. When I ask her about how her artistry is reflected in her process, she pauses, and instead spoke to her larger mission. "After designing products for years, I realized that designers need to think fundamentally about what will actually change people’s lives." Ahn tells me repeatedly that safety is key to making the Google car. In the early days of self-driving cars, riders will need to trust the machine over the mind. Research predicts that autonomous cars will eventually make our roads safer and will cut down on the 35,000 traffic deaths that occur in the US every year. But for that prediction to come true, first consumers have to be willing to try them. At this point, most Americans express skepticism and resistance to giving up their control of the steering wheel. To change that, Ahn is designing the Google car interior to be a soothing environment. She wants passengers to feel safe, but also relaxed. The open seats are made of compressible foam, also used on the front bumper, which Ahn says is more comfortable than traditional seats. Buttons and controls are kept to a minimum. "We needed to create something relatable and intuitive, which is not confusing," Ahn says. "People had never imagined anything like that before." Photo: Peter Prato The exterior shape also speaks to this concept of safety. Its soft, round edges are coated in foam and the windshield is made from polycarbonate. It bares a distant resemblance to the circuitous shape of the first VW Beetle or a '50s-era Fiat 500, cars often described as cute. The sensors and lights on the Google prototype don’t feel sterile, stark, or sharp; there’s depth and fluidity across the surfaces. That’s why its prototype is like the little white bubble car that could. While the prototype has logged many miles, it’s still not ready for public consumption. It was designed for the US only and for a mild climate like California — not for harsh weather. "We will learn a lot more over time," Ahn says, "This prototype design is still on the learning curve from a technology and design standpoint." But Ahn is confident that the self-driving technology will take hold in this country, and consumers will eventually embrace the Google car. "Everybody has smart phones right now, but when you look back 10 years, nobody had them," she says. "I think it will take a longer time than other products, because a car is naturally very complex." But driverless cars will be the future, she assures me.

Well the timing of this handset couldn’t be better, but lets see how it fare against the Google Pixel XL. Display Featuring a large 5.7 inch Full HD OLED display (386ppi), the phone comes with a dual-curved design with 77.2% screen to body ratio, while the Google pixel XL comes built with a 5.5 inch QHD AMOLED display (534 ppi) backed with 71.2% screen to body ratio. Hardware The Mi Note 2 comes in two variants of 4GB RAM, 64GB storage/6GB RAM 128GB storage and speeds on Quad-core (2x2.35 GHz Kryo & 2x1.6 GHz Kryo) Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, while the Google Pixel Xl backs on 4GB RAM 32/128 GB storage paired with Quad-core (2x2.15 GHz Kryo & 2x1.6 GHz Kryo) Qualcomm MSM8996 Snapdragon 821 SoC. Camera Xiaomi has gone with a 22.56MP Sony IMX218 Exmor sensor with an f/2.0 lens and EIS digital stabilization that does 4K video recording. The main camera also gets added features like 3-axis gyroscope that promises excellent real-time jitter compensation along with hybrid PDAF and contrast autofocus system as well as a dual-tone LED flash along with its own proprietary low light and long exposure technology. At front is the 8MP Sony IMX268 sensor with additional optimizations like Beautify 3.0 and group selfies. Google Pixel XL on the other hand uses a 12MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture and new Electronic Image Stabilization, laser autofocus, dual-tone LED flash. The front facing 8MP senor comes with f/2.4 aperture. Features Xiaomi Mi Note 2 works on Android OS, v6.0 with MIUI 8.0 and for connectivity, the Mi Note 2 comes with global LTE support, high-precision GPS as well as NFC module and powers on a hefty 4070mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0. Google Pixel XL on the other hand runs on the latest Android OS v7.1 (Nougat) and comes with LTE and USB Type-C technology while powering the phone is the 3,450mAh battery with fast charging. Verdict In terms of hardware both go head on without cutting a slack, but the area where Mi Note 2 could feel the heat is on the software front as Pixel XL would always be on top of the league with all latest updates in the OS.

25 interesting facts about Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page TV MOVIES TOP TENS MUSIC LIFESTYLE FLASH GAMES Monster Lists Amazing Worlds Bizarre Life Pop Culture Movies Music Richest Sport Speed Tech You+ 25 interesting facts about Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page October 25, 2016 by Lucy Wreathe Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page, right, are two of the world’s most powerful people Sergey Brin and Larry Page are the two young, brilliant mathematicians-cum-entrepreneurs who co-founded Google. Take a peek into their public and private lives with these surprising facts and interesting bits of trivia. 1Page fell in love with computers age 6 Larry Page grew up in Michigan. His dad was a pioneering computer science professor at Michigan State University, and his mom taught computer programming. Larry claims he became enamored with computers when he was only six years old, which, for some reason, we don’t find surprising. 2He once built a printer out of Lego Page earned his undergraduate degree at Michigan State University, just like his father. While there, Page built an inkjet printer entirely out of Lego. 3He’s always been pretty confident Page once told his teachers at Stanford that he was going to download the whole internet on to his computer. Of course, his professors thought he was crazy, but a little company called Google might have changed their minds since. 4Brin’s family emigrated to flee persecution Sergey Brin, whose father was a Soviet mathematician economist, was born to a Jewish family in Moscow.  In 1979, he and his family fled persecution and emigrated to America. Brin earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science at the University of Maryland, and enrolled at Stanford to achieve his graduate degree. 5Brin loves lock-picking…and trapeze While a student at Stanford, Brin experimented with different lock-picking techniques. Lock-picking is a popular hobby for computer hackers, but Brin’s other love, performing as a trapeze artist, has got to be far less common. 6Israel made an impression on Brin Brin was bored in Hebrew School as a child, but when he traveled to Israel with his family at age 11, the experience stuck with him. As a result, Google now has annual Passover seders for Jewish employees. 7They took a while to become friends The pair met in the middle of the 1990s while both earning their doctorate degree in computer sciences at Stanford University. Brin and Page didn’t become fast friends on the spot, but later, when working on a dorm project, they became close companions. 8Google was first titled BackRub Google was first tentatively titled BackRub. Working together from their school dorm, Brin and Page created the early version of Google as a search engine that would list results by page popularity, since the pair figured (and rightly so!) that this would be the most useful way to sort through results. 9Google is a misspelling of ‘googol’ The guys came up with the name “Google” as a joke misspelling of the term “googol,” which means a huge number. The general public may not know what it means, but it makes a bit more sense than BackRub. 10Brin is still a Stanford ‘student’ Brin is still officially on leave from Stanford, even though both he and Page dropped out of college after inventing BackRub and changing its name to Google. Maybe he’ll go back for a degree in business. 11Friends and family helped pay for Google Google was officially launched on September 7, 1998, from a site (no pun intended) to be immemorial for centuries to come: a friend’s garage. In order to finance the project, Brin and Page collected $1million from very generous family, friends, and investors. 12They don’t accept adverts for guns The duo would like to be known for their mantra, which is “Don’t be evil”. Page clarified that this means he and Brin want to provide only the best service for their users and customers, and includes not accepting advertisements for guns or hard liquor. However, beer, wine, and pornography ads are allowed. 13Their baby was an instant hit Google was immediately extremely popular, garnering 10,000 hits per day – no small feat. Today, Google gets over 200 million queries a day. Talk about growth! 14They love to keep employees happy Google’s Californian headquarters are based in Mountain View in Silicon Valley. True to their character, Brin and Page make sure to include a few quirks to keep themselves and their staff cheerful: there is a masseuse present at all times, a piano, and weekly roller-hockey games in the company’s car park. Every employee gets one day per week to work on whatever individual projects they’d like. 15You can bring your dog to work at Google Brin and Page make the Google work environment a fun and collegiate-like place to be employed. Google allows dogs to roam freely around its headquarters, and Google’s head chef, Charlie Ayers, used to cook for The Grateful Dead. 16They have REAL first world problems Brin and Page have been overheard arguing about what kind of beds to put in their Boeing 767 wide-body corporate jet. Court documents unearthed during a battle between a fired designer contracted to work on the plane and Google’s holding company for the aircraft state that Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who was present at the time of the argument and stopped it, called the jet a “party plane”. Apparently, Brin and Page wanted a cocktail lounge and hammocks suspended from the ceiling in their jet. 17Brin and Page live modestly Despite being billionaires, Brin and Page both live relatively modestly (disregarding the airplane incident, that is). They have reportedly both driven the environmentally friendly Toyota Prius, a partly electric-powered car that many Mother Earth-oriented Americans use. They tend to dress in t-shirts and jeans – typical boys-next-door. 18China’s been interesting for them When Google launched in China in 2005, Brin and Page censored its search engine. Controversial subjects like the Falun Gong movement and the Tiananmen Square massacre were blocked. After severe Western protests, Brin and Page both admitted that this was a bad move both morally and for business. No kidding. 19Brin earned $4billion at age 31 Brin was the youngest member of the Forbes 400 richest people in the world in 2004, at age 31. He and Page both reaped $4billion each that year, tying for the No. 43 spot. 20They are worth A LOT Brin and Page are currently worth more than $35billion each. Page is thought to edge Brin out by a narrow margin – he is worth $.7billion more. 21Brin’s ex-wife was also an entrepreneur Brin’s ex-wife, popular biotech analyst Anne Wojcicki, left her job to found a genetic startup company called 23 and Me. Wojcicki says she wants to help unravel important DNA mysteries and help the world understand DNA. The pair divorced in June 2015. 22They’re always looking to the future Page and Brin keep a private list of employee ideas called the “Google Top 100”, comprised of the Google team’s own pet ideas and projects. So far, Google News and the social networking site Orkut have been the top fully realized products from the list. 23The pair are passionate about the environment Brin and Page have been investing in Nanosolar, a company that produces thin-film solar cells, for years. While less efficient than traditional crystalline cells, thin-film cells can be printed on plastic sheets that can cover more area on surfaces like roofs and walls. Brin and Page are known for their passionate interest in the environment. 24They respect the past Page and Brin have spoken out in defense of print newspapers in the past, saying that they still believed in the medium’s future. However, both admitted to getting most of their news online — not a good sign for the newspaper industry. 25In 2005 they were paid $1 a year Both men followed in the footsteps of other frugal entrepreneurs when they asked to be paid $1 per year in both 2005 and 2006. While some may see this as a risky move, the pair planned to rely on stock options and grants of company stock for their daily living expenses. Whatever the outcome of the the duo’s newest risk-taking venture, one thing is for sure: Google will continue to change the face of internet search as we know it for years to come.

As a reporter who covers tropical diseases, my search history is littered with Zika references, which could explain the algorithm’s conclusion jump. But it made me wonder if other people had been searching this term, and what else they were asking Google about the mosquito-borne virus, which has led to more than 4,000 infections in the US. As the virus continues to spread and a potential second wave of infections could soon hit during the warmer rainy season in South America, Zika will continue to be an issue for months to come. So I asked Google: what do people want to know? Here are top five most-searched Zika-related terms around the globe from the past year, according to a Google spokesperson, starting with the most-Googled question. Each question is answered by yours truly: 1. What is Zika virus? Zika virus is a mosquito-spread viral infection. Mosquitoes spread the virus by biting infected people and then biting new, uninfected people, but it can also be sexually transmitted. It was first discovered in the 1940s but gained notoriety this year due to a massive outbreak in Latin America that showed the virus can cause serious birth defects, like microcephaly: a condition where the baby’s head is smaller than usual, and the brain is often underdeveloped as a result. 2. Where is Zika virus? As of October 20, Zika has been detected in 73 countries around the world, according to the World Health Organization. Latin America has been hit the hardest, but the disease has emerged locally (meaning people are getting infected by mosquitoes there, not traveling to other countries and bringing it home) in other areas including the United States, Singapore, and Fiji. Countries with locally-transmitted Zika from 2013-2016. Image: World Health Organization 3. What are the symptoms of Zika virus? The most common symptoms are a fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes. Some people report muscle soreness and headache, as well. It’s similar to the flu, but for the vast majority of people, 80 percent, Zika causes no symptoms at all. Of those who do get sick, it’s usually mild. Common symptoms of a Zika infection. Image: Centers for Disease Control 4. What does Zika virus do? For most people, Zika doesn’t do anything. Some people may have a short illness with a fever and joint pain, but they’ll recover in about a week. For pregnant women in their first trimester, however, Zika is serious because it can cause birth defects. Women are most at risk if they get infected during the first trimester of their pregnancy, but researchers estimate the risk is still low—anywhere from less than 1 percent to 13 percent. 5. Is Zika contagious? No, Zika virus is not contagious the way the common cold is. You catch Zika by being bitten by an infectious mosquito, or through sexual transmission from an infected person. Zika can also be passed from mother to child in pregnant women, which is how the virus can cause birth defects. But if your roommate comes back from a trip to a Zika-infected area and has a fever, there’s no need to quarantine him.

In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, the Republican presidential nominee said defeating Islamic State was a higher priority than persuading than Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to step down, playing down a long-held goal of US policy. Trump questioned how his Democratic opponent would negotiate with Russia’s president Vladimir Putin after having demonized him; blamed Barack Obama for a downturn in US relations with the Philippines under its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind his candidacy and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders supported him. “If we had party unity, we couldn’t lose this election to Hillary Clinton,” Trump said. As they go to the polls in a historic presidential election, more than six in 10 Americans say neither major political party represents their views any longer, a survey has found. Dissatisfaction with both Democrats and Republicans has risen sharply since 1990, when less than half held that neither reflected their opinions, according to research by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). A former aide to Republican governor Chris Christie reiterated today that a now-infamous email she sent saying “time for some traffic problems” near the George Washington bridge in 2013 referred to a traffic study, not a political retaliation plot. Trump implied today that he would be willing to fight the sitting vice-president Joe Biden behind a barn. Speaking at a rally in Tallahassee, Florida, almost precisely two weeks to the minute to when polls close there on election day, Trump said of a fist fight between the two: “I’d love that.” The 70-year-old Republican nominee for president also labeled the vice-president “Mr Tough Guy” and said of beating up the 73-year-old Biden: “Some things in life you could really love doing.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.53pm EDT 21:53 Megyn Kelly and Newt Gingrich spar over sexual assault Fox News host Megyn Kelly and former House speaker Newt Gingrich engaged in an aggressive argument tonight over lingering questions regarding Donald Trump’s treatment of women and how it might affect him in the coming presidential election, with Gingrich accusing Kelly of bias against Trump and Kelly urging Gingrich to “take your anger issues and spend some time working on them.” “I’m sick and tired of people like you using language that’s inflammatory that’s not true!” Gingrich shouted. “I think that is exactly the bias that people are upset by!” “I think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes, sir,” Kelly deadpanned. “What I said is, if Donald Trump is a sexual predator, then it’s a big story. What we saw on that tape was Trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will,” Kelly continued, referring to a 2005 tape that showed Trump bragging about being able to sexually assault women with impunity because of his fame. “Then we saw ten women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a debate, to say ‘that was untrue, he did it to me; he did it to me; he did it to me.’ We saw it with reporters, people who had worked with him, people from Apprentice, and so on and so forth. He denies it it all, which is his right - we don’t know what the truth is.” “My point to you is, as a media story, we don’t get to say the ten women are lying,” Kelly continued. “We have to cover that story, sir.” Gingrich dismissed Kelly’s assertion, and decried the amount of focus paid on Trump’s sexual assault accusations. “You are fascinated with sex, and you don’t care about public policy!” Gingrich responded. “And that’s what I get out of watching you tonight.” “I’m not fascinated by sex, but I am fascinated by protection of women and understanding what we’re getting in the Oval Office,” Kelly retorted. “It’s not about me - it’s about the women and men of America, and the poll numbers show us that the women of America, in particular, are very concerned about these allegations.” The former speaker of the House of Representatives responded by “daring” Kelly to call former president Bill Clinton a “sexual predator,” which Kelly ignored. “We’re gonna have to leave it at that, and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them, Mister Speaker,” Kelly concluded. “And you too,” Gingrich responded meekly. The Trump campaign swiftly responded, deeming Gingrich’s appearance a success: Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) .@NewtGingrich just destroyed @MegynKelly. Shows she is totally biased against Mr. Trump & not very smart. Mr. Trump has long known!!

No, I wish we were in high school and I could take him behind the gym. That’s what I wish.” Biden made the comments in reference to a lewd 2005 tape recording of Trump, unearthed in early October, where the Republican nominee bragged about being able to grab women by the genitalia without their consent. On Monday, Biden clarified his remarks in a rally, saying he meant “If I were in high school ... I want to make it clear I understand what assault is. I’m not in high school. If I were in high school.” The septuagenarian graduated from the Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware, in 1961.

Dissatisfaction with both Democrats and Republicans has risen sharply since 1990, when less than half held that neither reflected their opinions, according to research by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). The seventh annual 2016 American Values Survey was carried out throughout September among a random sample of 2,010 adults in all 50 states. Both party establishments have been rattled by the outsider challenges of Donald Trump, who was successful in winning his party’s nomination, and Bernie Sanders, who was not. In a year that seems ripe for third-party candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green party are seeking to capitalise but have fallen back in the polls in recent weeks. Sixty-one per cent of survey respondents say neither political party reflects their opinions today, while 38% disagree. Nearly eight in 10 (77%) independents and a majority (54%) of Republicans took this position, while less than half (46%) of Democrats agree. There was virtually no variation across class or race. Both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican standard bearer Trump continue to suffer historically low favourability ratings, with less than half of the public viewing each candidate positively (41% v 33%). Clinton is viewed less favourably than the Democratic party (49%), but Trump’s low rating is more consistent with the Republican party’s own favourability (36%). The discontent with parties and candidates extends to the electoral process itself, which Trump claims is rigged against him. Less than half the public (43%) say they have a great deal of confidence that their vote will be counted accurately, while 38% have some confidence and 17% have hardly any confidence.

How to use IF functions in Google sheets (with examples) CodeProject IF function in Google Sheets can be used when you want to check a condition and then based on it, returns a specified value if it’s TRUE, or else returns the other specified value. For example, suppose you are evaluating marks obtained by students in an exam and you want to know if the student has passed or not. In this case, you can use the IF function and if the score is greater than 35, it would return “Pass”, else it would return “Fail”. Syntax of IF function in Google Sheets IF(logical_expression, value_if_true, value_if_false) logical_expression – This is the condition that you check in the function. It is an expression or reference to a cell containing an expression that would return a logical value, i.e., TRUE or FALSE. value_if_true – The value the function returns if logical_expression is TRUE. value_if_false (optional argument) – The value the function returns if logical_expression is FALSE. If you don’t specify the value_if_false argument and the checked condition is not met, the function would return FALSE. Now let’s look at some examples to understand how to use IF function in Google Sheets in real life scenarios. Example 1: Checking a Single Condition With If Function Suppose you have the marks of students in an exam and you want to specify whether a student has passed or failed (as shown below). You can easily find this out by using the IF function in Google Sheets. Here is the formula that will do this: =IF(B2>35,"Pass","Fail") It checks whether the score is more than 35 or not. If it is, then it returns Pass, else it returns Fail. Example 2: Checking Multiple Conditions With If Function Using the same example as above, what if you have a grading system in school and you have to assign a grade to a student based on the marks obtained. For example, a student gets F grade if he/she gets less than 35, D for marks between 35 and 50, C for marks between 50 and 70, B for marks between 70 and 90 and A above 90 (as shown below): In this case, you not only need to check whether the marks are above 35 or not, but also check the range in which it lies. Here is the formula that will give you the result in this case: =IF(B2<35,"F",If(B2<50,"D",If(B2<70,"C",If(B2<90,"B","A")))) This formula first checks if the score is less than 35 or not. If it is, then it returns F, else it moves on to the next condition, and so on. Example 3: Calculating Commissions Using Excel IF Function Excel If Function allows you to perform calculations in the value section. A good example of this is calculating the sales commission for sales rep using the IF function. In the example below, a sales rep gets no commission if the sales are less than 50K, gets a 4% commission if the sales are between 50-80K and 10% commission if the sales are more than 80K. Here is the formula used: =IF(B2<50,0,IF(B2<80,B2*4%,B2*10%)) In the formula used in the example above, the calculation is done within the IF function itself. When the sales value is between 50-100K, it returns B2*4%, which is the 4% commission based on the sales value. Example 4: Using AND/OR Operators in IF Function Within the IF function, you can use the AND/OR operators to check multiple conditions at a time. For example, suppose you have a list of students with their marks and attendance. Only those students get the scholarship who have a score of greater than 80 and attendance of more than 80%. You can quickly identify such students using the AND condition within the IF function. Here is the formula that will identify the students eligible for the scholarship. =IF(AND(B2>80,C2>80%),"Yes",”No”) It works by checking both the conditions in the AND function. If the AND function returns TRUE, the IF function returns “Yes”, else it returns “No”.

Courtesy Google  Google is bringing its new Express service to Alabama, giving residents another option for personal shopping for everything from toys to dry foods. The service works by a user logging on to Google Express' web page or opening the app, which is available for iPhone or Android phones. The web page and the app sync, so that users can access their up-to-date cart either way. Then store employees pick and package the order and work with another one of Google's delivery partners, which include FedEx and UPS, who then deliver either overnight or within two days. Google Express will not be delivering fresh or frozen food in Alabama. Google Express charges a membership fee - $99 for an annual membership - and then offers free delivery for orders that cost over a certain amount, usually between $15 and $35, depending on the store. The stores set their own prices on things purchased through Google Express, so sometimes items cost more than they would if the customer were doing the shopping. If you don't get the membership, there's a delivery fee that starts at $4.99.  "This last weekend, we had a kids' birthday party, plus yet another soccer game where we needed to bring snacks, so I can open the app Thursday for snacks and Toys'R'Us for a toy and have those products delivered to us, in this case, overnight," Google Express General Manager Brian Elliot said. "It's how we make it easier for people to shop from merchants they love." Wait times depend on customer location and the store itself, but it's next-day delivery or two-day delivery. Here's the full list of stores Google is currently working with in Alabama:  Costco Whole Foods Market Kohl's PetSmart Road Runner Sports Sur La Table Fry's Walgreens L'Occitane Payless ShoeSource Guitar Center Google is also launching in portions of Kentucky, Utah, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington on Tuesday. Elliot said that with this latest expansion Google Express is now available to 90 percent of the country's population. In some other markets, Google Express offers fresh food delivery and same-day delivery, but those will not be available in Alabama at launch.

Google i By John Murawski jmurawski@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Search engine powerhouse Google introduced its Google Express home-delivery shopping service in North Carolina on Tuesday in a disruptive bid to wrest market share from online retail giant Amazon. Google said Tuesday’s expansion of Google Express to more than a dozen states gives more than 90 percent of the country’s population access to the shopping service initially launched in 2013 as a digital experiment. Google Express customers can order online or through an app. “You can shop online, order from all those merchants, fill a single basket,” said Brian Elliott, general manager of Google Express. “Payments, checkout are all integrated and your products are delivered from those stores in one to two days.” Some 50 stores nationwide are participating in Google Express but only 11 are signed up for deliveries in North Carolina at this time. One of the stores, Costco, requires membership to process orders through Google Express. The others are Whole Foods Market, Walgreens, Kohl’s, PetSmart, Road Runner Sports, Sur La Table, Fry’s, L’Occitane, Payless ShoeSource and Guitar Center. Google’s business model is based on collecting sales commissions from the stores and charging user fees to customers. A single Google Express order costs $4.99, but customers can subscribe for $10 a month or $95 a year. Monthly and annual subscribers can make unlimited purchases, Elliott said, but will have to pay a $3 fee for orders under $15. Google does not disclose how many people have subscribed or use the service. Also, Google Express comes with restrictions. “We’re not doing refrigerated or frozen goods,” Elliott said. “And we’re not going to deliver a couch.” Initially, Google officials acknowledged that they were motivated to introduce Google Express because they noticed that shoppers were increasingly bypassing Google and searching for products directly through Amazon. Now they’re billing Google Express as a shopping experience. Neil Begley, a media and telecommunications analyst with Moody’s Investors Service, said it’s not likely that many households will pay a $99 subscription fee for Amazon Prime and also a $95 fee for Google Express. He noted that Amazon is already well established and offers a broader range of products. But Begley said Google’s strategy has been to penetrate systems and networks like a Trojan horse and then become embedded and ubiquitous. “Everything they do has multiple iterations of planning with long-term goals that aren’t easy to see,” Begley said. “It very rarely stops at that first dimension for them, like with other companies.” John Murawski: 919-829-8932, @johnmurawski Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:27 Elizabeth Warren to Wells Fargo CEO: 'You should resign' Pause 0:26 Nov. 14 supermoon is closest moon to Earth since 1948 0:48 Sunday Supper on Fayetteville from the air 0:56 UNC's Roy Williams will 'be damned' if he's going to emulate Duke 2:38 Meet Judge Mike Morgan, North Carolina's newest Supreme Court justice 5:14 McCrory: 'We're going to check everything' 2:32 Trump names Priebus chief of staff, other top advisors await appointments 0:31 Downtown Raleigh coffee shop 42 & Lawrence served coffee the Gilmore Girls way 1:09 68 Seconds of Dadgum Roy 3:36 Roy Williams’ Comments Following Win Over Chattanooga Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 13 days ago Gov.

October 25, 2016 WSP Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is ready to launch its Virtual Reality headset called the ‘Daydream View’ which matches perfectly with the Pixel line, Google’s first self-branded phones. However, rumor has it that the company will not stop there. The tech giant is reportedly working on a more advanced eye-tracking headset. Google joined the VR experience and introduced their first rather simplistic attempt with the Google Cardboard headset. However, Daydream View, which will take the basic ideas behind Cardboard a step further, is considered their biggest bid in trying to join the likes of Facebook’s Oculus, HTC, Intel, and Qualcomm. As mentioned, to make a better impact the device is made for pairing with the Pixel line of phones. With Samsung’s recent flop with their Galaxy Note 7 units, many are expecting for a shift towards Google’s flagship device. For customers who are still leaning towards Android phones, Google’s extremely fast Pixel should be placed high in consideration. Getting back to Google’s VR efforts, there are rumored to be around 50 developers who will be bringing their games and apps to Google’s Daydream before the year ends. According to the search giant, Daydream is set for release on November but a specific date has yet to be given. The device is priced at $79.00, inclusive of the motion-sensing controller. Apart from Daydream, Google is also reportedly working on a standalone VR headset that has the ability to map out the world around you. Rumors suggest that the next device might even be able to follow your vision thanks to an eye-tracking capability. The rumored VR headset, which is separate from the Daydream VR platform, will be completely standalone and will not connect for powering purposes to any device such as a PC or a smartphone. According to Engadget, this eye-tracking headset will be able to “blur the line between virtual and augmented reality” thanks to the technology and algorithms the company will include. Engadget also reports that in building the advanced device Google will partner with Movidius, a soon-to-be-Intel-purchased computer vision company which will provide Google processor chips that will aid in tracking motion and positional awareness. While Google and Movidius have remained silent on the rumor – a report said that a “wireless virtual reality” device passed through FFC’s for approval. The file revealed very little information about the gear but it can be noted that Google’s VR group director of product and management Mike Jazayeri is listed as contact. While the form of Google’s eye-tracking headset remains a blur, Microsoft and Magic Leap are trying to reach the same goal. Magic Leap actually named Google as one of their important investors, a hint which may lead others to assume that the company is really interested in advancing VR technology. If the rumors are proven to be true, Google’s wireless eye-tracking headset might just be the very first to insert reality into the virtual world.

Home News Virtual & Augmented Reality Google buys VR eye-tracking startup company In order to bolster its Daydream VR headset, Google has bought out a VR startup that specializes in eye-tracking tech By: Derek Strickland | Virtual & Augmented Reality News | Posted: Oct 25, 2016 12:47 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Google has purchased Eyefluence, a startup company that specializes in eye-tracking technology,     Google plans to fold Eyefluence's unique eye-tracking VR optics software tech into its new mobile-powered Daydream View VR headset. The software uses "vision-driven, intuitive eye-interaction" to discern quite a bit of information from users, chiefly whether or not HMD wearers are interested in what they're seeing or not. We're not 100% sure how Google will leverage Eyefluence to build a new optics solution for Daydream VR, but we could see some interesting convergences happen, including eye-controlled interfaces   "At Eyefluence, we are engineering the ability to transform intent into action through your eyes. Leveraging eye biomechanics and the eye-brain connection with the first-ever eye-interaction technology solution for HMD devices, we are expanding human potential and creating new possibilities in VR, AR, and MR worlds," reads the company's website.     "Today, we are excited to announce that the Eyefluence team is joining Google! With our forces combined, we will continue to advance eye-interaction technology to expand human potential and empathy on an even larger scale. We look forward to the life-changing innovations we'll create together!" Eyefluence wrote on a recent update.   Recommended for You I stepped into the shoes of John Wick and it was intense...

Here are the top five drawbacks that may weigh down on your pros and cons list.  ( Spencer Platt | Getty Images ) Advertisement The new Google Pixel and Pixel XL are all the rave right now. They're great smartphones, but they also have some drawbacks that may be deal breakers. We've compiled a list of the top 5 worst things about the Google Pixel and Pixel XL so you can make an informed decision, so here goes: 1. Google Pixel Price Google's latest smartphones are impressive and high-end, but they don't come cheap. The smaller Google Pixel starts out at $650 for the 32 GB model and goes up to $749 for the 128 GB version. The larger Pixel XL starts at $769 for the 32 GB variant and tops out at $869 for the 128 GB model. It's worthy of note here that the Google Pixels perfectly match the MSRP of the equivalent iPhone 7 variants. At the same time, it also means that the new Pixels may be out of the price range for many prospective customers, especially since Android smartphones from Google used to be more affordable under the Nexus line. 2. No Wireless Charging While the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL support fast charging, they don't support any kind of wireless charging. Having to do without this feature may be acceptable for a cheap midranger, but paying top dollar and not having wireless charging may be a deal-breaker for some prospective customers. 3. No Waterproofing / Water Resistance The latest Pixel and Pixel XL sport meager IP53 ratings, which means they can withstand contact with some solids but they'd best avoid any liquids. An IP53 certification is not really meant to handle water and while a small splash might be okay, there's no guarantee the handset will survive a heavy rain or a more consistent bath. At a time when flagship smartphones come with hefty dust and water resistance features, Google's oversight in this area doesn't bode well with the Pixels' high prices. On the other hand, although Google doesn't really make any waterproofing claims for the Pixel phones, recent videos from users who tested the Pixels' waterproofing seem to suggest a good resistance - the Google Pixel even survived one hour completely submerged underwater, suffering damage only to its speaker. 4. Only One Speaker Speaking of speaker, why do the Google Pixel and Pixel XL only have one, and why is it not better located? After the cool front speakers on the Nexus 6 from 2014 and Nexus 6P from 2015, having just one speaker on the latest Pixels seems like an injustice and its location below the display means you may often muffle it as you hold your smartphone one-handedly. 5. No Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) The Google Pixel and Pixel XL have electronic image stabilization (EIS), not OIS. That doesn't in any way mean that they can't capture quality shots - it just means that for those fixated on OIS, it may be good to know that it's not on the table. When it comes to the algorithmic video stabilization, meanwhile, it's quite impressive but it may also yield unstable results at times. Some videos, for instance, may feature increased digital noise and some issues with slow panning. Nevertheless, Google says that its Pixel smartphone snaps the best photos ever taken with a mobile device. Truth be told, photo samples do look pretty great. Other potential drawbacks of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL include no expandable storage, non-removable battery, semi-glass back, design that some find too iPhone-like, and the rebranding that tried to remove virtually any trace of HTC to leave only Google. On closer inspection, however, the pros may outweigh the cons and some may even find the new Google Pixels among the best smartphones to date. Are any of these drawbacks a deal-breaker for you? Do you have other Pixel disappointments we've not included here? Let us know in the comment section below. TAG Google, Google Pixel, Pixel XL © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

The Pixel XL smartphone with 32 gigabytes of storage has a total build of materials and manufacturing price of $285.75, according to technology component analysis firm IHS. With a retail price of $769, that means the margins on that particular model is about $483.25 per unit, excluding costs not accounted for by IHS. This exceeds Apple's profit on the 32 GB iPhone 7 with a smaller display, according to IHS's analysis. Google's margins on its first smartphone suggests that the Mountain View, California-based company not only wants Apple's user base, but its profits too. The Pixel is the start of a series of new products from Google parent Alphabet Inc., according to Rick Osterloh, the senior vice president in charge of hardware. The margins suggest that "Google is getting the same pricing for the same components as other tier one manufacturers of phones," said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking for IHS Markit. "They have as much pull as any of the big guys." This may not be a safe assumption, because Apple can order components in massive quantities, securing the lowest prices. Google can't make the same volume promises to suppliers, but the company's new hardware executives say they're aiming to accumulate such supply chain heft in the future. Jason Bremner, vice president of product management at Google, said last month that if suppliers know you're going to be around for years and ordering lots of components, they're more willing to work on new designs suited to your needs. One of the key features of the Pixel XL is its camera system, a single sensor module that takes 12 megapixel photos with the back camera and 8 megapixel shots with the front sensor. IHS estimates a total camera component cost in the Pixel XL of $17.50, which is less than the estimate of $19 for the iPhone 7's camera system, which has similar capabilities. The priciest component inside of the Pixel XL is its 5.5-inch AMOLED QHD display by Samsung Electronics Co., coming in at $58 per unit, according to the IHS analysis. At $50 per unit is Qualcomm Inc.'s Snapdragon system-on-a-chip, the brains of the device. Like Apple, Google has tapped NXP Inc. for the phone's near-field-communication payments chip and Samsung for storage. "All these different companies, not just Apple and Samsung, can make good hardware choices as hardware components have become commoditized," Rassweiler said. "The difference here is Google looking to integrate its hardware and software which Apple has specialized in for years."

While HTC has experience building its own phones, Google executives said they were responsible for the Pixel’s supply chain, design, and engineering. "I’d say it is likely that Google is very involved in the design of this; HTC in this case is really a provider just the way as Foxconn is to Apple," Rassweiler said.   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

This partnership will allow consumers to shop online with one tap, using fingerprint for authentication instead of username and password.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google has been rolling out new updates to Android Pay and the most notable of the recent additions include support for Visa Checkout and MasterCard's Masterpass, which was introduced Oct. 24. So what does this exactly mean for the average consumer? Well, to start with, the new credit card support will allow Android Pay users to go shopping in thousands of sites that support Visa Checkout and Masterpass using their fingerprint instead of providing a username and password. The entire process of buying an item or service has been boiled down to one single tap. In addition, online shopping payments also got more secure with the simplified but more effective authentication methods. All the user needs to do is link his or her Android Pay account to either Visa Checkout or Mastercard Masterpass. Google is also touting Android Pay's benefit for online merchants. The updated system allows merchants and developers to easily integrate the mobile payment system into their respective online stores. The tech company also cited how the Android Pay streamlined shopping experience could lead to better profit due to faster checkout times, fewer abandoned carts and higher conversions, among others. Clearly, Google is bearing down on its mobile payment system hard so it can lodge a credible challenge to Apple Pay, which has been enjoying unprecedented growth as of late. Android Pay adoption is currently dismal in comparison to Apple's payment tool. This is expected to change with the Visa and Mastercard partnerships. Unfortunately, it is not about to happen soon or during the holiday season. The agreement with the credit card companies will kick in the early part of 2017. Nonetheless, Visa and Mastercard's entry into the Android Pay universe is only part of a wider move to make Android Pay a universal payment system. Google has been working on partnerships that will propel it not just as a solution for online shopping but a tool for other financial transactions as well. Google is reportedly threshing out details of agreements with several banks to embed Android Pay within their own apps. For example, the payment tool will be used to withdraw cash from Bank of America ATMs soon. Previous software tweaks also underscore an increasing Android Pay sophistication as a payment system. Several recent API releases include one that can let users bypass all the conventional forms necessary during checkout such as forms asking for personal and shipping information. There is also an API called Save to Android Pay that will enroll customers in loyalty programs. Based on its initiatives, Google seems bent on approaching its Android Pay strategy by covering all front: consumers, merchants and financial services. It will not be surprising to find the system inextricably embedded in our future lives. TAG Google, Android Pay, Apple Pay, Visa, MasterCard © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

The Galaxy Note 7 line has officially been axed. What does it mean for Samsung and who could benefit from the fallout? Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 25, 2016 at 8:11AM With Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Galaxy Note 7 line being pulled from shelves, which consumer tech companies might benefit? Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) new Pixel phone looks like it could win over some burned Note 7 customers, but the search giant lacks meaningful carrier distribution. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA, discuss the fallout from the Note 7 recall and the smartphone market at-large. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016. Dylan Lewis: I've seen [Alphabet's] Google thrown around in the list of potential winners as well. The idea is kind of similar with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- they released the Pixel phone somewhat recently. Having a major potential competitor off the table bodes well for people giving that a shot. That's not going to be something that meaningfully contributes to the numbers for Google. I think, when you're talking about Apple and Google here, seeing Samsung falter and knowing that there might be a slightly larger bite of the smartphone market available to them isn't something that's thesis-altering. It's certainly interesting for some of the component manufacturers that are specifically in some of these devices and not others. But big picture, if you like Apple and Google already, stick with them. But don't buy solely on the idea that they might pick up some incremental business here. Evan Niu: Yeah. The Pixel looks like a pretty good phone. Of course, it's Google's first phone, they designed the whole thing. They're outsourcing manufacturing, naturally, to HTC. But as far as them designing the phone itself, this is the first time that they're really doing the whole thing. It looks like a really good phone. I think, definitely, people that are not getting the Note 7 might consider the Pixel, because it's a pure Google phone stock Android without all the third-party software and all this stuff on it. But I think the biggest challenge there in terms of getting people to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL or whatever the large one is called, it's really just about distribution. Google doesn't have distribution channels in the way that most companies in the space do. They're partnering with Verizon, which is the only carrier partner. Other than that, they're selling it online through the online store. But, it might surprise you how many people, when they need a new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the retail store. Lewis: It becomes kind of a default decision, right? Niu: Yeah. And it makes some sense, because that's where they have the most selection, they can deal with all their plan stuff. I personally tend to buy things online, and I think a lot of people do. But, carrier distribution is an incredibly important channel for any phone maker. People that already know which phone they want they'll just go and buy that phone online. But a lot of people don't know, and they still like to shop around, like any other product in their lives, versus people like you and me are probably so loyal that it's not even a decision, it's just, when am I going to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of people, their phone breaks, or it's time for an upgrade, they just go to the carrier store and pick one. For the other carriers other than Verizon, Pixel's not going to be there, because Google is distributing themselves. It's harder for Google to get these carrier relationships going, because the carriers want more control. It's harder for Google to negotiate because they've never been a big player in the physical smartphone space. So I think the biggest thing that's going to hold them back is their lack of distribution. Lewis: It sounds like the rundown for investors here is, Apple, Google, possible beneficiaries. The people that might really see some importance swings in what goes on with their numbers are some of the component manufacturers like you talked about, Taiwan Semiconductor. My feeling is, for Samsung's business, if they're able to keep the bad PR and negative brand association contained to the Note line, then this won't be something that's really awful for them long term. If it does start to bleed into the other products they offer, the S7 and things like that, it could spell trouble for their mobile segment for a long time. Niu: Yeah, the main thing is to figure out what the hell is going on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone next year and it has the same thing, that would thesis altering, two in a row. And, if they can't figure it out, there's reason to think that there might be another one. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of consumers want them to know exactly what's going on and tell the public. Then we might see a nice rally in Samsung sales. Niu: They can't replicate this in their labs! It's just crazy.

Unlike the Nexus, there’s no co-branding with LG or Huawei. Sure the phone’s box says manufactured by HTC, but it’s like how iPhones are made by Foxconn in China. Pixel and Pixel XL are a Google-only effort from top-to-bottom. The company is tying up with distributors in India to get this phone into offline retail stores as well. Google Pixel starts at Rs 57,000 going up to Rs 76,000. The phone highlights the best of Google: the Assistant, an excellent camera, unlimited storage for photos, and performance that’s top notch. So should Samsung be worried? Does the iPhone 7 have a challenger? We got the ‘Very Silver’ version of the larger Google Pixel XL, and here’s our review.

The 10 Best Android phones 2016 - which should you buy? By Stephen Lambrechts, Nick Broughall Mobile phones   The best Android handsets rated Shares The 10 Best Android Phones UPDATE: Plenty of changes on our best Android phones 2016 list with the addition of Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL and Motorola Moto Z – read on to find out more! Apple may have kickstarted the smartphone revolution when it launched its very first iPhone back in 2007, but it was Google's Android operating system that truly took it mainstream. With an open platform and multiple manufacturers using the operating system, Android was always destined for greatness. Today, Android is easily the biggest mobile OS in Australia. With only a couple of exceptions (thanks Nokia), all the companies that were making mobile phones before iOS was launched now run Android. Samsung, Sony, LG, HTC and Motorola all wave the Android flag proudly on their devices.  Google itself now has its own branded flagship phones in the Google Pixel and its big brother, Google Pixel XL. Still, the many variations in screen size, processing power, software features and design makes finding the best Android phone for you extremely tough. To help find the best Android phone for you, we've rounded up the best Android handsets out there today, rating the phones on hardware performance, OS upgrade potential and, of course, how shiny and nice they are to have and boast about to work colleagues. So here they are - the best Android phones money can buy today. For many, many different reasons. Prev Page 1 of 11 Next Prev Page 1 of 11 Next 10. OnePlus 3 Though OnePlus second handset, the conveniently named OnePlus 2, had its share of problems, the Chinese startup has proven that third time's the charm with its impressive follow-up, the OnePlus 3. Providing a premium smartphone experience without costing you an arm and a leg, the OnePlus boasts a Snapdragon 820 processor and a huge 6GB of RAM, ensuring that the OnePlus 3 will be available to keep up with its more pricey competitors. It's also got a improved photographic capabilities, with a 16MP rear camera and 8MP front camera, and it also runs on Android 6 Marshmallow. There are a few shortcomings, such as the lack of MicroSD storage expansion, and it's also a phone that has to be imported into Australia (the European version of the handset is the one featured on this list).  Because of this, not all Australian LTE bands are supported by the phone. You can find more detailed information about which bands are supported at Ausdroid. Read the full review: OnePlus 3 review Prev Page 2 of 11 Next Prev Page 2 of 11 Next 9. Sony Xperia Z5 Premium The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium is the first smartphone to boast a 4K resolution, and it makes the most of it with a large, not to mention absolutely stunning, 5.5-inch display. Beyond the screen it takes many of the best things about the standard Sony Xperia Z5, such as its brilliant 23MP camera, a water resistant build and an impressive fingerprint scanner. It's undeniably premium, but we're not big fans of the chunky design and all those pixels take a toll on the battery. If you want to wow your friends with an almost impossibly crisp screen the Z5 Premium will do the job and it's an impressive phone in most other ways too. Read the full review: Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Prev Page 3 of 11 Next Prev Page 3 of 11 Next 8. Sony Xperia XZ Sony has taken everything great about its last few smartphones and put them into one package for the Xperia XZ. It's waterproof, has a premium design, a beautiful display, incredible camera tech and the best battery life we've seen on a flagship Sony phone in some time. The 23MP sensor from the Xperia Z5 is still at play here, but it comes with a number of superior upgrades. The new autofocus means you can grab some incredible action shots that you'd struggle to recreate on any other smartphone. It's a pricey choice for your next smartphone, but the Xperia XZ is one of the best on the market right now so it may be worth spending a little to get your hands on it. Read the full review: Sony Xperia XZ Prev Page 4 of 11 Next Prev Page 4 of 11 Next 7. LG G5 With last year's leather-bound LG G4 failing to turn heads, LG went back to the drawing board with its follow-up, producing the highly customisable (and much more impressive) LG G5. Undoubtedly its most audacious smartphone shakeup yet, the LG G5 provides an entirely modular experience, allowing the user to customise their handset on the fly depending on the situation in which it's being used. That means you can add a DLSR-style grab with dedicated shutter buttons, a Hi-Fi DAC + Amp that radically transforms the quality of even your standard MP3s, and more. With an ever-expanding collection of accessories, or 'Friends' as LG calls them, you can pop the bottom of your phone out and attach a mod in a matter of seconds – each mod and accessory intended to give you more control and improve the quality of your experience with some of the G5's key functions. Add this some impressive performance, a wonderful new wide angle camera, a strong QHD screen and a rear fingerprint scanner, a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Kryo chipset and 4GB of RAM, and what you have is a strong contender for LG's best smartphone to date. Read the full review: LG G5 Prev Page 5 of 11 Next Prev Page 5 of 11 Next 6. Google Pixel XL The Google Pixel XL offers up a pure Android experience on a bigger, higher resolution display than its brother, the Pixel. The clean, slick interface is a joy to use, while the 12MP snapper round the back delivers some quality shots. A fingerprint scanner not only keeps the Pixel XL secure, it also uses gestures to give you easier access to the notification bar - saving you from over-stretching your thumb to the top of the screen. The price is on the steep side, but this is a premium flagship device and while we'd like the battery to be a bit better the XL is still an excellent smartphone. Read our full review: Google Pixel XL Prev Page 6 of 11 Next Prev Page 6 of 11 Next 5. HTC 10 HTC takes fifth place on our best Android phone list with the gorgeous HTC 10. If you're after a phone that will provide you with an incredible audio experience, the HTC 10 is tough to beat. The HTC 10 has a new design with but if you're a fan of the HTC look don't worry, it shares a lot of its design language with past HTC handsets. It has a 5.2-inch 2K display, which makes watching video gorgeous, as well as some strong spec under-the-hood including 4GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset. The camera technology is a big focus for HTC though. A 12MP sensor may not sound like much, but it makes some gorgeous images on the back and there's a 5MP front-facing camera to capture your selfies too. Read the full review: HTC 10 Prev Page 7 of 11 Next Prev Page 7 of 11 Next 4. Google Pixel If you're looking for the ultimate Android experience without any over-complicated features the Google Pixel is the phone for you. It takes the latest version of Google's software - Android 7.1 Nougat - in its natural form. There's no annoying third-party manufacturer overlay, it's Android as Google intended. Add to that its premium design (although the glass patch on the rear is a little questionable), excellent camera and huge amount of power under the hood and you've got yourself a rather special smartphone. The battery life is the weak point for the Pixel, and we'd recommend carrying a charger with you if you're out all day. Read our full review: Google Pixel Prev Page 8 of 11 Next Prev Page 8 of 11 Next 3. Motorola Moto Z The Moto Z is modular like the LG G5, but it's far better with extra add-ons and a much easier to use snap-on design. It's powerful and the modular design means you'll be able to switch out elements for future accessories, like mini projectors and audio boosters, and could mean you can keep this phone for much longer than other devices that will date faster. Usually when we talk about mid-cycle upgrades, we're strictly talking about new software. Moto Z could take on new form at any time. It may be the world's thinnest phone, but that comes at a cost with a reduction in battery size and the loss of the headphone jack – potential issues for some users. If you can overlook these shortcomings though you'll have a truly innovative device in your hands. Read the full review: Motorola Moto Z Prev Page 9 of 11 Next Prev Page 9 of 11 Next 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 Second place goes to the Samsung Galaxy S7. The Galaxy S6 was our favourite Android phone of 2015, but now the Galaxy S7 has improved on it in almost every way. There's a brand new waterproof design with a variety of little changes that make it much more comfortable to hold. It doesn't look as innovative as the Galaxy S7 Edge with its curved display, but this version is much more compact than the Galaxy S6 Edge+. The issues come in the high price and the fact there's only one storage version. But you can always buy a microSD card, up to 200GB, and get a bit of extra room. If you're looking for one of the best, high-end phones in the world right now - this Android is a great choice. Read the full review: Samsung Galaxy S7 Prev Page 10 of 11 Next Prev Page 10 of 11 Next 1. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge It has finally happened - the Edge version of a Samsung phone is now actually the best Android phone in the world. Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge expands on what the curved display from the Galaxy S6 Edge can do. It has found a happy medium at the 5.5-inch size as well as adding in a lot of new functionality for the most innovative screen tech in phones. The camera may look like it has dropped when you see it on the spec sheet - but in fact bringing it down to 12MP and updating the sensor technology has meant this is one of the best phone cameras out there. All in all, the Galaxy S7 Edge is an improvement on everything that went before it. Finally, Samsung has nailed the most interesting version of its phone and made the Galaxy S7 Edge the reigning champion of the phone game.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Google Pixel XL Manufacturing Cost is in Line with Rival Smartphones, IHS Markit Teardown Shows LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The cost to manufacture the Google Pixel phone closely matches that of its intended rivals—a logical and expected move, especially since Google’s new offering figures to target the same class of high-end users that normally flock to flagship smartphone models from Apple and Samsung. All told, the bill of materials (BOM) cost for the new Google Pixel XL 5.5-inch phone with 32 gigabytes (GB) of NAND flash memory comes to $278, according to a preliminary teardown estimate from IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions. After including $7.75 in basic manufacturing costs, the total cost to manufacture the Google Pixel XL rises to $285.75. With an unsubsidized price of $769, the direct manufacturing cost-to-sales-price ratio is in line with those of direct competitors in the smartphone market, such as the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. The Google Pixel is also available as a 5.0-inch model. “Total BOM costs for the Google Pixel XL are, not surprisingly, in line with those of other competitors, because the supply base and specs are very similar from phone to phone—whether it’s an iPhone, a Galaxy-series phone or the Google Pixel XL,” said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. “The Pixel clearly targets the same top-end flagship space occupied by the Apple iPhone and top-end Samsung Galaxy lines, with retail pricing points that directly compete with these products.” The Google Pixel may also have an advantage for now over counterparts offered by Android rival Samsung, given the permanent withdrawal from the market of the Galaxy Note 7 after manufacturing defects caused the phone’s batteries to explode. Hardware design “triples down” on Android “Google has long used its Nexus line to serve what it deems to be an exemplary demonstration of Android hardware design. Now, some eight years after the launch of the first version of Android, and with Apple iOS and Google Android settled as the dominant platforms, Google has ‘tripled down’ on Android by vertically integrating its smartphone design,” said Wayne Lam, principal analyst of smartphone electronics for IHS Markit. The Pixel is the first-ever phone by Google to carry the company’s famous brand name. “First, the Pixel is a big departure from the Nexus line of smartphones in that Google has now taken over all aspects of the hardware design and software integration,” Lam said. “Second, this vertical integration of hardware and software is a product strategy taken straight out of Apple’s playbook. And third, not only is Google through the Pixel directly competing with Apple, but also rivaling its own Android ecosystem partners in introducing new premium hardware to compete with the likes of Samsung, Huawei and LG.” Comfortable in its own skin The Pixel comes in two variants—the 5.0-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL—along with two memory capacities (32 and 128 GB). On top of the Google-designed hardware is the new Google Pixel launcher or “skin,” which imbues the smartphone with a user-experience design that is new and ostensibly more efficient than any original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-specific design available. For their part, existing OEMs have weighed down Android with their specific look and feel by creating bloated software that run on top of older Android versions. A premium on design Both the Pixel and Pixel XL feature an aluminum enclosure with active-matrix organic light-emitting-diode (AMOLED) displays, which also are utilized for Google’s Daydream virtual reality platform. Moreover, Google spared no expense in packing the Pixel designs with cutting-edge hardware configurations. Both Pixel models also come with 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM and Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 821 CAT-12 LTE modem design, supporting up to three-carrier aggregation and maximum theoretical download speeds of 600 megabits per second (Mbps). With the Pixel, Google is also signaling a design trend toward a complete Qualcomm system-on-chip (SoC) and radio frequency (RF) design; the Galaxy Note 7 featured the last such RF360 design. Best-in-class camera Another outstanding feature of the Pixel is the high-end mobile photography capabilities of its 12-megapixel camera, with a large 1.55-micrometers (μm) imaging pixel size. While the primary camera does not have optical image stabilization (OIS) in the module, an electronic OIS is provided through the sensor fusion that takes out video shakes via software. In fact, the Pixel’s camera is optimized to take advantage of the available hardware so that it compares favorably to the best camera phones available today from Apple and Samsung. Notable battery life, but lack of water resistance Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL sport battery ratings of 2,770 and 3,450 milliamp hours (mAh), respectively, for a very capable 13 to 14 hours of use time over 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) internet. The Pixel also leverages Qualcomm’s QuickCharge 3.0 technology, embedded in the Snapdragon chipset, providing seven hours of use with just 15 minutes of charging. But similar to versions of the Nexus, Google’s previous phone offering, the Pixel does not include wireless charging functionality. More surprisingly, however, Google neglected to include a water-resistant enclosure design on the Pixel. In contrast, the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 both have IP67 or higher ratings to protect those phones against both dust and liquids.

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161025005551/en/ Google Pixel XL Exploded View (Graphic: IHS Markit) All told, the bill of materials (BOM) cost for the new Google Pixel XL 5.5-inch phone with 32 gigabytes (GB) of NAND flash memory comes to $278, according to a preliminary teardown estimate from IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions. After including $7.75 in basic manufacturing costs, the total cost to manufacture the Google Pixel XL rises to $285.75. With an unsubsidized price of $769, the direct manufacturing cost-to-sales-price ratio is in line with those of direct competitors in the smartphone market, such as the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. The Google Pixel is also available as a 5.0-inch model. "Total BOM costs for the Google Pixel XL are, not surprisingly, in line with those of other competitors, because the supply base and specs are very similar from phone to phone-whether it's an iPhone, a Galaxy-series phone or the Google Pixel XL," said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. "The Pixel clearly targets the same top-end flagship space occupied by the Apple iPhone and top-end Samsung Galaxy lines, with retail pricing points that directly compete with these products." The Google Pixel may also have an advantage for now over counterparts offered by Android rival Samsung, given the permanent withdrawal from the market of the Galaxy Note 7 after manufacturing defects caused the phone's batteries to explode. Hardware design "triples down" on Android "Google has long used its Nexus line to serve what it deems to be an exemplary demonstration of Android hardware design. Now, some eight years after the launch of the first version of Android, and with Apple iOS and Google Android settled as the dominant platforms, Google has 'tripled down' on Android by vertically integrating its smartphone design," said Wayne Lam, principal analyst of smartphone electronics for IHS Markit. The Pixel is the first-ever phone by Google to carry the company's famous brand name. "First, the Pixel is a big departure from the Nexus line of smartphones in that Google has now taken over all aspects of the hardware design and software integration," Lam said. "Second, this vertical integration of hardware and software is a product strategy taken straight out of Apple's playbook. And third, not only is Google through the Pixel directly competing with Apple, but also rivaling its own Android ecosystem partners in introducing new premium hardware to compete with the likes of Samsung, Huawei and LG." Comfortable in its own skin The Pixel comes in two variants-the 5.0-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL-along with two memory capacities (32 and 128 GB). On top of the Google-designed hardware is the new Google Pixel launcher or "skin," which imbues the smartphone with a user-experience design that is new and ostensibly more efficient than any original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-specific design available. For their part, existing OEMs have weighed down Android with their specific look and feel by creating bloated software that run on top of older Android versions. A premium on design Both the Pixel and Pixel XL feature an aluminum enclosure with active-matrix organic light-emitting-diode (AMOLED) displays, which also are utilized for Google's Daydream virtual reality platform. Moreover, Google spared no expense in packing the Pixel designs with cutting-edge hardware configurations. Both Pixel models also come with 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM and Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 CAT-12 LTE modem design, supporting up to three-carrier aggregation and maximum theoretical download speeds of 600 megabits per second (Mbps). With the Pixel, Google is also signaling a design trend toward a complete Qualcomm system-on-chip (SoC) and radio frequency (RF) design; the Galaxy Note 7 featured the last such RF360 design. Best-in-class camera Another outstanding feature of the Pixel is the high-end mobile photography capabilities of its 12-megapixel camera, with a large 1.55-micrometers (µm) imaging pixel size. While the primary camera does not have optical image stabilization (OIS) in the module, an electronic OIS is provided through the sensor fusion that takes out video shakes via software. In fact, the Pixel's camera is optimized to take advantage of the available hardware so that it compares favorably to the best camera phones available today from Apple and Samsung. Notable battery life, but lack of water resistance Google's Pixel and Pixel XL sport battery ratings of 2,770 and 3,450 milliamp hours (mAh), respectively, for a very capable 13 to 14 hours of use time over 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) internet. The Pixel also leverages Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 technology, embedded in the Snapdragon chipset, providing seven hours of use with just 15 minutes of charging. But similar to versions of the Nexus, Google's previous phone offering, the Pixel does not include wireless charging functionality. More surprisingly, however, Google neglected to include a water-resistant enclosure design on the Pixel. In contrast, the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 both have IP67 or higher ratings to protect those phones against both dust and liquids.

(Photo by Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images) Amazon, Cloud Computing, Connectivity, Featured, IBM, Internet of Things, Microsoft, Networking, Rackspace Hosting, Security Cloud Giants Likely to Beef Up Bandwidth to Fight IoT Botnets by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on October 25, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet Amazon and IBM appear to be the only major cloud infrastructure providers to have been affected by the DDoS attack of potentially unprecedented scale on DNS servers operated by Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn last week. While it’s unclear exactly why the other providers, such as Microsoft, Google, and Rackspace, didn’t suffer service disruptions (the most likely reason is that they don’t use Dyn), companies whose computing and storage infrastructure underpins so many of the top internet services will have to take a hard look at their existing DDoS mitigation strategies. Attributed at least in part to a piece of open source software that enables attackers to use poorly secured connected devices – such as some CCTV cameras and DVRs – the series of attacks on Dyn last week shows that it will be difficult to predict just how big future attacks may be and how much bandwidth headroom companies will need to maintain in their networks to fight IoT botnets. “In the past month, we’ve seen a doubling of the largest DDoS attacks,” Lawrence Orans, research VP at Gartner, told Data Center Knowledge in an interview. “I think the infrastructure providers are going go be looking for ways to beef up their DDoS mitigation” capabilities. See also: Hackers Take Down Sites From New York to LA in Web-Host Siege The scale of DDoS attacks is typically measured in Gigabits per second, since they work by flooding target networks with enough requests to exhaust their bandwidth resources. Before last September’s attack on the website of cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, the size of the largest known attack had been 363 Gbps. The attack on KrebsOnSecurity.com was close to 620 Gbps, Krebs wrote. That attack, however, was quickly followed by an attack on the French hosting company OVH, which was “roughly twice the size of the assault on KrebsOnSecurity,” according to Krebs. Dyn has not yet disclosed the size of the multi-stage attack on its infrastructure on October 21st. As of Monday afternoon, the company was still busy conducting root-cause analysis of the incident and expected to have more details to report by the middle of the week, its spokesman, Adam Coughlin, wrote in an email to DCK. “At this point we know this was a sophisticated, highly distributed attack involving 10s of millions of IP addresses,” Kyle York, Dyn’s chief strategy officer, wrote in a statement posted on the company’s website over the weekend. Tens of millions of discrete IP addresses used in the attack were associated with Mirai, the software that automatically detects poorly secured IoT devices and enlists them into a botnet used to conduct a massive-scale DDoS attack.

The second attack, which was more global in nature, caused similar impact on AWS users hosting applications in Amazon data centers in Ireland. There was a third attack that day, according to Dyn, but the company was able to prevent it from affecting customers. A summary of the incident is posted on the AWS Service Health Dashboard. An Amazon spokesperson pointed us to the summary in response to a request for comment. The company didn’t point to Dyn specifically, saying only that the errors resolving DNS hostnames for some AWS endpoints were caused by an “availability event” with one of its third-party DNS service providers. AWS uses several such providers, in addition to its own DNS service called Amazon Route53. Asked why other cloud providers managed to avoid being hit last week, a spokesperson for the cybersecurity and intelligence firm Flashpoint said it was “because AWS is the only major cloud provider that heavily relies on Dyn for its infrastructure services.” Microsoft and Google cloud status dashboards did not show any disruptions during the attacks on Dyn. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment, while a Google spokesperson said there had been no Google Cloud Platform disruptions in connection with the incident. IBM PaaS Users Affected IBM, it appears, is another provider that relies on Dyn for at least one of its cloud services. Depending on who you ask, IBM is or isn’t one of the top cloud providers. While it has an extensive cloud services business, its cloud revenue doesn’t come close to the amount of money AWS reels in each quarter, which often causes it to be excluded from discussions about top cloud providers. Users of Bluemix, IBM’s Cloud Foundry-based Platform-as-a-Service, experienced DNS resolution issues in Australia, US, and Europe within the timeframe of the attack on Dyn, according to updates on the Bluemix System Status dashboard. One of the updates pointed to Dyn’s website for details on the incident. The health dashboard for IBM’s Watson IoT service does not list any issues for October 21. SoftLayer, IBM’s IaaS cloud, doesn’t offer a status dashboard for non-customers. An IBM spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Rackspace Sticks to DDoS Best Practices Rackspace, another Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud provider, also was not directly affected by the attacks. “Of course, as customers of companies that leverage Dyn, our customers and Rackers alike experienced degraded connectivity and/or weren’t able to access many prominent websites on Friday,” a Rackspace spokesperson wrote in an email. Because there was no direct impact on its infrastructure, Rackspace is not planning to take any extra measures specifically in the incident’s aftermath, she said. The company conducts regular bandwidth assessments and upgrades to ensure it can withstand DDoS attacks. “As a best practice for potential DDoS attacks, we leverage global redundancy, high bandwidth, and both internal and external mitigation systems to protect Rackspace’s infrastructure and our ability to provide authoritative DNS services to customers.” How to Fight IoT Botnets? But extra measures will most likely be needed, as connected devices continue to proliferate, offering hackers a way to build DDoS botnets of unprecedented scale. Armed with these IoT botnets, bad actors can inflict ever more damage and launch attacks at a higher rate than before, Gartner’s Orans warned. Nothing suggests that an attack on Dyn today couldn’t be followed by an attack on UltraDNS or another service provider tomorrow, he said. Cloud companies and others who provide internet infrastructure services will have to invest in more bandwidth, DDoS mitigation equipment, and expertise to address new attack capabilities, Orans said. “That’s what they need to do to mitigate impact from these types of attacks.” Previous Article Rackspace Boosts International Team, Opens Munich Office Next Article When is a Cloud Not a Cloud?

Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: October 26, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Well, it is official now, the Nexus brand is being sent off into a retirement exile. It is going to be replaced by the latest Pixel smartphones from Google. It is nothing short of trauma for ardent Nexus fans to see their favourite brand being discontinued. As of yet, Pixel has not yet been given the status of Nexus’s legitimate successor. It was shortly after that that we realized there is indeed a proper upgrade for the Nexus 6P. However, it is not called a Nexus, but a ZTE. It has been developed by a China-based manufacturer, into a brand-new phone by the name of Axon 7. This new device deserves its title of the next Nexus 6p because it comes packed with features that are Google-exclusive. It even runs on the leading hardware. The icing on the cake being, that the gadget is pocket-friendly too, which is not the case with the highly-priced Pixel sets. The Axon 7 consists of a 5.5” QHD screen, and it is powered by the Snapdragon 820 SoC. It also has 6GB of RAM. The device is completely supported by Google Daydream VR and it is on the verge of receiving the Android 7.0 Nougat update. With so many features on offer, the Axon 7, slightly embalms the pain of not getting another Nexus device released. The Axon 7 is supposedly good enough to take over from the Nexus 6P. Google may not tag the handset as a Nexus, but that does not stop us from seeing it as a Nexus. The Pixel and Pixel XL, which were formerly called the HTC Nexus Sailfish and Marlin, are smartphones by Google that the tech giant has finally released out of the door. However, it seems that the company is not finished, as also part of the year’s bonanza from the company, includes a tablet. Christened as the new Google Nexus 7, the device may have a recycled name but it carries serious features that potential customers might find appealing. Debatably, the most prominent speculations of the times are that Google is dumping the Android operating system for Andromeda, which is the cross between Chrome and Android within one software. It is eagerly expected and awaited by tech enthusiasts that Google to unveil its Google Nexus/Pixel 2016 tablet at its October launch event. This is also where it launched its new smartphones under the pixel brand, the Pixel, and Pixel XL. Unfortunately, no such thing happened. Hence, next gen speculation about the Google Nexus/Pixel 2016 tablet release date, specs and price details are still unconfirmed officially. If the word on the street is to be believed, then there still are chances that Google might run next-gen tablet before 2016 comes to an end. As Google, has wiped out the Nexus brand in smartphones and switched to the new brand called Pixel, speculations suggest that the upcoming tablet will also get rolled out under the Pixel brand. In fact, popular leaker Evan Blass had previously tweeted that the forthcoming Google Nexus/Pixel 7 2016 tablet will boast 4 GB of RAM and will get an announcement date in 2016. The tweet also said Huawei will be making the next gen tablet. In the specs department of the Google Nexus/Pixel 2016 tablet, the next-gen tablet is reported to come out with Google’s latest Andromeda operating system. The OS is a mixture of Android 7.0 Nougat and Chrome. Hopefully, Andromeda will bring in some spice to the new features on the tablet.

The team of researchers behind the machine is also using the images in an experiment designed to find the root of horror. The DeepDream algorithm transfers a photograph of the Eiffel Tower in Paris to a horror scene, in a style called 'Fright Night', according to the website. 'We use state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to learn how haunted houses, or toxic cities look like,' the researchers said This GIF shows how the DeepDream algorithm transfers a photograph of the Eiffel Tower in Paris to a horror scene in a style called 'Fright Night' © MIT   NIGHTMARE MACHINE Scientists at MIT have developed a system that is trying to find the scariest image out there.

New York city after an alien invasion, according to the Google Deep Dream algorithm, is pictured HOW DEEP DREAM WORKS  Google trains an artificial neural network by showing it millions of training examples and gradually adjusting the network parameters until it gives the classifications the team want. The network typically consists of 10 to 30 stacked layers of artificial neurons and each image is fed into the input layer, which then talks to the next layer, until eventually the 'output' layer is reached. The network's 'answer' comes from this final output layer. In doing this, the software builds up a idea of what it thinks an object looked like.  In the 'generative adversarial network,' part of the network will attempt to fool the other part by inventing fake data, which will be mistaken for training data.  The Nightmare Machine team is making photographs of famous landmarks appear scary. The two main techniques used in the project, style transfer and generative adversarial networks, were published in papers last year.

Each time someone votes for an image as scary, the algorithms learn to consider the qualities of that image as fear-inducing qualities - and the same goes for non-scary' images. Every time a vote is cast, the AI learns more about what humans consider a scary image. With enough input from people around the world, the AI could generate the sum of human fears. TURN YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS INTO DEEP DREAM NIGHTMARES  Last year, Google gave a glimpse into how its Deep Dream networks learns to recognise photos. The results were a terrifying and fascinating mix of random animals, eyes and psychedelic shapes spotted in everyday images. And a few weeks later, developers created an app that lets you transform your own photos and GIFs into Deep Dream nightmares. Called Deep Dreamer, the tool was built by Realmac Software based in Brighton and is only available for Mac users. The company specialises in Mac software and has not revealed plans to roll it our for Windows user.  Any photo or GIF can be dragged into the tool, or opened from the File menu, and a series of tools lets users tweak how the finished photo, or ‘dream’ will look. These range from an impressionist painting style, to looking for eyes, animals and a dream described simply as ‘trippy’. The number of ‘dreams’ and iterations can be tweaked to dig deeper into the image and Google’s code, resulting in more obscure and surreal images. Once the refinements have been selected, users click ‘Start dreaming’ and the image begins to change on the screen. A progress bar sits at the top and a notification is sent when the ‘dream has finished’. Last year, Google gave a glimpse into how its Deep Dream networks learns to recognise photos.
