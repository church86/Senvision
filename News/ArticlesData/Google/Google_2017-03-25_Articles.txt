So it makes sense that over the past few years Google has added some touchscreen-friendly features to Chrome OS, like an on-screen keyboard for typing without touching a physical keyboard. Now Google is rolling out the stable version of Chrome OS 57, and it includes a few more tablet-friendly features… although not all tablet-style Chromebooks are getting the update right away. Among other things, Chrome OS changes what happens when you press the power button. Previously, pressing the power button would lock the device and show the lock screen. Now it puts a Chromebook to sleep. That might seem like a small change, but it’s an important one: if you’re using a Chromebook in laptop mode you can put it to sleep by closing the lid. But if you’re holding a tablet that might not be an option. Right now most tablet-style Chromebooks feature built-in keyboards that fold back behind the screen when they’re not in use. But this paves the way for Chromebooks with detachable keyboards or Chrome OS tablets with no keyboards at all. For now, it’s nice to know that you can keep a convertible Chromebook in tablet mode without flipping the screen just to put the device to sleep. Another tablet-friendly feature is an updated Camera app feature that adjusts the UI depending on whether you’re using a front or rear camera. Not only is this useful for tablets or other devices with dual cameras, but it can also be used on some of the education-oriented Chromebooks that have a single camera that can tilt to face the keyboard side of a laptop, or face away. Other changes include support for PIN unlock on all Chromebooks, an updated boot animation and updated default wallpaper, and support for silent authentication. While some of the most useful updates in Chrome 57 apply to convertible tablet-style devices, it’s interesting to note that a handful of Chromebooks won’t receive the over-the-air update just yet, and those models include convertible models such as the Asus Chromebook Flip C100PA, Asus Chromebook Flip C302, Acer Chromebook R13, and Samsung Chromebook Plus.

It cost a little more than an iPad now cost as Apple is now trying to compete on price and dropped the iPad to $350 but does not change our decision.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Tuesday, March 28, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 15336 79 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

Digital Trends Home > Wearables > Movado’s Connect smartwatches start at $495… Movado’s Connect smartwatches start at $495, ship with Android Wear 2.0 By Julian Chokkattu — March 24, 2017 1:26 PM Subscribe Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you 2017 is bringing a lot of options for Android Wear enthusiasts. Movado is the latest watchmaker to partner with Google. While we already know Swarovski will announce an Android Wear smartwatch “for her” at Baselworld 2017, Movado just announced a slew of other devices at the annual watch and jewelry trade show. These devices won’t launch until the fall 2017. Qualcomm hinted early this year that more and more Android Wear smartwatches are on the way, and what better place for them to be unveiled than at one of the largest watch trade shows in the world? Movado’s Android Wear lineup has been designed for version 2.0 of Google’s smartwatch operating system, which launched on the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style in February. The new version is expected to roll out to a handful of current smartwatches over the coming months. More: LG Watch Sport (Android Wear 2.0) review Movado Connect is the name of the watchmaker’s Android Wear 2.0 lineup of smartwatches, and there will be five men’s styles “with a starting price of $495.” These smartwatches will be available in the United States, the Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company said smartwatches under the Movado Connect brand will feature “five unique customizable dials” that will each also have three to four customizable elements — such as backgrounds, watch hands, and complications. Complications are like widgets that sit on the watch face, offering a shortcut and a brief glance into specific apps, such as your calendar or fitness activity. It seems as though Movado will offer further customization of these dials than what’s currently possible on other Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches.

Google Assistant, which was introduced in Wear 2.0, will also be present. The watchmaker said the devices will have an always-on display, round screens, improved fitness tracking (which is likely the Google Fit improvements introduced in Wear 2.0), and iOS and Android compatibility. Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss are also two brands in the Movado Group that are also partnering will Google to introduce new devices in the fall of 2017, though nothing specific was mentioned.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google retires SMS support in Hangouts, axes… Google retires SMS support in Hangouts, axes experimental Gmail features By Kyle Wiggers — March 24, 2017 1:38 PM Subscribe Share TopRank Marketing / Flickr Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you use Hangouts to send and receive SMS messages, it's time to switch: Google is doing away with support soon. At the Google’s HQ in San Francisco, it’s that time of year again: Spring cleaning. On Friday, Google detailed features that will be going away in the coming weeks as part of the company’s perennial efforts toward “streamlining” its products. First to get the ax is text message support in Google’s Hangouts messaging app. In the next few weeks, holdouts will get a Hangouts notification to switch to another app. And starting on May 22, Hangouts will cease to send and receive carrier SMS messages. More: Attack on Slack: Google beefs up its Hangouts services, meet and chat Google is suggesting that users migrate to its text-focused Android Messages app. “We want to provide a consistent and easy-to-use SMS experience for Android users right out of the box,” a spokesperson said. “We’re focusing on making Android Messages the primary place to access SMS and are working with carriers and device manufacturers to include Android Messages natively in Android devices.” Google notes that the shutdown won’t impact Google Voice users and Google Fi subscribers who use Hangouts for messaging. It has published a helpful resource with more information. Meanwhile, Google Talk — the precursor to Hangouts — is shutting down entirely. Google said it will prompt Gmail users who haven’t switched to Hangouts to do so, and that the legacy Google Talk Android app, which Google replaced with Hangouts in 2013, will stop functioning by late April. More: Hangouts may lose SMS support as Google overhauls it to take on Slack Google is also retiring a few features in Labs, mail service’s experimental collection of apps and settings. Authentication Icons, which identified verified (i.e., legitimate) senders with a “key” icon, are going the way of the dodo. So will the Google Voice Player, which provided an audio preview of incoming voice mails. The next to go are previews of Picasa photos and chat pictures; Quick Links, which provided fast access to emails and folders; the ability to quote selected text;  Smart Labels, which automatically categorized newsletters, promotions, receipts, and notifications; and Yelp review snippets. Finally, Google is retiring Google+ functionality in Gmail. Beginning sometime in April, you’ll no longer be able to email Google+ profiles or use Google+ Circles. More: Google launches business-friendly video-calling version of Hangouts called Meet Canning old products and features — even popular ones — is nothing new for Google. In 2013, the Mountain View giant caused a minor uproar when it shut down Google Reader, an web service that consolidated articles from around the web. And it shut down Google Flu Vaccine Finder, a mapping app that showed nearby vaccination places across the United States, in 2012. Still, the shutdowns will no doubt catch some users by surprise, but Google is pledging to minimize the disruption wherever possible. “We realize these updates may be an inconvenience,” a spokesperson said. “These updates will help us to focus and prioritize features that will improve the entire G Suite user experience for everyone.”
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google is reportedly working on a new social app… Google is reportedly working on a new social app for photo editing and sharing By Christian de Looper — March 24, 2017 4:14 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Google's apps are a little hit-and-miss -- but if it's good, the next big photo app could allow you to share and edit photos with your friends. Google is working on yet another app. One of the company’s most-loved apps is Google Photos and it offers excellent options for photo editing, storing, and sharing — but it looks like Photos isn’t the only photo-based app Google is concerned with. Reports indicate that the company working on another app, this time specifically for photo editing and sharing. Why? Well, it could be because of the pressure posed by the other large tech companies. Facebook, for example, offers Moments — and Google’s new app could be similar. The news comes from a TechCrunch report, which notes that the app allows groups to edit photos together, then organize them. More: Google announces updates for Duo, Allo, Photos, and Google Search in Brazil In another report, from Engadget, a Google spokesperson noted that the new app is just an experiment — so it’s possible it may not even see the light of day. In fact, Google doesn’t currently have launch plans, although that could, of course, change. It’s important to note that reports indicate this won’t just be “another messaging app.” Rather, it will be aimed at collaborative photo editing — along with a splash of Google’s computer expertise. Reports also note that the new app sounds very similar to Paths, an app that gained popularity for offering small groups of friends to share photos and chat. At the time, it acted kind of like a counterbalance to the more open sharing that had gained popularity on Facebook and Twitter. Incidentally, Google previously tried to buy Path. In the end, however, it was sold to Kakao, a Korean messaging giant, and its popularity has slowly but surely shrunk. It will be interesting to see what Google’s new app ends up looking like if we ever see it at all. Google has a spotty history in social media, after all. It’s also possible that the features in the new app will end up being baked into Google Photos. We’ll just have to wait and see.

The cars of Google Street View, fitted state-of-the-art methane analyzers and sensors are tracking the gas. The project is deemed far effective than the conventional detection systems.   ( Christopher Furlong | Getty Image ) Advertisement The drive to detect methane leaks has been underway in the U.S. cities. With Google Street View mapping cars giving the lead, fitted with state-of-the-art methane analyzers and sensors scouring gas leaks beneath the urban centers. The mission has been spearheaded by researchers at Colorado State University (CSU) in association with the Environment Defense Fund and Google Earth Outreach. The cars are fitted with infrared laser methane analyzers that detect the methane concentration in the air while algorithms compute the methane leaks and the size of such underground emissions. The data is being monitored by researchers at the Colorado State University. According to lead researcher and CSU associate professor of biology Joe von Fischer, the effort will pre-empt any labor-intensive steps in the future to measure out methane leaks from the distribution chain. The project's intent is to help the government and utility companies to prioritize leak repairs by addressing the top 8 percent of leaks to slash methane emissions from pipelines by 30 percent. Mapping Methane Leaks More Effective Meanwhile, the mapping exercise at the leaking natural gas pipelines with Google Street View cars has been found far more effective than conventional leak detection efforts. The Google Street View cars drove from street to street with methane analyzers collecting air samples to measure the concentration of methane. In New York state, the Google cars drove around Boston, Indianapolis, Staten Island, and Syracuse. Maps were made from the methane data for algorithms to pinpoint locations where underground pipes are leaking. Boston Among Worst Affected So far the worst affected areas have been found to be Boston, Staten Island, and Syracuse, where old cast iron distribution pipes are existing. At Burlington and Indianapolis replacement of pipes with corrosion-resistant materials made a positive change with methane levels found to be 25 times lower than per kilometer of road. The mapping has estimated that the largest 8 percent of leaking pipes are in Boston, Staten Island, and Syracuse. If they are repaired on a priority, the overall reduction in methane emissions from leaks will be 30 percent. California Methane Leak Southern California faced the hazards of methane leak in the last quarter of 2016 after utility officials detected the underground pipe leak in late October. The leak was reported by the Southern California Gas Co. Thousands of families were evacuated following the methane emissions. It was described as an "environmental disaster" by the Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, and two schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District had to be closed. The methane leak was a jolt to California Gov. Jerry Brown's efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. More than 72,000 metric tons of methane have leaked, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. "Methane is in a category of greenhouse gasses known as short-lived climate pollutants," suggested a note on the website of California's Air Resources Board. Thousands of residents from the Porter Ranch community had to relocate after complaining of nausea and other problems.

Release of Samsung Galaxy S8: Will Samsung make it a game changer? Sun, 2017-03-26 11:37  editor United Kingdom Hemantha Abeywardena writes from London… After a flurry of rumours, leaks and guesses that have been running for months, Samsung Galaxy S8 is going to be released on Wednesday, according to Samsung, the tech giant, while stirring up the excitement of millions of its fans, most, if not all, may have had a bruising experience last year, if they bought the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 Samsung suffered a double whammy of the arrest of its Group Chief, Jay Y Lee, having been under the spotlight for months over a corruption scandal and the exploding Galaxy Note 7 disaster last year. It lost billions of dollars due to the latter, which left a significant dent on its global reputation; the poor PR handling made things worse for Samsung, when the problem could have been nipped in the bud with an honest admission and timely product recall. In this context, Samsung may have used all the resources at its disposal to get this big event right for obvious reasons. Since all major phone manufactures are focussing on improving the usual features such as the screen resolution, display size of the phone, the features of the phone and the size of memory, Samsung may introduce something unique in order to stay way ahead of the pack. The speculation was rife that Samsung may introduce a versatile AI – artificial intelligence – assistant to rival the existing ones – Apple’s Siri, Google’s OK Google and Windows Cortana. Samsung confirmed that it was the case recently by naming the AI assistant, Bixby; whether Bixby is going to outsmart its peers, remains to be seen, though. Samsung phones became a serious rival to Apple’s iPhone while using Google’s Android operating system. Since over 80% of global mobile phones are using Android phones, the place of Samsung among the very users is secure despite the Note 7 debacle. Things, however, changed last year. With the sleek, eye-catching designs and cutting-edge technologies to match them, Samsung has been winning the hearts and minds of Android phone users for years. During the Note 7 calamity, most users opted for Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, when they needed a new phone, in spite of a looming uncertainty over the next smartphone by Samsung. When my iPhone 6 stopped functioning, I turned to Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, while bringing my loyalty to Apple to an abrupt end. The combination of its gorgeous appearance with curved display and amazing camera doesn’t let me contemplate on an alternative at present. If Galaxy S8 goes beyond the usual, evolutionary changes, millions of users in my position will be attracted to the new product in the offing. Samsung made a monumental mistake by expediting the launch of Note 7, perhaps, to take on Apple iPhone 7, when Apple’s flagship product saw its sales falling for two successive quarters. It didn’t work; nor did it hurt Apple. This time around, Samsung appeared to have learned the lesson; there is no rush on Samsung’s part to release the new phone. It took time, may have done the homework properly and placed the necessary mechanism in place not to make the same blunder this year again. If Samsung comes up with a revolutionary change, mobile phone users will forgive the company for the infamous mistake and start flocking towards the star product in no time. - Asian Tribune - Tweet Login or register to post comments News Headlines SDGs should not be the icing on business-as-usual 'cake' People Demand Sampanthan’s Resignation The TULF deman Hong Kong elects China-backed first female leader Carrie Lam as chief executive!

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 26 March 2017 | MYT 12:00 PM Iranian immigrant rose to building Google’s business, leading Twitter’s board Success story: Kordestani at the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco. The Iranian-born businessman grew up in San Jose, California, and was Google's chief business officer before moving to Twitter in 2015. — Bay Area News Group/TNS SAN FRANCISCO: Follow someone you know. That's how Twitter executive chairman Omid Kordestani, like many immigrants, found his way from Iran to Silicon Valley as a teenager.  The move was unexpected. So was his father's death from cancer, a moment of grief that left his family with a decision about where to go next. And as luck would have it, Kordestani followed family friends to the United States in the 1970s just as turmoil broke out in Iran.  "My immigration was total serendipity," he said in an interview at Twitter's San Francisco headquarters.  Kordestani's trials as an immigrant and his success in Silicon Valley help illustrate why the tech industry has reacted so strongly to President Donald Trump's travel ban. Immigrants in the Bay Area have founded companies, served as executives and helped create the technology of the future.  An immigrant's journey to a new country is rarely as simple as following a relative or friend. But Kordestani's challenges also shaped his success in Silicon Valley, including more than a decade at Google, where he joined the tech firm as employee number 11 and led the company's global business operations.  He once told a graduating class at San Jose State University – his alma mater – to "think and act like an immigrant."  "What I mean by that immigrant attitude is that you've got to continually fight, challenge yourself," said Kordestani, who is now a US citizen. "You've got to make yourself uncomfortable so you grow from that."  At 53 years old, he's still tackling new challenges at Twitter, a tech firm that raked in US$2.5bil (RM11.06bil) in revenue in 2016, but posted a loss of US$457mil (RM2.02bil). Trump's tweeting has raised Twitter's profile around the world, yet the company still struggles to compete for ad dollars amid layoffs and executive departures.  Trump's recently revised executive order, though blocked in court, continues to bring more attention to how immigration fuelled Silicon Valley's growth. It's also placed more pressure on Twitter's leaders, who have faced calls from critics to bar the president from the social network for what they deem as hate speech and misinformation.  While Kordestani opposes the travel ban, he's also an optimist who firmly believes in the power of dialogue that Twitter enables.  "Achieving the success he has achieved has allowed him to have a very optimistic view of the world – that hard work and persistence will pay off in the end – and he brings that to every meeting and challenge," said Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's general counsel.  When Kordestani reflects on his childhood in Tehran, Iran, he describes a metropolis filled with different cultures and religions living together in harmony.  His mom was a nurse. His dad, an engineer, built a three-story apartment that the middle-class family called home. Americans lived on one floor. Israelis lived on another. His dance instructor was Armenian.  Attending Andisheh Don Bosco School, an Italian Catholic school in Tehran, Kordestani studied in English and Farsi.  But when his father died, Kordestani knew there would be more opportunities to study engineering outside of Iran. Getting admitted into a university in Iran is highly competitive, and there are only a limited number of spots for students.  At 14 years old, Kordestani envisioned life in America would be like the sitcom The Jeffersons. The country was filled with opportunity, as conveyed by the show's Movin' On Up theme song.  "It was an African-American family living in Manhattan," Kordestani said. "It just seemed like this incredible dazzling city to me, and I imagined the entire United States looked like that."  Two choices were on the table: San Jose, where his father's boss had sons attending school, or Fort Worth, Texas.  "I think California has better weather. We should go there," his mom said at the time.  In 1978, Kordestani, his younger brother and mom packed their bags for San Jose. The harmonious Iran of his youth soon became a distant memory.  After graduating from San Jose State University in 1984 with a degree in electrical and electronics engineering, Kordestani took a job at Hewlett-Packard as a product marketing manager.  Around that time, he also became a naturalised US citizen. That allowed him to bring back his mom, who had left the country because she didn't have a green card.  After five years at HP, Kordestani wanted another challenge, so he earned a master's degree in business administration from Stanford University and went on to work for a number of Silicon Valley startups.  He joined Google in 1999, and employees who worked with him said he instilled confidence during the company's rapid growth.  Colleagues joked that Kordestani was "sandbagging," or tempering expectations to make Google's financial results look better. So he once stood on a sandbag to read quarterly forecasts and targets.  "It shows his ability to laugh at himself and his ability to create strong cultures that really set the company up for success," said Jeff Levick, who had served as Google's vice president of industry development and marketing for the Americas region. Levick is now an executive in residence at Greylock Partners.  But at the peak of Kordestani's career success, fame and fortune at Google, he also found himself in the office of a psychologist in San Francisco, going through a divorce with his wife Bita Daryabari and questioning if he should be happy with all he accomplished.  In 2008, Forbes valued Kordestani's net worth at US$2.2bil (RM9.73bil). After his divorce, Forbes assessed his net worth in 2009 at US$1.4bil (RM6.19bil).  Speaking in 2009 at a leadership conference at UCLA, organised by two Iranian-American groups, Kordestani said that "life is messy," but urged the audience not to be afraid of failure. When life surprises you, he told the crowd, checklists and the Persian life manual go out the window.  In 2011, Kordestani, who has two older children with Daryabari, got married again. His current wife, Gisel, used to work at Google and is the co-founder and chief operating officer of political fundraising site Crowdpac.  "Sometimes you think people like Omid are perfect and untouchable. He showed the real human side of struggle and shared it, and I think that was valiant," Gisel Kordestani said of the speech her husband gave in 2009.  He has two young children with Gisel, who was born and raised in France but has English parents. The couple speak French, English and Farsi to their children.  Kordestani has a contagious laugh, like several of his colleagues and friends whom he's known for 30 or 40 years, his wife said.  "I make fun of him because when he's telling a joke, he usually starts laughing as he's telling the punch line," she said.  On an alumni wall of honour filled with black and gold plaques at San Jose State University, an etching of a smiling Kordestani stands out among other notable engineering graduates.  When students pack that room to receive scholarships, Belle Wei, an SJSU professor and former dean of the college of engineering, often points to Kordestani's plaque as she encourages them to follow their own dreams.  "If you work hard, you're in the right place and doing the right thing," she tells the students, "then one day you can be like Omid." — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Pre-orders for Sony Xperia XZs and XA1 start today Chinese court rules in favour of Apple in local design patent disputes Intel tries to fire up high-end PC demand with new memory chips Digi spearheads digital learning trend among employees Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

That day Hamilton finished second as well, leaving the odd man out from the podium that day one podium wonder Vitaly Petrov. He’s got 19 races to go to win the title (Vettel that is, don’t fancy Petrov’s chances) and the next step will be the Chinese Grand Prix in a fortnight.

Lap 57 - Vettel gets around the final lap unscathed to win in Australia. The grandstand rises to applaud as he crosses the line to win in Australia. Advantage Ferrari in 2017. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.30am EDT 02:30 Lap 56 - It’s 10.5 seconds for Vettel. Now Verstappen is asking his garage what the fastest lap is so he can have a go, and they sensibly reply “too fast”. At the same time Bottas, then Raikkonen nab the new fastest lap. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.28am EDT 02:28 Lap 55 - Looks like our top five is set now. 1) Vettel 2) Hamilton 3) Bottas 4) Raikkonen 5) Verstappen With Massa the only other man on the lead lap. Meanwhile Kvyat has been asked to nurse the car through to the end, and responded by asking who now had the fastest lap and what it was. That’s the sort of devil may care attitude the new owners of F1 will love. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.27am EDT 02:27 Lap 54 - Verstappen can still see Raikkonen in front of him, going around roughly 1.3 seconds behind him for the entire lap. He’s probably too far away now, losing time in the early turns of the next lap. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.26am EDT 02:26 Lap 53 - Vettel puts an exclamation mark on his day by nicking the fastest lap from Kvyat immediately. Meanwhile Alonso has retired, leaving the battle for 10th to Ocon and Hulkenberg. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.25am EDT 02:25 Lap 52 - It’s all red at the front, with Vettel merrily going about his business with a comfortable lead. Doesn’t look like much chance of a Bottas attack on Hamilton now. Kvyat has just set the fastest lap of the race. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.23am EDT 02:23 Lap 51 - The battle for the last point has become a three-way fight, with Alonso in front of Ocon and now with Hulkenberg preying on them as well. Ocon goes in front! Hulkenberg nicks past Alonso as well. Confirmed suspension failure for Magnussen. Roll the ‘Haas of Pain’ headlines. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.22am EDT 02:22 Lap 50 - Kevin Magnussen retires, and surprisingly Kvyat comes into the pits. He had the last scheduled stop, and now what we expect is the last unscheduled one. The gap at the front is 8.4, and a further 1.9 from Hamilton to Bottas. The top six are all on the first lap, ending with Massa. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.20am EDT 02:20 Lap 49 - It might not be all over for the Hamilton vs Bottas contest yet. The gap is back down to two seconds. Surely you don’t have a go at the star performer in your first day on the job. Hope he does though. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.19am EDT 02:19 Lap 48 - Looks like Bottas is comfortable for a podium finish here. Hamilton continues to motor around roughly seven seconds behind the leader. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.17am EDT 02:17 Lap 47 - Vettel has 1st covered, Hamilton has survived the Bottas challenge, and Verstappen hasn’t got into a position to have a go at Raikkonen yet. We’re in a holding pattern with 10 laps left. In the battle for 10th Esteban Ocon is right on the tail of Alonso in the McLaren for what would be his first career point. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.15am EDT 02:15 Lap 46 - Only bad luck or inattention can cost Vettel now. And I don’t fancy there’s any danger of the latter. Hamilton’s now got 2.5 seconds on Bottas and looks to be successfully turning back that challenge. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.14am EDT 02:14 Lap 45 - Hamilton reports his power is dropping in and out. Meanwhile Verstappen is - as Australians would say - “fanging it” in his quest to catch Raikkonen. The gap is now less than two seconds. Kvyat has gone past Sainz into eight and is now looking at Perez. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.12am EDT 02:12 Lap 44 - Verstappen is 2.2 behind Raikkonen in the battle for fourth. The only teams with two cars in the top 10 are Ferrari, Mercedes and Toro Rosso. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.11am EDT 02:11 Lap 43 - Bottas is within 1.5 seconds now, and the grandstand finish for second is on. Meanwhile Lance Stroll’s debut is over. Fortunately he ends in the pits rather than around the track so he’s not subject to endless puns about his surname. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.10am EDT 02:10 Lap 42 - All eyes are on the Mercedes battle now. Vettel seemingly has this race won, we’re all just hoping that the teammates end up in close proximity. Meanwhile Lance Stroll takes a run down an exit road, then a detour across the kitty litter.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.55am EDT 01:55 Lap 32 - If you’re not a Mercedes fan it’s hard to argue Paul’s point here.

The new Nokia and BlackBerry phones shown at Mobile World Congress rely heavily on nostalgia and are aimed at niche markets; will that be enough to pull customers away from Apple, Samsung and the other big makers? PUBLISHED : Sunday, 26 March, 2017, 8:32am UPDATED : Sunday, 26 March, 2017, 8:32am Comments:   Ben Sin ben.sin@scmp.com Share PrintEmail Related topics Nokia Smartphones BlackBerry Related Articles Lifestyle Promise of 5G future dominates Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 4 Mar 2017 Tech New Nokia 6 unlikely to be a hit in China 12 Jan 2017 Apps & Gaming Nokia invests in women’s menstrual cycle tracking app 30 Nov 2016 It’s hard to imagine now, with the Apple iPhone and the array of Samsung models around the globe, that there once was a time when Nokia and BlackBerry were kings of the mobile phone industry. Finnish company Nokia made some of the first mobile phones in the 1980s, helped these devices become household items in the early 2000s, and by 2007, had a whopping 41 per cent of the mobile handset market. Meanwhile, BlackBerry, the brainchild of Canadian company Research in Motion, dominated the enterprise market, becoming a status symbol among working professionals. At its peak in 2009, it made an annual profit of US$2 billion and had a 20 per cent market share. We all know what happened next. Neither company took the iPhone, with its iOS platform, seriously when it was introduced in 2007, and within five years their kingdoms had fallen to the iPhone and phones using Google’s Android. The indestructible Nokia 3310 is back, complete with Snake, retro styling and epic battery life By the time Nokia and BlackBerry stopped making phones, in 2014 and 2016 respectively (the former was first sold to Microsoft and later passed to Finnish start-up HMD Global, while BlackBerry became the property of Chinese company TCL), the brands had been irrelevant for so long, no one but the most hardcore of mobile geeks cared – and even that was out of pure nostalgia. And so, when new BlackBerry and Nokia handsets were announced at this year’s Mobile World Congress, neither fans of the brands nor the media were sure what to expect. After all, both brands crashed and burned badly due to their repeated inability to understand mobile trends in the early 2010s, and the industry has only become more competitive since then, so can they make a real splash? Not at the highest level, no. No one can objectively say the five new handsets (four Nokias and one from BlackBerry) introduced at the Mobile World Congress are going to do much damage to Samsung and Apple phone sales – not with their modest specs and solid but unspectacular hardware – but all five phones do have specific features that cater to niche audiences. Plus, nostalgia is a powerful emotion, and both brands are designed to conjure up plenty of that among fans. BlackBerry’s KEYOne, for example, is a clear continuation of the once mighty portable work machines, a mostly black aluminium device with a physical keyboard attached to a modest 4.5-inch 1080P display. The problem is that few consumers today are clamouring for a physical keyboard, and the KEYone also runs on an underpowered Snapdragon 625 processor – a far cry from the Snapdragon 835 that will feature in Samsung’s Galaxy S8. TCL’s chief executive officer, Nicolas Zibell, says in defence: “We must stop thinking of the smartphone user experience as being driven by chipset power alone. In the same way that automobile makers select a certain engine to be optimised for an overall experience in a vehicle, the processor in a smartphone must be taken into context with the overall design and user value proposition.” HMD Global, meanwhile, introduced three new Nokia-branded devices running pure stock Android (which is usually only available on Google’s own line of phones, since brands such as Samsung and Huawei put their own software on top of Android), and a fourth device that drew most of the attention: an “updated” version of the iconic Nokia 3310. “Nokia has much brand equity and emotional resonance,” says Pekka Rantala, a former Nokia executive and now HMD Global’s chief mobile marketing officer, pointing out that the Nokia was likely the first mobile phone for many consumers. The market demands more than just a one-size-fits-all solution Nicolas Zibell He says the response to the 3310 has been “tremendous”. No one is denying the retro gadget is fun to look at and play with, but the device – true to its original roots – can only make phone calls, send SMS messages and play the mobile game “Snake”. You can’t go on Facebook and you can’t send e-mails. That doesn’t sound like a phone that many will actually want to use in a real-world situation. Rantala, of course, spins it like this: “The new 3310 is a great weekend phone for those who want to detox from social media.” At least the new Nokia smartphones get the software (stock Android) right. Rantala says HMD Global’s goal going forward is to release “well crafted” smartphones that work closely with Google to provide the most up-to-date software, security updates, and Google services. “We will work closely with Google to align our phones with their vision,” he says, “because Google services are the best services.” But here’s the thing: HMD Global is also aiming at the Chinese market – the Nokia 6, the new release with the best specs, was actually introduced in China before the Mobile World Congress – where Google services are banned. So how is HMD Global going to market Nokia phones as devices with the best Google apps when none of them can get over the Great Firewall? “I don’t have an answer for your question,” Rantala says. “But I believe that our partnership with Google opens up the opportunity to perhaps work things out with China.” Nokia’s comeback phone in China gets a collective yawn from buyers That’s a pipe dream. Chinese consumers are likely to stick with cheap local brands like Xiaomi, or “premium” phones from Huawei or Apple, rather than pay mid-tier prices for a Nokia or BlackBerry. A more realistic scenario for both brands is to appeal to the niche and emerging markets. According to research firm IDC, a disproportionate number of people in Indonesia are still using the long-abandoned BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) service, a fact Zibell is keen to explore. “The market demands more than just a one-size-fits-all solution,” he says. Why a BlackBerry needs a keyboard - head of China’s TCL talks up new smartphone at CES 2017 tech show Another senior BlackBerry executive concedes the brand doesn’t have lofty goals for now. Speaking to TechCrunch at the Mobile World Congress, BlackBerry’s mobile division general manager Bruce Walpole said if even one in eight consumers pick up the new BlackBerry, the company would be satisfied. Perhaps having the backing of a billion-dollar Chinese conglomerate (TCL owns another phone brand, Alcatel, and also makes smart televisions) takes a lot of pressure off the brand. HMD Global, however, doesn’t have that luxury. The company is small compared with other phone makers, and put together by a group of Finns. To them, the success of the Nokia brand isn’t just about making money or even restoring Nokia’s legacy, it’s about bringing pride back to the country. “Nokia was once the pride and joy of Finland,” Rantala says. “We want to bring the brand back to show the world why Finland was once the mobile capital of the world.” The early response to the classic Nokia 3310 has been strong (less so for the other models).

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube -- an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than 2 million other third-party websites.

Coinciding with today's announcement, it's also released its first Developer Preview, offering those who create software for the platform an early glimpse of what to expect in the coming months. Google said that "the O Developer Preview includes an updated SDK with system images for testing on the official Android Emulator". The company has also launched a new Developer Preview site with resources on the new edition, along with information on behavior changes and new APIs in the OS. This first Developer Preview will be supported on six devices: Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel C Pixel Pixel XL Google emphasizes - in more than one place - that "Developer Preview 1 is for developers only and not intended for daily or consumer use." Those who plan to install it are urged to read the release notes before doing so. A consumer beta will be released "as we get closer to a final product".

According to a report from TechCrunch, it seems that Google has some kind of group photo editing app that they are working on. Google has since confirmed the existence of the app, but apparently they claim that this is merely an experiment and one of many that they are running. This means that there is no guarantee that the app will be released, but from what TechCrunch is reporting, it sounds rather interesting as it is an app that allows small groups edit photos together. They have described it as being an app like Path meets Snapchat-style filters meets Google photo editing smarts. So far image editing apps have been largely a single-user experience, so it will be interesting to see what a group/social image editing app will be like, but presumably it will be collaborative in nature. No word on when (or if) the app will launch, but we’ll be keeping our eyes peeled for more information. Perhaps we might learn more at Google I/O in May, so stay tuned for more updates in the future.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Google Talk Will Be Shutting Down, Integrated Into Hangouts By Tyler Lee on 03/25/2017 17:49 PDT It seems that in addition to Google killing off SMS integration with Hangouts, there will be additional services that Google will be sunsetting, and one of those is Google Talk. However all is not lost because while Google Talk will be shutting down, Google has announced that it will be integrated into Hangouts instead, so there is always that option if you’re interested. In an announcement on its blog, Google has confirmed that Google Talk will be saying its goodbyes. According to Google, “Talk users within Gmail will receive a prompt in the next few weeks, inviting them to switch to Hangouts. After June 26, users will be automatically transitioned to Hangouts, unless contractual commitments apply. For users that preferred the Google Talk look, there is a Dense Roster setting in Hangouts that provides a similar experience.” For those who are unfamiliar with Google Talk, if you’ve ever used Gmail you might have noticed that you will be able to hold conversations with some of your contacts within the Gmail window itself, which is basically Google Talk. Users of Hangouts know that those conversations can carry on within Hangouts itself, so essentially the feature is being removed from within Gmail. We suppose there is some appeal to Google Talk as it allows users to chat while having Gmail open, which might be handy if you’re at work and don’t want your boss to see you chatting. It also saves users from having to open another tab or window, but we guess for now users will just have to start getting used to using Hangouts instead. Filed in General.

Abhijit Ahaskar With Android O, Google is trying to limit the activities of background apps even when you are working on other apps in the foreground. Google has released a developer preview called O for the next version of Android. What the O will be finally named will be decided later this year when the new OS and the new Pixel smartphones will be released. The developer preview provides app developers an early look into the features of the new OS so they can test and validate their apps for the new OS. This allows them to make their apps ready by the time new OS is available to consumers. Google will provide more details on the upcoming OS at the Google I/O Conference in May 2017. Here are some of the key features of the upcoming Android OS. Better battery Battery backup has been at the top of Google’s agenda since last couple of years. With Doze and Doze 2.0, they have been able to minimize battery drain caused by background activities. However, this worked only when the phone was not being used. With Android O, Google is trying to limit the activities of background apps even when you are working on other apps in the foreground. Apps in the background will be updated or synced less frequently. If a user is busy and can’t check a notification right away but doesn’t want to miss it either, they can snooze a notification to show up after a few minutes again. Smarter notifications With Android N, Google made notifications panel more interactive. And, with Android O, they have taken it a step further. Users can club their notifications into channels. So all notifications from news apps will show up together under news and all notifications from social media apps will show separately under social media. User can fine tune their notifications further by creating categories within these channels. Also, if a user is busy and can’t check a notification right away but doesn’t want to miss it either, they can snooze a notification to show up after a few minutes again. Superior audio The new OS will require some hardware upgrades from phonemakers too, as far as new phones are concerned. Android O will support advanced Bluetooth audio codecs such as Sony’s LDAC codec. It enables transmission of three times more audio data compared to audio transmitted through standard Bluetooth audio codecs. This means smartphones with Android O will be able to stream higher quality audio even during Bluetooth streaming. Wireless connectivity made better Another notable feature that could be seen in Android O is Wi-Fi Aware. Also known as Neighbour Awareness Networking (NAN), this technology allows users to connect and communicate with other users in their vicinity over a secure wireless network. This will allow users to chat with each others over messengers, send and receive files and even challenge each other in two player games without requiring an internet connection. More options on lockscreen This option to access an app from the lockscreen itself is very popular with users. In phones running stock Android UI, shortcuts are limited to camera or phone call. A lot of custom UIs allow users more options such as access to Facebook or Google Maps first thing after the lockscreen. With Google O uses can customise the lockscreen shortcuts and add more options and the ones that they actually want. With Android O, users can superimpose a new shape or design over the app icons. New look icons The idea behind stock Android is to keep things lighter, but at times the interface looks too bland. With Android O, users can superimpose a new shape or design over the app icons. User can choose the shapes and even add some animations when they interact with the apps. This will give the interface a more symmetrical and lively look. Better cache management Android O will allocate a fixed amount of storage space for every app’s cached data. When a user clears cached data in the phone’s settings, cached data of those apps will be deleted first that have exceeded their limit. The system will also delete the oldest cache files first.

I'll let you into a little secret though: Most of the time, I'm not doing anything all that impressive or magical. Troubleshooting basic computer problems is actually pretty straightforward. Picture: KJBevan/Shutterstock That's not to belittle the excellent work of genuine computer repair professionals — or to say that every problem is a simple one — but there are some basic steps you can work through before getting someone else in to take a look. Here's how to tackle it yourself. And, yes, I will still come and reinstall Windows for you in return for a couple of beers. Google well Neighbours and relatives have gratefully given me actual money for coming to their house and Googling their computer problems for them. It's not a cop out — it's a really helpful way of working out what's going wrong. That said, you need to be as specific as you possibly can in your queries and cut through the masses of results you're likely to get back. Chances are, someone has suffered the same issue as you, and probably found a fix too. Ignore sponsored results and links selling software and concentrate on forum posts or (even better) official sources from the software and hardware companies involved. Is there a fix you can download? Or a guide you can follow? If you're coming across a lot of different results and potential solutions, look for ones that users confirm have worked, or which have been approved by official sources. Most major software and hardware firms now have useful online troubleshooting tools, so hunt down those too — they may not always appear in your search results. Rebooting is cliche for a reason It's the most obvious cliche out there, but there's some truth in it, like most cliches — it even works for Boeing Dreamliners. Reboot your computer, your printer, your router, your mobile phone, your USB hub and everything else you're having a problem with. By reboot, we mean turn it off, wait a good minute or two, and turn it back on. Why does it work so well? It clears out all of the temporary (and potential dodgy) information from the memories of your different bits of hardware and forces them to start from scratch, whether that's connecting to Wi-Fi or loading a game. It also closes down apps or bits of code that shouldn't really be running. Some applications handle reboots better than others, but it's always best to go through the official shutdown and reboot process for your OS rather than pulling the plug (unless you have no choice) — it gives programs chance to save your work and do whatever housekeeping needs to be done before they start up again with a clean slate. Reinstall and update your applications Rebooting clears out the temporary gunk hanging around in your computer's memory but it won't affect anything permanently written to disk: Corrupt setting files, damaged data that should have been trashed but hasn't, and other bits of digital detritus will still be hanging around. An app reinstall can help fix that, and you should give it a try if one program in particular is proving problematic. Uninstalling and reinstalling an application not only clears out any corrupt data or broken settings, it also ensures you're running the latest version of the software, complete with the latest compatibility updates and bug fixes (assuming you get it from the web). Drivers and firmware aren't as important as they once were on computer systems but they're still worth a mention: Check in with manufacturer websites to see if any code updates are available for your graphics card, printer or other hardware components, particularly if there's one bit of kit that's giving you trouble. Check for spyware and malware If you're still having problems with system crashes and general sluggishness, a spyware or malware program may have taken root on your machine. Update your antivirus and antispyware software to the latest versions and run the most comprehensive scans they has. We've previously looked at the best choices. The more sophisticated types of malware out there know what an antivirus program looks like and will guard against attack or reinstall themselves once you reboot. Standalone scanners, like Microsoft Safety Scanner or McAfee Stinger, can sometimes get around this and excise particularly nasty infections. It's also worth checking up on the programs running in the background while your computer is on. Launch Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor on Mac to look for anything suspicious (there's no shame in running a web search for any entries you don't understand to check if they should be there or not). Do some simple investigating Some simple detective work can do wonders for finding solutions to PC problems. It's not always possible, but if you're having trouble with one bit of hardware, try replacing it with another: If it works, you've identified the source of the issue and can take appropriate action (like buying a new keyboard). There are plenty of useful, free diagnostics tools out there to lend a hand. DiskCheckup (Windows) and Onyx (Mac) can scan your hard drive for errors and clean up certain problems, while the much-loved CCleaner (Windows or Mac) is great for tidying up temporary files that shouldn't be hanging around. Dell has a variety of diagnostics programs you can use to try and get a better handle on what the problem is, while Windows has its own troubleshooter tool in the Action Center. If you're on an Apple computer you can run the integrated Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics depending on the age of your machine. Reinstall your operating system We've talked about emptying your computer's memory and cleaning up data files, and reinstalling Windows or Mac OS is the ultimate version of that. In the past, this used to be a long-winded and potentially dangerous process, but Apple and Microsoft have now made it so straightforward that it's almost worth doing regularly whether you're having problems or not. It's like a factory reset for your phone: Your computer will go back to being as it was when you first bought it. That means broken files, corrupt data, dodgy extensions and any viruses (except the most low-level and persistent ones) will be wiped away. So will all your documents, photos, emails, apps and settings too, so make sure you have everything safely backed up. You'll need to check the official instructions for whatever OS you have installed, but if you're running the latest versions of Windows or Mac OS X then it's not a complicated process. In both cases you can choose to try resetting the system files without touching your own data before going for a full reinstall. What's next? This is a cheatsheet for basic troubleshooting, not a catch-all for every problem out there. If something serious is going on — like a failing hard drive or a persistent virus — then calling in the help of a professional is a good idea. It's worth checking what kind of warranty and support options are offered by whoever sold you the computer as a first port of call. And, if you still can, back everything up. This is something you should be doing anyway, but most people don't think about it until their laptop or desktop dies. You can eventually replace your computer (even if you have to save up for a while), but precious photos and important documents are less easy to get back again.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION A consistent UI between your phone and this car makes perfect sense John Brandon@jmbrandonbb March 25, 2017 5:00 PM Tags: connected cars, transportation, VW Beetle Dune Image Credit: VW Technology can be a wild beast. Anyone who lives and breathes tech knows the rules are always changing. One day a certain smartphone, say the Google Pixel, is the coolest thing ever, the next you find out everyone has moved on to some other Android model. You try a new travel website that uses machine learning to find the best deals, and then you realize there’s a new app for your tablet that works much better. Driving today is equally variable. Climb into a Ford Escape and you’ll see an interface that’s been upgraded from the one the car had a few years ago. (Thankfully, it’s much better.) And if you switch between a few different cars for test drives at a dealership, there’s a good chance you’ll get confused about how to perform simple tasks, like syncing your phone over Bluetooth. That’s why, on a recent test of the 2017 VW Beetle Dune, it became clear how important a consistent interface is for the modern digital age. The car itself is fantastic — it uses a lower profile and has fine accents along the trim that are a throwback to the days of the original Southern California version. But what impressed me most is that once I hooked up my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone over USB, the interface for Android Auto popped up immediately. I’ve tested Apple CarPlay many times, but I had forgotten how slick Android Auto is. There’s a simple row of icons at the bottom. (You don’t even need to bother setting up Bluetooth, although that’s the only way to do a hands-free phone call.) You select a map icon — one for your phone and one for music. In the center, there’s a button you can use to access the Google Assistant, although in my tests it was obviously a simplified version. Mostly, the voice assistant helps you get directions. You can ask questions, but we’re not talking about the bot in the Google Home speaker here. In response to most of my test questions, the Android Auto bot kept saying it could not help with that. Those same questions lead to a much better result on Google Home. That said, the feature is not as distracting in the car. If you ask about pizza or seafood, for example, the bot will likely show a list of local eateries. The interface is clean and tidy, just like the one on the phone. I didn’t have to learn anything. In Google Maps, I already knew where to find the option to do a search. Even the voice was familiar. In Google Music, I picked an option to see my most recently played tracks. It’s slick because it is exactly the same as you see on the phone itself, which can help prevent distracting driving. You can plug in, punch in a song you want, get directions, and focus on driving. It’s worth noting that this is a good match for the Beetle Dune for another reason. The car is designed for having fun when you drive and for taking corners fast. It’s mostly about style, as well — the car is incredibly eye-catching, so much so that people kept asking about it when I parked. Since the focus is on driving and style, using Android Auto meant I didn’t have to learn how to use any of the dashboard options. There’s no adaptive cruise control or steering aids. Overall, the interface helped me focus on what was important — that is, making sure I put the turbocharged engine through its paces on some curvy roads.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Saturday 25 March 2017 20.05 EDT The internet celebrated its 28th birthday a fortnight ago. It’s an invention that ranks alongside the wheel, immunisation against disease and the internal combustion engine as a transformer of human existence. As an open information digital connector, it is an extraordinary force for individual liberation, embodying the very best of Enlightenment values: more information is available to more people through their mobile phones and personal computers than ever before. The world can then follow the Enlightenment injunction to dare to know to a degree that the great philosophers, arguing for a free public realm where information and evidence could be openly marshalled and tested for human betterment, could never have foreseen. Over the last 18 months, it has become obvious that the internet is the most serious threat to the Enlightenment values it purports to represent. As Tim Berners-Lee, the web’s inventor, wrote in a salutary open letter to mark its birthday, these are worrying times. The combination of losing control of our personal data, the monumental growth of misinformation and fake news and evolution of abusive, targeted “programmatic” advertising, particularly political advertising, constitutes a mortal threat to our civilisation. There is a new capacity to manipulate opinion and control our lives by companies, governments and political parties that makes Orwell’s warnings seem tame. Trump in the US and Brexit in Europe, events possibly influenced by the new disregard for fact and capacity to manipulate, are but storm warnings of where these trends are taking us. How we spend money, formulate ideas and cast votes are manipulatable and controllable as never before. In the UK, the government has taken powers to survey and monitor our emails and texts. In the private sector, Facebook and Google know more about our preferences, which can be shamelessly exploited by political and commercial advertisers. Worse, on Wednesday, as the government triggers article 50, we are set to leave one of the great sources of countervailing power and digital protection – the European Union. This will be presented as “liberation” by Leavers: rather, it is a moment of enthralment, when Britain weakens its capacity to combine with others to fight for Enlightenment freedoms against the digital behemoths that would dismantle them. One battleground became more vivid last week – the struggle to create a level playing field between information producers, such as publishers and newspapers, and those making fortunes, such as Facebook and Google, by making content available online. The law has developed to balance publishing freedoms with necessary responsibilities. Even most libertarians accept that publishing freedoms should not extend to incitements to murder, race hatred or violence. Equally, defamation and libel law tries to protect against the dissemination of falsehood and lies. Publishers and newspapers spend a great deal of money on getting their facts right to comply with the law. Readers have come to trust that what they read will have been rigorously screened to be true. The founding principle of the open worldwide web is that it is open. The great claim of Google and Facebook is that they are not publishers, but intermediaries and search engines that use this system to make universal digital wares produced by others. They have built an infrastructure to house data and refresh web pages in unthinkable volumes – Facebook has 1.9bn users, more than a quarter of humanity – to which advertisers are flocking. They are phenomenally profitable – Facebook’s revenues in the last three months of 2016 were $8.8bn – and they organise their affairs to pay as little tax as possible. Facebook sells advertising by enabling users to read what newspapers have published; newspapers lose the advertising revenue but still must comply with the law. The internet companies’ claim, supported by US law, is that they are conduits for information and are not publishers subject to the expensive business of ensuring that what their users access is true, non-defamatory and does not incite civilisation-damaging behaviour. It is bunkum. Worse, the advertising draining from newspapers is reaching such a scale that the viability of a free press is under threat. Online newspapers can charge subscribers, but still need advertising to support journalism and the expensive edifice of complying with publishing law. At the very least, as upholders of true news, they should be competing with Google and Facebook on equal terms. Last week, Google, owner of YouTube, had to accept that it has publishing responsibilities, a landmark moment. Advertisers were not prepared to see their ads alongside videos celebrating terrorism and Google, faced with a mounting strike from clients, acknowledged that it would have to police its videos and ads more rigorously. Meanwhile, the German government, with the EU commission, is preparing to fine social networking sites up to $50m if they fail to take down fake news, hate speech and defamatory content within 24 hours of it being posted. German competition authorities are taking Facebook to court for issuing blanket, incomprehensible consumer agreements that mean users have to cede all rights over their personal data. The EU commission has confirmed that it is considering whether the approach to harvesting personal data breaches EU anti-trust rules and the EU’s data protection directive, coming into force next year, has given every EU citizen the right to ensure their data is not abused. It is a battle that, by 2019, British citizens will be fighting alone. Leavers live in a fantasy world in which these battles can be better fought without the EU. But the fight against fake news, abuse of personal data and the battle for more digital transparency is international. The EU is the power bloc that takes the challenge to insist data and information are properly used more seriously than any other. Donald Trump is no ally: he has repealed the US oil and mining industries’ digital obligation to reveal payments to foreign governments and his embrace of fake news is notorious. Tim Berners-Lee’s warnings are profound. If an open internet is to benefit humanity and not degenerate into a vehicle to oppress us, then we have to stand with others to exercise equivalent power. From Wednesday, that will be very much harder – perhaps one of the most important reasons to regret the folly of Brexit.

They plan to land a privately funded probe on the moon and send a small robot craft trundling over the lunar surface. If they succeed they will open up the exploitation of the moon for mining and ultimately human colonisation – and earn $20m prize money as winners of the Google Lunar XPrize. Out of the 29 companies that originally entered the competition, only five remain in contention. Each has until the end of 2017, the XPrize deadline, to launch its robot mission. SpaceX to send two people around the moon who paid for a 2018 private mission Read more It is an extraordinarily ambitious task. To date, not a single piece of any competitor’s hardware has flown outside Earth’s atmosphere, while two of the rockets earmarked to send craft to the moon have still to undergo test launches. As a result, many observers now wonder if anyone will win the Google XPrize given its tight timetable. Naveen Jain, co-founder of Moon Express – one of the five remaining competitors – is bullish, however. “We have tested our lander. We have tried out all our hardware and software and we have raised all the money we need to complete the mission. We are very confident.” The rules for the Google XPrize are straightforward. The winning robot craft must be the first to land on the moon and must then travel 500 metres over the lunar surface while sending back high-resolution images to Earth. At the same time, at least 90% of the mission must be commercially funded. The first team to succeed in this undertaking will win $20m, with further bonuses on offer. For example, a spacecraft that not only lands successfully but also survives a lunar night – which lasts for two Earth weeks when temperatures drop to minus 173 degrees – will win an extra prize of several million dollars. The aim of the exercise is “to incentivise space entrepreneurs to create a new era of affordable access to the moon and beyond,” say the organisers. It was set up 10 years ago, attracting considerable interest from aerospace investors. Most would-be competitors have since dropped out as the technical hurdles of the mission have proved too onerous. The five now left are: Returning to Earth was the real nail-biting part of the Apollo missions. Competitors won’t have to worry about that. Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal ■ TeamIndus of India. Set up by dotcom entrepreneur Rahul Narayan, this outfit is backed by a several major Indian businesses. ■ Hakuto of Japan, which has developed its own four-wheel rover for trundling over the lunar surface ■ Israel’s SpaceIL. It has received substantial backing from American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and it wants to create an “Apollo moment” when it lands, thus inspiring the young to pursue careers in science and engineering. ■ Synergy Moon, an international concern with individuals from 15 countries, which will use a Neptune 8 rocket, built and launched by Interorbital Systems, to carry a lander and at least one rover to the moon. ■ Moon Express. Funded by Naveen Jain, the founder of dotcom search giant InfoSpace, it has set its sights on mining the moon for minerals and is the only competitor yet to receive permission from the US Federal Aviation Administration to land a craft on the lunar surface. Most of the challengers have invested sums up to $60m to develop their technology – though several have to finalise this funding. The benefits of taking part in the competition were nevertheless clear, said the Astronomer Royal, Martin Rees. “Challenge prizes like these are very good ideas. They have played major roles in developing driverless cars and the development of private launch systems like Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and they could do the same for roboticised space missions.” In future, said Rees, humanity would depend more and more on robot craft to assemble telescopes and to build orbiting solar power plants and to operate mines on asteroids. “Such operations are not likely to be in use for many decades, but challenges like these definitely help to get things moving.” It remains to be seen if any of the missions make it to the moon by the end of the year. All are rudimentary in concept, are largely untested and employ a wide variety of technologies. Moon Express will not use a rover to cross the lunar surface, for example. It will employ the craft’s rocket engines to hop across it. Similarly, its craft will be launched on a Rocket Lab electron launcher, from New Zealand, while Synergy Moon’s rocket will blast off from an ocean launch pad. This wide variety of approaches has left some bemused observers viewing the competition as a lunar Wacky Races. For his part, Moon Express’s chief executive Bob Richards acknowledged that its lander did look a bit like a flying washing machine. “Actually it looks more like R2-D2. But it will work,” he insisted. However, one awkward task that faced past lunar efforts – returning to Earth – will not be a problem that will affect these competitors. Yes, they will have to overcome the headaches of launching a spacecraft from Earth and they will have to land it gently on the moon, a world that lacks atmosphere and thus precludes the use of parachutes. However, there is no requirement in the Google XPrize regulations for competitors to bring their craft back to Earth. They will be left on the lunar surface as possible visiting sights for future tourists. “That does make things a little easier,” said Rees. “Returning to Earth was the real nail-biting part of the Apollo missions. At least competitors won’t have to worry about that.” As to follow-up missions, competitors are also divided. SpaceIL says that if it wins the XPrize, the money will be invested – not on further space missions but into educational grants. By contrast, Moon Express has pledged that regardless of winning the prize or not it intends to embark on a long-term strategy of mining on the moon. “This effort is just the start,” said Richards. “We see a real future up there.” Topics The moon The Observer Space Google news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Wednesday March 29, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP  Sunday, March 26, 2017, 6:59 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 Eds: Updates with additional details, context. Adds byline, Adds AP photo. SAN FRANCISCO -- An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube _ an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,'' Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. PREVIOUS ARTICLE Can Ford Lio Ho buy a comeback?

On a party-line vote of 50-48, the Senate passed a joint resolution that would bar the Federal Communications Commission from enforcing rules it approved last year — when it was under Democratic control — that sought to ban internet service providers like cable and cellphone companies from selling your data without your consent. The vote has little immediate impact: The measure would have to pass the House and be signed by President Donald Trump before it could become law. No timetable for House action has been set. In the meantime, the FCC rules that the measure would overturn aren't scheduled to go into effect until December. If it becomes law, the measure, in effect, would preserve a two-track regulatory system that treats ISPs — the companies that connect you to the internet, which are overseen by the FCC — differently from web companies like Google and Facebook, which are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. The rules passed last year by the Democratic majority on the FCC would require ISPs to ask you explicitly to "opt in" to letting them share personal information. On web-based ad networks, data sharing is usually turned on by default and you have to dig through menus and setting and opt out of it. Here's why that's important: Just by themselves, Google and Facebook take in 54 percent to 60 percent of all U.S. digital ad revenue, depending on who's doing the counting. More tellingly, Google and Facebook snapped up 90 percent of all new online ad spending in the first half of 2016, the last period for which complete figures are available, according to data compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers U.S. for the Internet Advertising Bureau. That leaves everybody else to fight it out for the remaining 10 percent of new ad spending. And the big cable and phone companies said the Senate vote was a step toward keeping that tiny playing field somewhat level. CTIA, formerly the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, applauded the measure's sponsors Thursday for "seeking a common-sense and harmonized approach to protecting Americans' privacy." "Wireless carriers are committed to safeguarding consumer privacy, and we support regulatory clarity and uniformity across our digital economy," it said in a statement. Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the newly Republican-led FCC, also welcomed the Senate vote, telling reporters afterward: "My own core goal is to make sure that [the] uniform expectation of privacy is vindicated through the use of a regulatory framework that establishes a more level playing field." But advocates for online privacy slammed the vote. Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel specializing in surveillance and privacy issues for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Senate was content to "sacrifice the privacy rights of Americans in the interest of protecting the profits of major internet companies, including Comcast, AT&T and Verizon." (NBC News is a division of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast Corp., the nation's largest cable provider.) Others noted that the measure would also bar the FCC from advancing "substantially similar" rules in the future, which Kate Tummarello, a policy analyst for the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said "would be a crushing loss for online privacy." "ISPs act as gatekeepers to the Internet, giving them incredible access to records of what you do online," Tummarello said. "They shouldn't be able to profit off of the information about what you search for, read about, purchase and more without your consent." They were joined by Mignon Clyburn, the only Democratic member of the FCC, who said the Senate measure would "frustrate the FCC's future efforts to protect the privacy of voice and broadband customers." The vote, she said, opens up "a massive gap in consumer protection law."

On Thursday, the streaming music service mostly known as a place to hear podcasts and remixes from unknown DJs confirmed that it had taken $US70 ($92) million in debt funding — basically a loan from various investors — in order to stay in business. It's never a good sign when venture-backed companies have to raise money from debt financing groups, because it indicates that traditional investors don't have much hope for the company. This appears to be the case for SoundCloud, as TechCrunch reports that the debt funding was raised because the company couldn't close a $US100 ($131) million round of funding. Back in February, when SoundCloud released its 2015 financial information, we found out that the company had lost $US55 ($72) million for the year and was at the risk of running out of cash. Yet, while having an extra $US70 ($92) million is certainly helpful, it's probably not going to be enough to save SoundCloud from the fate of Rdio, Grooveshark, MOG and other failed music streaming services. In fact, looking at the landscape, streaming services in general are kind of screwed. The payment model for streaming music services makes it very difficult for companies to actually make money. In addition to infrastructure costs, payroll and marketing, music licensing fees paid to the labels mean that the profit margin for subscription streaming is often negative. Profitability, even for the biggest players, is still largely a pipe dream. As a result, it's a game where only services with a lot of funding and a lot of users (Spotify), or a lot of backing by a parent company and a lot of users (Apple Music), are relatively safe. At least for now. But who is the most screwed? Who is just sort of screwed? Who has the best shot at surviving? Here is a ranking of streaming music companies, ranked from most to least screwed. Most screwed 1. PonoMusic PonoMusic technically isn't a streaming service, but we included it on the list because it's just so very stuffed. You may recall that Neil Young's terrible Pono Player had an accompanying online store from which Pono owners could buy high resolution music. Hilariously, that store didn't even get Young's May 2016 single (it was a Tidal exclusive), which was a very bad sign for the future of both the service and player. In July, the company announced that the PonoMusic store would be going "offline" as it switched to a new source for its content. But more than eight months later, the store is still offline. In fact, Pono hasn't tweeted since January and the music player doesn't appear to be for sale on its website. If PonoMusic ever makes an actual comeback, we will be shocked. 2. SoundCloud Poor SoundCloud. The service has raised an enormous amount of money — $US320 ($420) million since 2009, according to Crunchbase — and the product is good. It's also known as a launching ground for indie artists before they make it big (Chance the Rapper, Lorde are famous alums) and it's been platform to which aspiring DJs could upload their tracks. But the reality is that SoundCloud can't compete against its bigger, better-funded rivals. The fact that it couldn't close a funding round and had to raise debt instead speaks volumes. Moreover, SoundCloud Go, its premium product, hasn't exactly pulled in paying users — in fact, the company had to launch a dumbed-down, cheaper version last month. Here's a bet: Within 12 months, Spotify or Google is going to buy SoundCloud. 3. Tidal Tidal has basically been a disaster since Jay-Z relaunched it back in 2015. In just two years, the company has gone through multiple CEOs, faced lawsuits from customers and employees and was reportedly late with payments to some of its indie labels. Even Jay-Z feels like he was ripped off! Tidal might last a bit longer, but eventually, Jay-Z will probably get tired of investing money in a service no one cares about and give up the ghost. 4. Napster/Rhapsody You didn't misread that. Napster — or at least its brand name — is still around. Of course, the only thing that remains of the original peer-to-peer music app is the logo — everything else is actually just Rhapsody, one of the very first streaming music services. (The two merged back in 2011.) In many ways, the Spotifys and Apple Musics of the world owe a huge debt to Rhapsody/Napster. Rhapsody was the first subscription service that licensed streaming music from all of the major label groups. But being early isn't always a good thing, and the company has struggled over the years. As of 2015, it had just 3.5 million paying subscribers. We're more and more amazed that Napster/Rhapsody is still alive with every year that passes. 5. Pandora Pandora is in a heap of trouble — take note of its depressing financial results and recent layoffs — but unlike most of the other stand-alone music services, it's also a public company. More importantly, Pandora has users. Pandora's free product has about 81 million monthly active users, which makes it one of the most popular services around. The problem, however, is that those users aren't making the company any money. It's pinning a lot of its hopes to its new Pandora Premium service, but early reviews say that it has nothing to offer over Spotify or Apple Music. If its stock plummets far enough, Pandora could be a great takeover target. Medium screwed 6. Deezer Deezer isn't very popular in the US, but the service has more than six million users across the globe. The company planned a French IPO back in 2015, but ended up cancelling it, citing "market conditions" — that's code for "Pandora is tanking and we're afraid our share price will be bad" — but still managed to raise another $US109 ($143) million in January 2016. It's hard to say what the future of Deezer is, but the company hasn't made any layoffs, so that's an OK sign. 7. Groove Music Microsoft's music service isn't exactly a focal point for the company. (In fact, we forgot it existed until we started writing this story.) And that's why it's medium-level screwed. On the one hand, Groove Music has Microsoft's very pliant coffers to keep it up and running. On the other hand, if Microsoft decides it's bored of doing its own streaming service (as Sony did back in 2015), it could wind up nuking the service. 8. iTunes Music Store Technically, iTunes isn't a streaming service, but its importance in the digital music space earns it a place on this list. For nearly a decade, iTunes was the most popular place to buy digital music. But times are changing. In January, Nielsen reported that in 2016, music streaming overtook digital music downloads for the first time. That means that iTunes's revenues are declining, and that's bad for the traditional iTunes Music Store. The good news is that Apple has an alternative for iTunes waiting in the wings: Apple Music. Last May, music industry analyst Mark Mulligan predicted that Apple Music revenue would overtake iTunes Music Store revenue by 2020, at which point Apple might consider turning off the old download store. Within a few years, the iTunes Music store will probably be stuffed, but for now, it's still the most popular way to buy music. Least screwed 9. Google Play Music Google Play Music isn't as popular as the other major streaming players, but the fact that it's backed by Google gives it a good shot at survival. Google Play Music is actually a few things: It's part iTunes (you can buy songs); part iTunes Match (you can upload songs you downloaded elsewhere for access anywhere); and part Apple Music. As a bonus, anyone who subscribes to Google Play Music also gets a YouTube Red subscription, and vice versa. For $US10 ($13) a month, that's a lot of streaming music and ad-free YouTube content. 10. iHeartRadio iHeartRadio is run by iHeartMedia (the company formerly known as Clear Channel Communications), and thus has a huge tie-in with most of the nation's largest radio stations. iHeartRadio might not have cachet of Spotify, but with 100 million registered users in the US, it has a lot of ears. Moreover, because its owner is the biggest player in the terrestrial radio business, it doesn't have the same financial issues as Slacker or Pandora. iHeartRadio might not be cool, but it's also not screwed. 11. Spotify Make no mistake: Spotify has some very real business problems. For one, it can't make money, though some investors insist it might find profitability this year. For another, musicians and labels don't all love the service. And the longer it delays its IPO, the more money it owes some of its investors. None of that is great. But the reality is that Spotify is far and away the biggest streaming service globally — both paid and free — on the planet, with more than 50 million paying users. Moreover, even though labels and artists often decry how much Spotify pays them, only the biggest artists can actually afford to not be on the service. Post-IPO, Spotify could be screwed, but for now, it's the definition of too big to fail. 12. Apple Music Let's be honest: Apple Music will probably never outpace Spotify in number of subscribers. Spotify had at least a four-year head start, and it has a free product that can get people hooked. But that doesn't matter. In less than two years, Apple Music has managed to attract more than 20 million paying subscribers, something no company on this list (save Spotify) can even fathom reaching. Plus, Apple Music is backed by the richest corporation in the world. And as stated above, in the future, Apple Music will likely be the iTunes Music Store's replacement. As revenue for the iTunes Music Store declines, Apple is going to do everything in its power to make Apple Music make up the difference. Ones we've already lost Rdio: Rdio was acquired by Pandora in 2015 and was the basis for the new Pandora Premium. A lot of us really loved Rdio, but in the end, its death was entirely predictable. Grooveshark: Who knew a business model built entirely on intellectual property theft wouldn't work? (Not even OG Napster was as brazen as Grooveshark.) The service, which was awesome for music fans — if not great for musicians — was wonderful, but it was sued out of existence back in 2015. Beats Music: Beats Music launched in January 2014, and as music services go, it was pretty rad. Then Apple bought Beats in May of 2014 for $US3 ($4) billion. It ended up using the underpinnings of Beats Music for Apple Music, which was launched in 2015. MOG: Beats Music might be Apple Music's precursor, but Beats Musics' precursor was MOG. For a brief moment, it looked like MOG could make a name for itself (it was available in the US before Spotify and offered a similar service), but it couldn't compete and was sold to Beats for just $US12 ($16) million in 2012. Songza: Songza was never that popular, but its curated playlists made it a favourite for many music lovers. Google acquired the service in 2014 and shut it down at the beginning of 2016. Fortunately, most of Songza's best features are now integrated into Google Play Music. Last.fm (for streaming): Last.fm used to be a great way to stream music, but its owner, CBS, shut down that feature in 2014. The scrobbling service — the Last.fm term for making a record of every song a person listens to — still exists. Milk Music: Samsung tried to enter the streaming music space in 2014 with the bizarrely named Milk Music. But the service curdled and ultimately shut down in September 2016. GhostTunes: Country superstar Garth Brooks famously hates digital music, including iTunes. Still, even Brooks had to recognise that even the most ardent Chris Gaines fans are annoyed by CDs. In 2014, Brooks launched GhostTunes, his own shitty version of iTunes. Amazingly, the service managed to exist until Amazon bought it (and the digital rights to Brooks' catalogue) in October 2016. Sony Music Unlimited: Sony used to have its own subscription streaming service. Sony Music Unlimited launched in the US in early 2011, just a few months before Spotify's stateside debut, but never managed to gain a lot of users. Sony conceded defeat in early 2015, ditching its own program for a Spotify-backed service. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments MartyH @martyh Mar 26, 2017, 11:58am Oh great. I love SoundCloud and have subscriptions to Tidal and Pandora. One of the best things about streaming is when there is a social element. When people are discussing the music and making comments. I also have a subscription to Google Play Music, but there's none of that there. Pandora is, step by step, shutting away its social/comments section and SoundCloud put it in a dark corner long ago. The buzz around the services has been removed. The place for that now is YouTube, with all its faults. It seems that they don't recognise the aspects that draw people in, like a physical crowd of people around something interesting. Added to that the cardboard sound quality (they actually remove the treble from the music to save bandwidth - I turn up the treble in the equaliser but it's only a partial fix) and the appeal fades for these services. The large music library is all that's left. Reply 0 robb @robb Mar 26, 2017, 12:14pm JB Hifi Radio can be added to the list of "already lost" Reply 0 jjcoolaus @jjcoolaus Mar 27, 2017, 8:42am This article was written by Gizmodo US, so don't expect to see any Australian element here. I was surprised however that guvera isn't in the list. This one was closed in the US and Australia in 2016 (despite being an Australian company). They have decided to focus on emerging markets such as India & Indonesia. iHeartRadio is also gaining popularity here and locally it is backed by ARN (Australian Radio Network) & Fairfax. That one is relatively safe as commercial terrestrial radio realises it's future is in apps. Fortunately they have also been smart enough to make an unmetering deal with one of our biggest carriers, instantly taking away the deterrent of data use from using online radio. Reply 2 lee @lee Mar 26, 2017, 1:06pm So if I'm reading this right, traditional online music stores like iTunes are in peril because of streaming music services, and streaming services are in peril because they can't make money? Reply 2 ad_mechx_pwa @ad_mechx_pwa Mar 26, 2017, 3:26pm the problem is that everyone knows what happens without these services... people just download it. Music piracy has been slashed in the last 10 years because of these services. Something will likely have to change with streaming services to keep going. Probably a price hike. Reply 0 jjcoolaus @jjcoolaus Mar 27, 2017, 8:46am I doubt that will happen as Google, Spotify and Apple battle it out. Apple & Google in particular want to keep their users in their own ecosystem, as what you listen to provides so much in the way of analytics about you as a person, once advertisers harness that information making profits won't be much of a drama. Reply 0 robb @robb Mar 26, 2017, 3:47pm I think it was more: - traditional online music stores like iTunes are in peril because of streaming music services - and all but the major/profitable streaming services are in peril because they can't make money Reply 0 lee @lee Mar 26, 2017, 3:58pm But none of the music streaming services seem to be profitable? I suspect what will happen is people will be lured to streaming services because of the affordable pricing and vast catalogue, causing the traditional purchase of music to become unpopular and eventually unviable. Over time, the price of streaming music services will rise to the point where people are wondering why they're renting their music rather than buying. Reply 2 soldant @soldant Mar 26, 2017, 9:12pm Exactly. Paying $12 a month for all the music you like, versus people buying single tracks at $2.49 or whatever... that's a big difference in terms of average spend per person per track (depending on how often someone buys music). It's great for discouraging piracy, but if you're a mega label with manufactured pop stars chasing green, that's a big cut to your income. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 27, 2017, 9:31am Streaming services pay on the same principle that radio stations do. The sad thing is the reason radio stations never cut into song purchases was because they weren't on-demand. The whole arrangement relied on the fact that radio was inconvenient. Now there are much more convenient 'radio stations', it's becoming clear that in most cases people don't actually want to 'own' songs, they just want to be able to listen to them when they feel like it. There's still a market for buying albums and people who do it, it's just smaller now that people aren't forced into it to have the convenience of song choice. Reply 0 chrisco1 @chrisco1 Mar 27, 2017, 10:08am I see streaming as advertisement for the artist. That way they get off their arse and go on tour and make money from their live shows.. Long gone are the days you can release an album and sit back in your mansion watching the money roll in, you'll have to keep working for it like the rest of us ;). Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Mar 27, 2017, 3:42pm Sorry to burst your bubble, but that doesn't work for 90% or more artists. My band, for example, will be playing at a big festival in Germany in June. We'll be paid 800 euros for the opportunity, which is pretty decent money, except we've already spent more than four grand on airfares, van hire and accommodation. We've played that festival before so we know we'll be lucky if we sell $50 worth of merchandise, so we've made the decision not to bring any this time and save on unaccompanied baggage. We spent four months trying to organise other shows around the festival with zero luck, despite the fact that our current album was No. 1 on the German Alternative Charts for two weeks last year and it and our singles spent more than three months in total in the charts. Touring works for the likes of Justin Bieber and Adele but for most of us, it's something we do because we love it and we're prepared to lose thousands of dollars for the privilege.

I've tried Spotify and Apple Music but with YouTube Red to sweeten the deal, I'm now using Google Play. Reply 0 neiln @neiln Mar 27, 2017, 2:44pm No mention of Guvera. Not surprising really. Some things are best forgotten. But MixRadio was awesome. Reply 0 delta @delta Mar 28, 2017, 2:28pm All these streaming services above will be dwarfed when Facebook launches their streaming service which is reportedly in the planning stages, they already have 1.9bn monthly active users, so God help all of them including Spotify. I personally prefer to own my music from itunes, don't want to rely on a streaming service keeping it's doors open to access my music. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

With this official Android integrated development environment on Chrome OS, could it make Chromebooks/Chromeboxes a great platform for Android development? This bug report from two days ago makes it public that Google is working on Android Studio support for Chrome OS. Having this Android IDE on Chrome OS makes it possible to both test and run Android apps, something not available for native testing when developing Android apps on Linux, macOS, or Windows. The Android Studio support is delivered using XWayland. It will be interesting to see in the weeks/months ahead what comes of this Android Studio support on Chrome OS and if Google ends up using it as a selling point for Chrome devices. Perhaps we'll learn more at the upcoming Google I/O conference. 20 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

This is a large incremental update to Android 5.0, and over the last three months users have been getting early access to a developer preview called Android M. Now the last Android 6.0 Marshmallow developer preview is available, and here’s how users can install it right now. Android 6.0 isn’t available yet, but a final developer preview is. Google is offering developers and enthusiasts access to an Android M beta ahead of the official release, which is what we’ll be doing below. They’ve confirmed Android 6.0 will arrive before the end of September, but select Nexus owners can try it right now. Those on the developer preview 1 or 2 will get an over the air update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow preview 3. Read: Android M Developer Preview 3: 5 Things to Know The Android M DP3 System Image is a download that contains all the files needed to install a stock version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow (preview 3) on the Nexus 5, 6, 9 or Player. This is essentially everything that you would download as an OTA update for regular Android updates. Read on for all the details. Android 6.0 Marshmallow will deliver a variety of new features, improvements to battery life with a feature called Doze, Android Pay, native fingerprint support, multi-window mode, Google Now on Tap, USB Type-C ports, and much more for Android smartphones and tablets. There is a lot going on behind the scenes, and a few changes visually, and some users will want to try all of that early. Before we start it needs to be said that this is not official software that average users should install to their daily devices. This is an early developer preview (beta) of Android 6.0 for testing and getting apps prepared for all of the changes, and may not be 100% stable. Features are missing like Android Pay or Google Now on Tap, some apps are broken or may not be compatible either. That said, proceed with caution and at your own risk. Read: Android M vs Android 5.1: What’s New So Far This guide will show you how to install the latest Nexus Android 6.0 Developer Preview 3 software. This is something you can do from Windows, Mac, Linux or ChromeOS. There are multiple ways this can be done, and lots of things that can go wrong, but below are the easiest steps without spending hours setting up all of Google’s developer software. How to Install ADB on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu & ChromeOS Before you can install the Android 6.0 Developer Preview to the Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 9 or others you will need to install ADB and Fastboot to your computer. This is a program that runs on your PC/Mac to connect to your Android device through a USB cable and flash the Android software to your device. Installing ADB and Fastboot is one of the most difficult parts of installing Android factory images, but several simple tools make it incredibly easy. How to Install ADB on Windows If you are using a Windows machine, including up to Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 you can use the 15 second adb installer to streamline the process. Download the ADB installer for Windows. Find the file, right-click on it and choose Run as Administrator. When prompted you need to give the app access to run as an administrator. After the app launches type a Y and enter to select yes to Install ADB & Fastboot, to intsll ADB/Fastboot systemwide and to install Drivers. When a new window pops up follow the steps to install the drivers. After this is installed you should be ready to install the Android 6.0 on a supported Nexus device. How to Install ADB on Mac, Linux & ChromeOS Nexus Tools makes it easy to install ADB on a Mac, Linux or even ChromeOS. All you need to do is open Terminal on your computer and past in the code from xda. Open terminal by going to search, and simply typing Terminal and opening the program. This will install ADB and Fastboot on Mac, Linux and Chrome OS without the need to do anything else. It’s extremely easy, and avoids all the ADB package mess that typically takes hours to complete. After the script completes you can type ADB or Fastboot to start running either program. This is where you’ll need to be to flash the new Android M system images provided by Google onto your device. Remember to head into settings > developer options and enable USB Debugging first. How to Install the Android 6.0 Dev Preview Now The first thing you need to do is download the just released Android 6.0 Developer Preview 3 System Image for your device. You can find them at the links below. You’ll have to agree to the terms that this is a preview copy only, and then proceed. We’ve already noticed a few features missing, so again, proceed at your own risk. Nexus 5 Android 6.0 Preview 3 Nexus 6 Android 6.0 Preview 3 Nexus 9 Android 6.0 Preview 3 You will need to unzip these files to a folder you can access, we just unzipped it to our Mac desktop. After you have the Android M system image unzipped you will need to find this folder and type cmd into the address bar on Windows, or open terminal and change the folder to this folder on Mac, Linux or Chrome OS. Reminder, if you’re on a MAC you need to make sure terminal is running inside the folder you just unzipped. If your Nexus is not bootloader unlocked you should do that first. We could not install any Android M System image and update with the device locked. This will wipe your device and erase all user data, settings, pictures, etc. Repeat, this will erase everything! Open a Terminal in the adb folder and type the command below then hit enter. adb reboot bootloader In Fastboot type: fastboot oem unlock Then hit enter. Follow the on-screen instructions and choose to erase the device. Wait a minute or so for it to unlock. This removes everything on your device. Flash the Factory Image Now open the folder containing the unzipped Android 6.0 Dev Preview 3 System Image file you just downloaded. Type cmd in the address bar. Type the following commands posted below and hit enter. On a Mac you can open Terminal in the folder by enabling terminal shortcuts in settings. This is key for Mac users. Head to System Preferences and select Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Find “New Terminal at Folder” in the settings and click the box. Now when you’re in Finder, just right-click a folder and you’re shown the open to open Terminal. Or just do it from the desktop where you unzipped the Factory image as shown below. Once in terminal simply copy and paste the commands below to install Android 6.0 to your Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, or even the Nexus Player. flash-all.bat This will flash all of the needed files. If you are on a Mac or other computer you will need to type; sudo ./flash-all.sh This will push all of the files and update your device to the just released Android 6.0 Marshmallow final developer preview. The files will start pushing and installing and your Nexus device may reboot and you will see an Android figure and then a moving Android logo. The logo screen may stay for a long time. Don’t unplug the device. You may run into an issue, which we did and will explain below. Read: Android 5.0 Tap N Go Restores Your Phone in Minutes Update: Many users may experience a “missing system.img” error and the installation will be aborted. This is because the way you’re trying to flash the update. Instructions on how to get around this can be found right here. Essentially users will need to unzip the update.zip folder and move all the images to the original folder we mentioned above, then manually flash them one by one starting with the bootloader, then the radio, vs the flash-all command mentioned above. Only do this if you run into issues. When the process finishes you can enter your information or Gmail account and start using Android 6.0 Marshmallow right now on Nexus smartphones and the Nexus 9 tablet. Give Google’s Tap n Go (automatically restore) a try using NFC to automatically restore and all apps, settings, accounts and more from another device. This was introduced with Android 5.0 Lollipop and also available here. We went with a clean install to start things off fresh. For those who’d rather not mess with this scary stuff, we’re expecting the official Android 6.0 update to arrive sometime later this year. Google promised a 3rd quarter release date for Nexus smartphones and tablets, and Q3 ends at the end of September. This means an official release could be here in the next 45 days along with the new Nexus 5 for 2015. For now though, this is the only way to try Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and only if you have a compatible Nexus device. The Google schedule linked to above essentially confirms Android 6.0 will be released before the end of September, over a month earlier than Android 4.4 KitKat and Android 5.0 Lollipop, so try the steps above or sit tight for just a little bit longer. Hopefully Samsung, LG, Motorola and other OEM’s quickly get updates to Android 6.0 Marshmallow out to all owners. 8 Responses 08/18/2015 Android terbaru Reply Woow Android rillis Marshmallow,, very nice 08/19/2015 Cory Gunther Reply Google released a slightly new build for all three devices above with Android for work changes..

Shortcuts are a new row of icons that appear below the Google search box that can be tapped so people can see the latest weather in the area, movie times, suggestions on places to eat or scores of their latest teams without typing anything into the search box. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. SAN FRANCISCO — Google wants to make it easier for you to find answers and recommendations on smartphones without having to think about what to ask its search engine. Its new feature, called “shortcuts,” will appear as a row of icons below the Google search box. Instead of having to ponder and then speak or type a request, the shortcuts will let you tap the icons to get the latest weather, movie showtimes, sports scores, restaurant recommendations and other common requests. The shortcuts began appearing Tuesday in updates to Google's app for iPhones, Android phones and its mobile website. The Android app will also include various tools such as a currency converter, a language translator and an ATM locator, which you can also summon with a tap. Those tools may eventually make it to the iPhone as well, although Google says it doesn't know when. Your backup brain The changes are the latest step in Google's quest to turn its search engine into a secondary brain that anticipates people's needs and desires. The search engine gleans these insights by analyzing your past requests and, when you allow it, tracking your location, a practice that periodically raises privacy concerns about Google's power to create digital profiles of its users. Based on the knowledge that Google already has accumulated, its shortcuts feature may already list your favorite sports teams or recommend nearby restaurants serving cuisines you prefer. Shortcuts also show how Google's search engine has been adapting to its audience, now that smartphones have become the primary way millions of people stay connected to the internet. Going mobile Since more than half of requests for Google's search engine now come from smartphones, the Mountain View, Calif., company has adapted its services to smaller screens, touch keyboards and apps instead of websites. Early in that process, Google tweaked its search engine to answer many requests with factual summaries at the top of its results page, a change from simply displaying a list of links to other websites. Voice-recognition technology also allows you to speak your request into a phone instead of typing it. The transition is going well so far. Google's revenue rose 20 percent last year to $89 billion, propelled by digital ads served up on its search engine, YouTube and Gmail. Although shortcuts won't initially show ads after you tap them, Google typically sells marketing space if a feature or service becomes popular.

The technology firm  also  confirmed that it has reached its target early, and has set itself to train even more Africans in digital skills in the coming year. The Digital Skills programme offers 89 courses through the online  portal, and Google works with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face to face training. L – R: Smart Akande, Legal Adviser, Office of SSA to the President on sustainable development goals, Moni Udoh, Director ICT, Ministry of Communication, Bunmi Banjo, Head of Brands and Digital Skills at Google Nigeria, Ife Adebayo, Special Assistant, Innovation & Entrepreneurships, office of the Vice President at the Google Digital Skills for Africa 1M Milestone Announcement that held recently at The George, Lagos. The programme is expected to address  needs for small business owners, who are looking to better understand how to take advantage of the web across Africa. Accordingly,  Google will add web-focused skills training for SMEs across Africa as part of this initiative. In addition to the new target, Google is extending its commitment to the Digital Skills programme by assisting local communities further in several ways including provision of  offline versions of its online training materials to reach individuals and businesses in low access areas where it is unable to hold physical training sessions. Additionally, Google would  provide offline versions of the content in languages like Hausa, Swahili and IsiZulu. The Digital Skills programme offers 89 courses through the online https://digitalskills.w ithgoogle.com/ portal, and Google works with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face to face training. Speaking on the new development, Google Nigeria country Manager Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, in a press conference in Lagos last week,   said that the  Web is a driver of economic growth,  transforming society as a whole. “ People must be equipped, through training and reskilling to make use of the tools, and take advantage of it for entrepreneurship, employment and e-inclusion, ” Our goal with this and previous web training initiatives is to enable more people across the continent better understand how to leverage the Web tools for growth – to give them access to better employment and/or the skills to start their own businesses. “A digitally skilled Africa is good for everyone – for our economy, for entrepreneurs and individuals. And yes, good for internet companies like Google” “Having 1 million digitally skilled young people in Africa is good for everyone. If young people have the right skills, they’ll build businesses, create jobs and boost economic growth across the continent,” Bunmi Banjo, Growth Engine & Brand Lead, Sub-Saharan Africa, adding that, “As we expand this initiative to reach more local areas across the continent, we hope to see more impact in everyday lives of Africans.” The post Digital literacy for Africa: Google trains 1m Africans in digital skills appeared first on Vanguard News.

The company today announced it’s opening Posts up to organizations.

FIND OUT WHY Posts are an experiment to allow participants to post updates directly in Google’s search results. If you think you’re about to see Google turn into a social site, you’ll be disappointed. Posts seem to have been designed for public figures to communicate directly with people who are searching their names: So if you’re searching for the Henry Ford Museum in the U.S. or for Vanessa da Mata in Brazil, you’ll see updates directly from the source with relevant information, like new exhibits, timely updates and interesting facts. Posts were rolled out last year. There’s no word on if this will ever be available to the general public, or only public figures.

Last month, Google had announced that they are aware of the issue and had fixed it, and that it will be rolled out to the device shortly. Google confirmed today that it has finished putting the fix in place and that affected devices should be working now properly. Moreover, there is no update that needs to be installed by the user and the fix is installed automatically. Google confirmed that it is a server-side update and it's likely that the fix was installed through Google Play Services update, which happens automatically in the background. Any other devices affected by this should likely get fixed too.

The technology firm  also  confirmed that it has reached its target early, and has set itself to train even more Africans in digital skills in the coming year. The Digital Skills programme offers 89 courses through the online  portal, and Google works with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face to face training. L – R: Smart Akande, Legal Adviser, Office of SSA to the President on sustainable development goals, Moni Udoh, Director ICT, Ministry of Communication, Bunmi Banjo, Head of Brands and Digital Skills at Google Nigeria, Ife Adebayo, Special Assistant, Innovation & Entrepreneurships, office of the Vice President at the Google Digital Skills for Africa 1M Milestone Announcement that held recently at The George, Lagos. The programme is expected to address  needs for small business owners, who are looking to better understand how to take advantage of the web across Africa. Accordingly,  Google will add web-focused skills training for SMEs across Africa as part of this initiative. In addition to the new target, Google is extending its commitment to the Digital Skills programme by assisting local communities further in several ways including provision of  offline versions of its online training materials to reach individuals and businesses in low access areas where it is unable to hold physical training sessions. Additionally, Google would  provide offline versions of the content in languages like Hausa, Swahili and IsiZulu. The Digital Skills programme offers 89 courses through the online https://digitalskills.w ithgoogle.com/ portal, and Google works with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face to face training. Speaking on the new development, Google Nigeria country Manager Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, in a press conference in Lagos last week,   said that the  Web is a driver of economic growth,  transforming society as a whole. “ People must be equipped, through training and reskilling to make use of the tools, and take advantage of it for entrepreneurship, employment and e-inclusion, ” Our goal with this and previous web training initiatives is to enable more people across the continent better understand how to leverage the Web tools for growth – to give them access to better employment and/or the skills to start their own businesses. “A digitally skilled Africa is good for everyone – for our economy, for entrepreneurs and individuals. And yes, good for internet companies like Google” “Having 1 million digitally skilled young people in Africa is good for everyone. If young people have the right skills, they’ll build businesses, create jobs and boost economic growth across the continent,” Bunmi Banjo, Growth Engine & Brand Lead, Sub-Saharan Africa, adding that, “As we expand this initiative to reach more local areas across the continent, we hope to see more impact in everyday lives of Africans.” Urowayino Warami View all posts by Urowayino Warami → Previous Post Rutger Reman becomes MD, Ericsson Nigeria Next Post Tecno adopts new strategy, streamline brands messaging, experience with Camon series Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

On Friday, PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks all announced that they would suspend their YouTube advertising until the company addressed their concerns about ads appearing alongside homophobic and racist videos. AT&T, Verizon, and the UK government had pulled their ads earlier this month, after it was revealed that white supremacists, Holocaust deniers, and other hateful content creators were generating revenue from many brand’s ads. Deciphering and categorizing YouTube content is admittedly a Herculean task. As Ronan Harris, the managing director for Google U.K., said in a blog post on the issue: “Just last year, we removed nearly 2 billion bad ads from our systems, removed over 100,000 publishers from our AdSense program, and prevented ads from serving on over 300 million YouTube videos.” With so much content, compounded by the complexity of cataloging video as a medium, it would be unfair to expect YouTube to have a perfect system. However, this oversight is particularly glaring given YouTube’s recent LGBTQIA snafu and previous ad policies. A wide variety of LGBTQIA content, including all-ages programming, was recently categorized as “mature” and therefore unavailable when viewing the site in “Restricted Mode.” YouTube was rightly blasted for the move, which treats the very existence of LGBTQIA people as something lewd and unsuitable for children. WTF. Back in September, YouTube was also criticized for pulling ad revenue from videos about issues like depression or acne. These videos were deemed “controversial” and therefore insufficiently “ad-friendly,” but now we discover that David Duke’s screeds got enough of a pass to feature ads for the UK Royal Navy. What sort of system are they using? Algorithms are not neutral. They inherit the inherent biases of their creators, and YouTube seems to be struggling against those of its employees. YouTube is a subsidiary of Google, a company whose technical staff is 81% male and 57% white. It is perhaps unsurprising that the terminology of racism and sexism wasn’t as well-documented by this workforce, and videos featuring that language therefore slipped through and received ad revenue. Still, it’s on YouTube to foresee and combat these problems. Engineers can’t be expected to be perfect, but a major company can be expected to double-check those engineers’ work. In a Tuesday blog post from Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, the company promised to address advertisers’ concerns with a “tougher stance” on hateful content. “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites.” YouTube’s concrete steps include: changing the default settings for ads to “meet[] a higher level of brand safety and exclude[] potentially objectionable content,” making it easier for advertisers to exclude specific channels from their ad buy, and adding more advanced controls so that brands can “fine-tune” their advertising. It’s not yet clear how wide-reaching these changes will be, or whether YouTube will accidentally block other, not-racist content in its sweep. The wider the ad restrictions, the likelier it is that content which is not morally objectionable will get picked up by those restrictions. And while depriving a channel of ad revenue is a far cry from “censorship” (you do not have a legal right to make money on someone else’s video-upload site), YouTube’s greatest asset is its unconventional, honest community of creators. It would be a real loss to make their careers less viable by getting too ham-fisted in appeasing the advertisers. With all the resources at their disposal, I hope YouTube can finally calibrate this one correctly, defunding the racists without robbing the rest of their creators.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Nexus and Pixel smartphone owners should be happy to know that Android 8.0 is now live. The factory images have been uploaded on Google’s own Android Developer website. We should disclose that the update is still in its beta phase and it’s not very stable. This is why Google won’t roll it out to the wide public yet. Although, interested Android users can install the operating system right now. The Android parent is expected to start rolling out the public version of Android 8.0 after its I/O May event. Fortunately, tech savvy Android users don’t need to wait that long. Today we’re going to present readers with a guide on how to get, and how to install Google’s latest operating system update. Android 8.0 Oreo Compatible Smartphones Nexus Player; Nexus 5X; Nexus 6P; Google Pixel; Google Pixel XL; Pixel C; Download Android 8.0 Oreo First off, interested readers must be enlisted in Google’s Android Beta Program in order to access this operating system. The registration process is simple and it shouldn’t take more than five minutes. Once Android users have registered in the Beta Program, they can access the Settings – About – System Updates panel. The update will be there and all that users need to do is to hit the download button. However, the factory images for Android 8.0 O can be manually downloaded as well. Although, the flashing process can get quite complicated at times but we’re going to take it step by step. Manually Installing Android 8.0 Oreo Download and install Android Debug Bridge (ABD) on a PC; Right click on “My Computer” and then select “Properties” and “Advanced System Settings”; Now select the “Environment Variables” panel and click on “Edit” then type in the name of the directory where SDK has been installed’ The designated smartphone should have USB Debugging enabled. In order to do that access Settings – About Phone – Software Information and click the “Build number” seven times in a row; Access “Settings – Developer Options” and enable “USB debugging”; Download the specific OTA factory image and connect the designated smartphone to the PC; Using the previously downloaded ADB tool, open the command terminal and type in the following “adb reboot recovery”; By simultaneously holding and pressing the Volume up key and Power Button a menu will appear. Using the same keys highlight “Apply Update” and confirm; Now back to the ADB tool (on the PC), type in the following “adb sideload (ota file.zip). Remember to rename the “ota file.zip” line with the actual name of the OTA file; All that’s left now is to wait for the OS to be installed and then to reboot the smartphone once again.

For the second time, it was a surprise that the company made this step before the annual Google I/O Developer’s Conference. However, we won’t be getting the new version until the end of the summer, but if you are curious you can download Android O on compatible devices. So should you install it? Not unless you’re a developer. Google did not meant the first preview of the Android O for the large audience, which is why it’s not available on the normal Android Beta OTA channel. However, if you still want to do it (and you’re not a developer), you should know that there is the risk to brick the device. For that reason, you may want to back up everything you have on it. Which are the compatible devices? You can run the Android O Developer Preview on Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X and Nexus Player. How to download and install it You have to manually flash the software on a compatible device if you want to see the preview. However, pay attention! This step is going to erase all the data available on your device. You will find the file at: https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html. How to uninstall it If for one reason or another you decide you want to uninstall the developer preview, and then you will have to go and download the factory image of Android Nougat. You can also look for it on developers.google.com and once you find it you can download it. Of course, you will have to flash it manually to the device, so be careful with it. For this reason it is recommended not to start this if you are not sure what’s the good thing to do.

The entire Android community is highly anticipating Google to refresh its Nexus 7 tablet offering this year. Sadly, Google is keeping things under wraps and doesn’t want to confirm any rumors. Everyone started believing that Nexus 7 (2017) is only a rumor and that it will never be unveiled. Fortunately, rumors started sparking up once again when the codename “Taimen” was leaked. Nexus 7 (2017) to Arrive Under the Taimen Codename a Taimen wasn’t the first Google codename to be leaked. Walleye and Murkie were also leaked in the same Android grit. Speculations are pointing out the fact that these three codenames are going to be used for Google’s upcoming Pixel smartphones, but what no one seems to be taking in consideration is the fact that Google only launches two Pixel smartphones a year, and not three. This is what’s leading us to believe that Taimen is actually Nexus 7 (2017) in disguise. As everyone knows already, Google launched Pixel and Pixel XL in October of last year. The Android parent is following the same marketing tactic that Samsung and Apple are using. We are talking about the fact that both Samsung and Apple launch two versions of their smartphones. Nexus 7 (2017) to Replace Pixel C Pixel C is Google’s latest tablet offering and it’s safe to say that Nexus 7 (2017) is going to be its successor. What’s intriguing is that Google wants to keep using the Nexus brand name despite the fact that it’s focusing all of its attention on the newer Pixel one. The reason why Google is doing this is because the Nexus name is recognized worldwide while the Pixel one isn’t. Nexus 7 (2017) Hardware Specs The reason why the entire Android community is enthusiastic about this new tablet is because according to rumors, it’s going to be packed with incredible hardware parts. For starters, Nexus 7 (2017) is expected to ship with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chipset. This is the best mobile processor that can be found on the market right now. In addition, Google might also pair the processor with a large amount of RAM such as 6GB or 8GB. All in all, until Google decides to unveil the highly anticipated tablet we can’t know anything for sure.

Google recently rolled out this month’s security patch to Nexus 6 and surprisingly it did something more than enhance its security. Once the update has been installed, the smartphone’s Android Pay feature suddenly started malfunctioning. If things couldn’t get worse, Google announced that it’s going to exclude Nexus 6 from its Android Beta Program. Nexus 6 Receives Downgrade The aforementioned security patch caused Nexus 6 to malfunction so hard that Google was forced to roll out an Android 7.0 Nougat downgrade. The Nexus community was angered by this because Google didn’t mention this was happening and just rolled out the downgrade. Many Nexus 6 owners didn’t read the info and unknowingly downgraded their smartphone. The reason why Android Pay started malfunctioning is because Nexus 6 wasn’t able to pass the SafetyNet test anymore. This test is quite important since it decides if the smartphone in cause is secure enough to perform mobile banking and payments. However, downgrading Nexus 6’s operating system isn’t going according to plan. Because the smartphone used to run on Android 7.1.1 and its apps are not working as they should on Android 7.0. On the bright side though, Google confirmed that Nexus 6 is going to be upgraded back to Android 7.1.1 in the not so far away future. Once the Android parent manages to fix this annoying issue, Nexus 6 will go back to Android 7.1.1. Nexus 6P Receives Delayed Feature When the first build of Android 7.1.2 developer preview came out, it brought fingerprint gestures support to Nexus 5X. Everyone was shocked to find out that Nexus 6P was excluded, especially since Nexus 6P is newer than Nexus 5X. It looks like Google needed some extra time to optimize this feature so it works flawlessly on Nexus 6P because the smartphone has just received the feature in the second build of Android 7.1.2 beta. This update gives Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P owners the ability to open up their notification panel just by simply swiping over the fingerprint sensor.

Google managed to surprise the entire Android community when it released the factory images for Android O. This is the first developer preview of Android 8.0 and it can be installed by all of Google’s latest smartphones, including Nexus 6P. On the downside though, the only way to install the new operating system is by doing it manually. The process can get quite complicated at times and that’s why we will provide Nexus 6P owners with a step-by-step guide. First and foremost, we need to let Nexus 6P owners know that this is a developer preview update and it might contain bugs and glitches. Secondly, the smartphone needs to feature an unlocked bootloader and this voids the device’s warranty. In addition, the flashing process will delete the user’s entire data but this can be avoided through a simple backup. How to Flash Android O Before we can jump into the flashing process, Nexus 6P owners need to download a couple of files. Needless to say, the Android O factory image needs to be downloaded alongside the ADB and Fastboot utility tool (on a PC). Make sure to also download all the Nexus 6P specific USB drivers and an unlocked bootloader on the designated device. Set the smartphone into the Bootloader or Fastboot mode by simultaneously pressing and holding the Power Button and Volume Down key; Using the same keys, select Bootloader mode; Connect the device to a PC via USB; Open the script file and run the “flash-all.bat”; Wait for the scrip to finish and the smartphone will run on Android 8.0; Additionally, tech savvy Nexus 6P owners can manually flash the images themselves. In order to do that they will be required to type in the following commands: fastboot flash bootloader bootloader.img; fastboot flash radio radio.img; fastboot reboot-bootloader; fastboot flash system system.img; fastboot flash boot boot.img; fastboot flash recovery recovery.img; This is all if the above mentioned steps have been followed correctly, the smartphone should now run on Google’s Android O. However, we should mention that the first boot time will last longer than usual but it will only happen the first time.

The Android Police have reported that there is an interesting new feature in the new beta version of Google Maps for Android. Version 9.49 beta includes a tool that will help users recover their parked vehicles, as well as avoid getting a ticket. The tool will mark your car’s location on the map, and open a page where you can input information such as how much time is left on the meter. In order to use the tool, you just need to tap the blue dot which marks your location. A menu will open where you can choose to mark the location as a parking spot. If you’re marking a location after the fact, you can manually select the location as well. From there, the app will bring you to another screen where you can input more details and information about the parking spot. One such detail is indeed the meter time, but there are also options for which row or level you’ve parked on, if you’re in a parking structure. If you don’t want to bother with writing, the app will allow you to just take pictures of identifying markers so you can find your way back to the car. When the meter is about to run out, Google Maps will give you a popup notification, though this feature can be turned off. You can also share the parking location with other users, if you’re using the car as a meeting point, or if you’re dropping it off for someone else to drive later. As of yet, the feature is only available on Google Maps for Android devices. Apple Maps on iOS 10 has a similar parking feature for iPhone, but it requires a Bluetooth link between the car and your phone. The drawback is that it won’t work with older cars, of course, but it has the benefit of automating a lot of the functions Google requires you to input yourself. source: Forbes Leave a comment SCAN THIS QR CODE WITH YOUR PHONE Close Next Post Samsung launches C27H580 curved monitor with FreeSync support Related Post Oppo R11 with dual rear cameras expected to arrive in June Just a few days back, Oppo announced the exciting new F3 Plus ‘selfie expert’ smartphone Related Post Samsung confirms plans of selling refurbished Galaxy Note 7 units Earlier this year, a report out of South Korea had claimed that Samsung planned to Tags Android google maps © 1999 - 2016 VR Zone AP Pte.

The rain is an incessant barrage of watery bullets firing down through the tree canopy. Thunder crashes. Tangles of vines and spider webs make for a Hollywood movie scene of truly impenetrable jungle. Near the front of the seven hikers is a Welshman carrying a billhook, a backpack almost the same size as him, and what appears to all intents and purposes to be a briefcase. The slope is so steep that the heavy briefcase clatters against the ground at every step, so he swings it in front of him – clonk – like a ship using an anchor to warp out of harbour against the green, vertical tide. He takes two steps up and swings the case up the hill again. Clonk. On this wet March day in Mozambique, Professor Julian Bayliss, naturalist, explorer, fellow of the Royal Geographical and Royal Entomological societies, is heading deep into the green heart of the Mabu forest for the first time. The forest, also known as the “Google forest” after the way he “discovered” it using Google Earth in 2005, has more recently been called “the butterfly forest”, after the butterflies that congregate around the summit of Mount Mabu at certain times of year. Many of the species since identified here carry Bayliss’s name. These include Nadzikambia baylissi, the sleek little chameleon with the prehensile tail, and Cymothoe baylissi, the graceful forest gliding butterfly, both of which exist only here within the largest rainforest in southern Africa. “One other thing we have discovered on this trip,” shouts Bayliss, with a huge grin over the sound of yet another downpour on another day on another seemingly unending hillside ascent, “Mabu is not flat.” The scientific discovery of Mount Mabu was a huge breakthrough. Working with Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, the Mozambique government’s institute for agricultural research (IIAM) and the Darwin Initiative, Bayliss was sitting at his laptop looking at Google Earth in 2005, when he wondered whether mountains in Mozambique might also harbour some of the species he was uncovering in nearby Malawi. So he and a Malawian botanist named Hassam Patel decided to take a look. As reported by the Observer, over the years Bayliss and the Kew Gardens team have since identified three new species of snake, eight species of butterfly, a bat, a crab, two chameleons and many plants, as well as a trove of rare birds that are critically endangered. However, no one has ever journeyed into the heart of the forest until now. Previous discoveries came from the forest base camp, the peak and a small satellite camp, all on the lower eastern edge. To explore Mabu’s secrets further, an expedition has been undertaken this month by the international scientific and environmental reporting initiative Alliance Earth. The Alliance Earth team’s objectives were to create a 3D map, uncover new species, check on the health of the forest, publish an ethno-botanical study, seek out potential non-timber forest products, produce a feature documentary and film a 360-degree virtual reality experience for museums and science centres around the world, so everyone can explore the mountain’s mysteries. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alliance Earth’s 360-degree look at the ‘Google forest’. Copyright: Jeffrey Barbee/Alliance Earth “This is a new species of Dipsadoboa,” Bayliss says, holding the poisonous tree snake with a twinge of obvious concern. As it writhes, he holds it farther away from his torso. “This is currently undescribed, it doesn’t have a name yet.” Stretching out imploringly, the snake tries to reach the perceived safety of my video camera. “To find an actual new species of snake is extremely exciting, and very rare.” He has now found three new snakes in Mabu’s forest. According to Bayliss, on this trip the team have identified at least one new butterfly species, and quite possibly more, once genetic testing confirms them. They have also found a Caecilian, one of the rarest animals on Earth, which is sort of a cross between a reptile and amphibian, and may be a new type of its kind. The hidden treasures of Mount Mabu – in pictures Read more But these precious finds aren’t the only new discoveries that have him excited. Under a huge tree he airs his wet boots, squeezing his socks dry before putting them on again. “Yesterday was great. We discovered a new waterfall, which is fantastic. We’ve never been here before, and because it’s the rainy season the water was just crashing through the rocks.” More discoveries have come daily, such as the “valley of giants”, an open canyon with a central raised ridge surrounded by the largest grouping of big trees yet found. Their vast trunks stretch upwards like a cathedral, blending into the green nave of leaves hundreds of metres above. These waterfalls, huge trees, deep canyons, and riverside camping spots are important geographical discoveries that Bayliss hopes will help bring tourists here. At times the forest guides are clearly as perplexed about directions as the team, looping round in ever-widening circles in search of a way across the maze of folded valleys, often climbing up and down one punishing ridge after another in order to make headway. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bayliss holds what is possibly yet another previously unidentified species of butterfly. Photograph: Jeffrey Barbee Senior hunter turned guide Ofélio Cavalião, 41, and his son Bartolomeo, 26, joined the expedition one morning before breakfast, hiking from their home many kilometres away. They heard through the grapevine that Bayliss had returned and so tracked him down. Cavalião and Bayliss have worked together on every visit he has made to Mabu’s forest. The local hunter and famous scientist have developed a friendship and deep respect for one another. Once Cavalião arrived, the team started to push deeper into the most unexplored parts of the eastern forest, following the tops of the ridges and making better time. Guides such as Cavalião have an intimate knowledge of the area, making the outside “discovery” of Mabu a purely scientific designation. According to him, the local people have benefited from the forest for generations. It even saved their lives during the back-to-back conflicts that started in 1964 with the war of independence against Portugal, before segueing into the civil war that finally ended in 1992. His friend, 38-year-old guide Ernesto André, agrees. He grew up in the forest, sheltered from the ravages of war, with dozens of other people in small forest camps. Not far into the undergrowth, holes the size of unfilled graves are clearly man-made. Standing in one, André explains that these sheltered whole families and were the only way to hide the sounds of crying children from the Portuguese soldiers who tried to hunt them down. On a remote ridge line with another potential new butterfly in his net, Bayliss talks about the future of the mountain. “Every new discovery helps make the case for the mountain to be officially protected,” he says. But time is of the essence. The team finds the forest intact, yet still not officially protected. A recent report in the Guardian told how, despite a two-year ban on timber exports, corruption and organised crime are still stripping Mozambique of forests such as this. According to the independent Environmental Investigation Agency, as much as $130m worth of hardwoods are stolen from Mozambique annually. Much of it is sent to China. Ecologically aware visitors could help build a tourism industry here that protects the forest and benefits the community in a sustainable way, while safeguarding the incredible biodiversity, according to Justiça Ambiental, the Mozambican environmental justice group that has been working at Mabu since 2009 to create and implement an eco-tourism plan for the mountain. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mount Mabu expedition 2017. Produced by Alliance Earth. Edited and written by Jeffrey Barbee. Camera Jeffrey Barbee and Julian Bayliss. Copyright: Jeffrey Barbee/Alliance Earth The group’s forestry specialist, Rene Machoco, explains that its vision is for Mabu to be legally designated as a community conservation area. André says that before Justiça Ambiental came, his community didn’t think the forest was particularly valuable, “but then it was explained and we knew the truth. The forest is life and the forest is wealth”. Tourism is only one way to help people like Ernesto benefit from their home. Expedition team member Ana Alecia Lyman is a non-timber forest products specialist based in Mozambique who runs Bio Óleos de Miombo. “Non-timber forest products, such as honey or mushrooms, can be sustainably derived from the landscape to generate income in rural communities without jeopardising local biodiversity,” she says. After seeing the forest first-hand, she is enthusiastic and feels that the more people who are engaged in these sustainable value chains, the more local investment there can be in the health of the forest. Under the tree canopy, Bayliss is hunting an elusive butterfly that finally flutters and rests on the leafy forest floor in a scattered beam of sunlight. Butterflies use solar energy to fly. Their wing veins are usually dark in order to channel energy from the sun to engage their muscles. This is why when they are seen slowly folding their wings while perched in the sunlight, they are getting ready to take to the air. But the shy brown butterfly with the spotted wing markings is no match for the speedy scientist from Wales. A deft swing loops the net shut, “I think I got it!” “This is probably a new species,” he says, looking through the net and walking over to a sunny spot. Extracting it gently he examines the wing spots. “This is probably the one we have been looking for.” He looks closer. With a breathless voice he breaks with his usual understatement. “This is very exciting – this is the first time I have ever seen this butterfly.” What else awaits discovery in the remote forest of Mabu’s basin? Potential answers to that question sit snugly in Bayliss’s anchor-like briefcase: motion-sensitive video cameras, the first ever to be deployed at Mabu. Encased in steel boxes and strapped to trees, the four high-definition cameras will be left running at secret locations deep in the foliage for two years. Having finished securing the last camera above a stream, Bayliss washes his hands in the clear water among the mossy rocks, looking satisfied. “Every time we come to Mabu we discover something new. Who knows what we will find next?” The question hangs in the air as he turns around and starts back on the long hike to base camp with his butterfly net in hand, his briefcase empty, and his wet boots squishing merrily.

This has been a trend for a few years now, with the company's ecosystem constantly changing. Just a few hours ago, the Hangouts team announced yet another alteration to the service, further widening the whole Allo and Duo messaging confusion. Now industry sources say that the online titan is quietly working on yet another effort to crack the social sphere market, which has eluded it for so long. Or at least start somewhere, that is. The app, or possibly platform in question will offer a collaborative space for working on photos. In it small groups of people will, reportedly, be able to share their stills and edit them together. Sort of like a beefier version of Google Photos' shared albums, with a dash of filter magic and perhaps a few other social twists. Naturally, we can also expect the new service to leverage Google's groundbreaking machine learning algorithms for recognizing people and objects, automatic categorization and almost magic-like search capabilities. Sadly, that is all we currently know about the application. It doesn't even have a name at this point, or rather, Google is not sharing one. However, a company representative has confirmed the existence of such a project, even if underselling it a bit - passing it off as just one of many concepts Google is experimenting with internally. According to other familiar sources, however, the new application/platform was originally being groomed for a release at this year's Google I/O, between May 17 and May 19. This was the venue Google used to unveil Allo and Duo last year. Regardless of any initial schedules, there is currently no release estimate for the photo collaboration app. Also, many have already cited Apple's upcoming Clip application as a possible cog in Google's plans. However, that sounds a bit too speculative for our taste.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Will Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, Mi Note 3, Mi 4, Mi Max get Android 7.0 Nougat update before Android O launch? Several OEMs have released Android 7.0 Nougat to their devices but Xiaomi took more time than expected in seeding the firmware. Raymond Ronamai   March 26, 2017 01:00 IST Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 32GB, 16GB variants available online after facing stock issuesIBTimes India Xiaomi's journey in the smartphone industry has been dream-like, becoming one of the world's top mobile phone makers in just a few years. It changed the scenario of the industry by making its handsets available at an aggressive pricing despite impressive features. However, it has failed terribly in one department, and that is software update. Several OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) have released Google's latest operating system Android 7.0 Nougat to their popular devices months ago but Xiaomi took more time than expected in seeding the firmware. The Chinese technology giant finally rolled out Android 7.0 Nougat-based MIUI 8.2 update to its Mi 5 recently after months of waiting but there are still a long line of handsets that are yet to get it. Also read: Xiaomi Mi 5 gets Android 7.0 Nougat update Xiaomi is expected to seed the Android 7.0 Nougat update to more than a dozen devices like Mi 5s Plus, Mi 5s, Mi 5, Mi 4, Mi 4s, Mi 4c, Mi Max, Redmi Pro, Mi Note Pro, Redmi Note 4, Redmi Note 3, Redmi 4, Redmi 4 Prime, Redmi 4A, Redmi 3, Redmi 3A, Redmi 3s, Redmi 3s Prime, Mi Note 2, Mi Pad 2, and Mi 4i. But the question is whether the firmware rollout will happen before the launch of Google's upcoming firmware Android O. Google has released Android O developer preview and it is currently available for download for select devices namely desktop emulator, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL and Pixel C devices. Its public beta is expected to be unveiled at the upcoming Google I/O event from May 17 to 19. And it may not take long before the firmware is released to Google Nexus device, then other OEMs should follow. Going by the pace at which Xiaomi has been seeding new firmware to its devices, it appears like most of its eligible handsets will receive the Android 7.0 Nougat update later than expected, and perhaps even after the unveiling of Android O.

But it isn’t,” he said at Google’s annual advertising show. “YouTube talks back. It’s interactive. And YouTube is everywhere.”   Kyncl’s message resonated with advertisers. Gross ad revenue at YouTube soared from roughly $4 billion in 2013 to $11 billion last year, brokerage firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co estimates. At the same event in 2016, Chief Executive Officer Susan Wojcicki boasted about taking ad dollars from traditional TV networks.   Yet now the same traits Kyncl said made YouTube better than TV have plunged the video service into crisis. Some of the world’s largest advertisers, from Verizon Communications to Johnson & Johnson, stopped spending on YouTube because of concern their ads could appear next to offensive videos. More big companies pulled back on Friday, including PepsiCo, Starbucks and Wal-Mart Stores. This week, $26 billion was knocked off parent company Alphabet’s market value.   “I’ve always been suspect of advertising on YouTube. There’s not really great content in there,” said Rob Griffin, chief innovation officer at marketing agency Almighty. “This will dent their long-term prospect of making YouTube an alternative to TV.”   While the shift to online video viewing favours YouTube, it is scrambling to reassure companies and ad agencies they’ve made the right decision to spend money on the site, and convince them YouTube will protect their ads from offensive material in the future.   Google attempted to curb the controversy Monday, pledging publicly to roll out new controls for marketers. In a memo sent to partners later in the week, Google described more detailed changes, including a new video verification process, long sought by advertisers, and a staff hotline dedicated to brand safety. Another feature Google promised will use machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to flag suspect videos. The new approach would now yank ads if offensive language appeared on a T-shirt in a video, for instance, something that didn’t happen before, according to the memo.   Google aims to implement most of the changes by Sunday, according to the memo. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment.   Even if the company meets that deadline, it may struggle to solve the issue. While TV companies have almost total control over what appears on a given channel, creating a safe space for brands, YouTube opens itself up to anyone who wants to post a video. Advertisers often buy ads across the whole site, or large groups of popular videos, instead of buying ads for a specific channel. The company has safeguards to block offensive content, but the volume of video being uploaded is too great to identify every infringing video.   YouTube warned as much in its memo. Forthcoming changes “should give [advertisers] confidence that their ads will not appear against inappropriate content,” the memo read, “albeit with the volume of content involved this can never be 100 per cent guaranteed.”   Advertisers are now urging Google to let outside companies track issues like safe content, measurement and fraudulent ads on YouTube, according to David Cohen, North American president for Magna Global. In its memo to advertisers this week, Google said it will offer detailed reporting at the level of specific videos and YouTube channels. Google also said in the memo that YouTube customers will able to hire “vendors to verify the safety” of ad placements.   Read More On Youtube | Google | Robert Kyncl | Technology | Apps PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements YouTube's better-than-TV pitch undermined by offensive video Google has attempted to curb the controversy by pledging publicly to roll out new controls Google has attempted to curb the controversy by pledging publicly to roll out new controls Four years ago, Robert Kyncl, YouTube’s business lead, confessed a mistake. “I thought that YouTube was like TV.

In fact, Apple ranked seventh in the top twelve in the 'Internet and Mobile' sector of the report. The report grades transparency, not just conduct and overall wasn't complementary of any of the twenty-two firms when it came to defending your freedom of speech and privacy.   On Thursday the Ranking Digital Rights launched its 2017 Corporate Accountability Index which ranks 22 of the world's most powerful telecommunications, internet and mobile companies that disclosed commitments and policies affecting user's freedom of expression and privacy.   The company noted that "People around the world increasingly rely on the internet and digitally networked devices in all aspects of their lives. But do we have a global information ecosystem in which future generations' rights can be respected? Unfortunately, the answer is 'no.'   Findings showed that companies did not disclose enough information about policies affecting users' rights—and as a result most of the world's internet users lack the information they need to make informed choices.   Project director Rebecca MacKinnon stated that "There is tremendous room for improvement by all companies.' despite positive steps by some companies since organization released its inaugural Index in 2015. Only two companies—Google and Microsoft—scored more than 60 percent on this year's Index, with the remaining evaluated receiving failing grades.   Findings showed that Apple's iOS, Google's Android, and Samsung's implementation of Android all offered poor disclosure of policies affecting users' freedom of expression and privacy. This is a particular concern given that most of the world's new internet users are coming online with smartphones.   The report further noted that "It is possible that both Apple and Samsung may have internal policies and practices aimed at protecting users' freedom of expression and privacy that they do not formally disclose to the public. However the Index only gives credit for policies that are publicly accessible and presented in a company's policy documents. We take this approach as a way to encourage companies to formalize their commitments into policy so that users can make informed decisions about the products and services they use.   Leading executives at Apple for instance have made numerous statements in the media about the company's commitments to privacy and security—and the consensus in the technical community is that Apple's products are the most secure on the market. However its commitments in this regard were not always clearly specified in the policy documents evaluated for this Index.   In respect to online stores, the report noted that "The Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Samsung Galaxy Apps store are chokepoints for freedom of expression. All three mobile ecosystems failed to sufficiently disclose policies affecting users' freedom of expression. While Google's Android disclosed more than its peers, no company provided enough information to enable app users and app developers to fully understand what kinds of content can be created and shared, what types of activities are prohibited, or the consequences for violating these rules."   For the record, 'Ranking Digital Rights' (RDR) is a non-profit research initiative working with an international network of partners to promote greater respect for freedom of expression and privacy rights among information communications technology companies. The study is in line with the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.   To learn more about the full Ranking Digital Rights report click here.   While our report focused on the main parts relating to Apple, the full report actually expands to cover 10 additional companies in the telecom sector that may interest some. For sure the study will be lacking in that space due to the ruling by the U.S. Senate this week that rolls back an FCC rule that required internet-service providers to obtain customers permission before selling their information to third parties.   Now for the Punch Line   Update: If you're scratching your head as to how Google is being praised as the leader in Digital Rights and privacy, there could be a clear reason for that.  A 2015 report by the U.K. tech site called 'The Register' claims that Eric Schmidt is behind the foundation writing the report.   According to The Register: " Just fancy that! A Washington think tank chaired by Eric Schmidt, Alphabet Inc’s executive chairman, has given Alphabet Inc. an award for "protecting your digital rights”.   Schmidt became executive chairman of the New America Foundation, which had built a strong reputation as a non-partisan and imaginative policy think tank, in 2008.   The following year, the foundation created an “Open Technology Initiative” and the think tank began to march in lockstep with Google’s own policy agenda.   This is called 'policy laundering' – the act of legitimizing a policy, or attempting to seize control of a debate, via third parties. Another useful description is 'carousel propaganda,' coined by blogger Frank Fisher, an analogue of 'carousel fraud.'    This week the foundation trumpeted the first results of its “Ranking Digital Rights” project. Coming up smelling of roses were Google, “the highest ranking internet company”, and Vodafone. The team made a gloomy conclusion: "Nearly half the companies in the Index scored less than 25 per cent, showing a serious deficit of respect for users’ freedom of expression and privacy."   Two years later and Eric Schmidt's "project" continues to provide Google with a resounding win over Apple on Privacy. When Apple's CEO published Apple's position on Privacy, hinting that Google sells your private information, Eric Schmidt basically called Cook a liar. Hiding behind an organization that just happens to give Google a glowing privacy ranking is as sleazy as it gets. I have no understanding how this is even legal.    When Apple's Steve Jobs invited Schmidt to sit on Apple's board, he sat through countless meetings about the iPhone before the iPhone was launched. Never once did he tell Jobs that he had to recuse himself because his company was developing a competing product (Android). Why Apple didn't sue Schmidt on this back then remains a mystery to this day. But Schmidt was sleazy then and the new study noted above shows that he'll go to any length to paint Google the opposite to what it really is. Schmidt fits  the classic definition of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Of course this is my opinion and you could make a judgement on this as you please.    As a second source for this story connecting 'Ranking Digital Rights' to the 'New America Foundation' behind this study is a 2016 report by the U.K.'s Guardian here. Wikipedia also links Schmidt to this foundation as well.   In the end, I'm sure that the findings of Ranking Digital Rights report will raise the ire in Apple fans.

Reuters More On: google Google's ad fiasco could be a boon for TV networks More families of Orlando nightclub victims sue Google Google loses more top advertisers amid placement nightmare Google's ad crisis response shows web is growing up On St. Patrick’s Day, executives at ad buying giant Havas filed into their London offices for another day at work — and discovered some very unpleasant news. Ads that they had paid Google to place across its many digital properties were popping up attached to videos from some of the Internet’s most active hate mongers — including white nationalists such as David Duke, animal-rights extremists and ISIS. They were not happy. One ad, for Oracle and NetSuite, featuring smiling office workers, was displayed prominently on a video of two men carrying an ISIS flag. Another, for Walmart, sat atop a masked man crouching with fierce dogs. While the ad world has long harbored resentment toward Google for its secretive ways, the videos were more than Havas could stomach. Havas’ UK boss, Paul Frampton, immediately yanked all of his clients’ commercials from the web giant. “We have a duty of care to our clients in the UK marketplace . . . where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands’ objectives,” Frampton said in a statement. Days later, Google apologized and promised to fix the problem — but it wasn’t enough. Within a week, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, Wal-mart, General Motors, Starbucks, Verizon, JPMorgan Chase and other mega-advertisers had followed suit, pulling their ads from Google’s platforms in the US. YouTube It was a moment of reckoning for Google. After years of happily banking ever-expanding ad budgets, the world’s second-biggest company was on notice. Google, the search engine, and its subsidiaries like YouTube have always insisted that they are simply a platform that serves content or ads. But suddenly that excuse wasn’t cutting it anymore. Outrage arose after ads appeared alongside videos pushing animal-rights extremism (top) and anti-Semitism (above).YouTube “They’ve always maintained they were sort of digital engineers standing there with their digital [wrenches], trying to tighten the nuts on their digital pipes and not being responsible for the content that was going through the pipes,” Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP Group, the biggest advertiser in the world with $102 billion in client ad money, said on CNBC. But after the Havas snafu, “They can’t just say, ‘Look, we’re a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages.’ ” In fact, many industry leaders are now charging that Google and other tech giants, like Facebook, aren’t just web platforms; they’re publishers — like a news organization or a TV network — and they must shoulder the responsibility that comes with that role. “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” Sorrell said. With brands including Google Maps and its Gmail service, Google has a market cap of $562.4 billion and it controls 41 percent of the $83 billion US digital ad market. (Facebook controls 14.7 percent of the US digital ad business, according to eMarketer.) But its once-impenetrable brand equity is now in danger of evaporating, at least with a growing band of major advertisers. They can’t just say, ‘Look, we’re a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages.’ Traditionally, marketers spend considerable time and energy ensuring media outlets don’t run their ads next to clashing content. Fast-food ads, for example, are expected not to run alongside stories about dieting or diabetes. Airlines typically tell TV news outlets to drop their ads from breaks when plane crashes are reported. But online? It’s a whole other story. There are few checks and balances. Google argues it can never guarantee where ads land, because it’s contending with 400 hours of content uploaded every minute. Google also operates YouTube, one of the biggest destinations online offering advertisers a billion hours of viewing content per day, and a global ad exchange called DoubleClick, which automatically serves up ads on millions of websites all over the world. Because of its size and dominance, for a long time Google called the shots. While other, less-important outlets were forced to provide advertisers with data that showed whether or not their online campaigns were effective, Google has long refused to share those metrics. The company’s algorithm, which it uses to filter out unsavory content when placing ads, is also secret. But now it’s also clear it doesn’t work. The Times of London was the first to reveal Google’s glitch, with an investigation earlier this month exposing the Havas problem and setting off the advertising boycott. Google’s response to the Times of London’s findings only seemed to compound the problem. On Monday, Google’s European chief, Matt Brittin, told advertisers at a conference that the company already had the tools to keep their ads off bad content, they just weren’t using them correctly. He added that Google would step in to help them figure it out and claimed that 98 percent of flagged content is reviewed within 24 hours. Google’s European chief, Matt Brittin.Getty Images (But after flagging several bad ad placements to Google that weren’t rectified within the 24 hour period, the Times of London proved this wasn’t entirely true.) By Tuesday, Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, in a blog post, pledged to do more: “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So, starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content,” he wrote. “In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn’t have been, we plan to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues.” Meanwhile, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has been unable to promise a zero-tolerance policy. Appearing on Fox Business on Thursday, Schmidt stated that while Google “can get pretty close” to making sure ads won’t appear next to extremist content, he can’t guarantee it. And now the damage may be too big to contain. In May, big digital players including Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and AOL/Yahoo will start pitching their business as part of the “Digital New Fronts” — where marketers aiming to advertise the upcoming TV season commit the majority of their budgets to web outlets. In the coming weeks, as Google hopes to grab TV ad budgets, execs will likely be spending most of their time discussing issues of brand safety, notes Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. Advertisers spend about $70 billion on TV ads in the US, and Wieser estimates Google could lose as much as $1 billion in new ad money as a result of the boycott and its aftermath. “Google’s stated solution was late and woeful. Given numerous opportunities to nip it in the bud, they’ve seemingly made it worse.” Wieser said Google is “attempting to minimize the problem rather than eliminating it. We think that Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero-tolerance policy, to alleviate concerns before it can fully recover.” On Monday, Wieser showed his lack of confidence in Google stock, downgrading Alphabet from a buy to a hold. By Friday, Alphabet stock was $814.43, losing $35 per share in a week. While Google has allowed hate-speech content to run riot on its platforms, it is also accused of restricting ad funds to legitimate websites. Israel-based Matan Uziel runs a serious documentary series on YouTube featuring women discussing rape and abuse. It includes, among other subjects, ex-models discussing how they became bulimic working in the fashion business. He says his organization supports Emma Watson’s UN initiative, “HeForShe.” Uziel says Google served ads to his channel on YouTube until December, when suddenly the company halted the flow. Uziel says he’s complained to YouTube that his female-empowerment series has been prevented from monetizing the clips in the “Real Women, Real Stories,” online series. He pointed out that videos glorifying drugs and showing self-harm are able to monetize their ads, perhaps because the content of the ads isn’t so obvious to Google’s algorithm. He says he has called on YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki to address the problem but got no response. “It is a dark time in the US for women,” Uziel said. “Google owns YouTube and, like any multinational tech company, they are supposedly acting in their own best interests. But they are undermining their creators.” (Google declined to comment on Uziel’s claims.) Getty Images Stunned by the volume of complaints from major advertisers, on Friday Google issued a client memo detailing the changes it is making. The firm is promising to use a new type of artificial intelligence to flag inappropriate content that will even pick up a T-shirt bearing bad language, according to Bloomberg, which obtained the memo. It will also retool a video verification process and create a staff hotline to respond to complaints. Google said it would implement changes by Sunday. But some are saying Google needs to go even further, hiring actual human editors who can judge the nuances of content more effectively than an automated system. Google’s many rivals in the space, including AppNexus and AOL’s Marketplace, note that they have much tighter policies on what’s acceptable. “They need to hire more data scientists,” said one digital ad executive. Critics say Google, which was cooked up nearly 20 years ago in a Menlo Park, Calif., garage by two college kids, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is finally having to grow up, take responsibility for its content and deal with the issues that old-school publishers have long had to face. “It’s a shame it took this kind of a pressure,” one digital advertising executive told The Post. Jon Bond, a veteran ad exec who works with In-N-Out Burger as co-chairman of ad agency holding company Shipyard, added that technology companies’ insensitivity to people is a huge weak point. “Google isn’t about people, and that’s going to bite them,” Bond told The Post. “They’ve never had to go to a meeting where something inappropriate got blown up by the press and consumers wrote letters to the CEO.” He said Google needs to fine-tune its artificial intelligence so that it has more of a human touch. “It’s impossible to be perfect. People aren’t perfect in the print world. But there is an acceptable range and they have to get closer to where the publishing world is — where it’s humans making decisions.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under advertising ,  anti-semitism ,  digital publishing ,  google ,  youtube Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Google loses more top advertisers amid placement nightmare Read Next Google loses more top advertisers amid placement nightmare Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 139,134 Schumer loses cool with Trump supporter at swanky restaurant 104,346 The New York Times' ongoing dishonesty only helps Trump 92,749 'One word' sparks ridiculous infighting at ESPN Now On This is the worst David Beckham has ever looked Who should play Barbie in the live-action movie Nancy Kerrigan has moved past Tonya Harding — even if the world hasn’t SEE ALL Video 0:47 Comic book nerds fell into a pool, and looked amazing doing it Now On 10 Sex Scenes That Changed Film History SEE ALL More Stories pagesix Schumer loses cool with Trump supporter at swanky restaurant Now On Decider Alec Baldwin's First Thought When Meeting Tina Fey: "Is She Single?" nypost The New York Times' ongoing dishonesty only helps Trump New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  Google Announces Retirement of IM Service Google Talk Google Announces Retirement of IM Service Google Talk Posted by Ken Brown | Sat, Mar 25, 2017 - 12:30 PM Google has announced that their free messaging service, Google Talk, will be “fully transitioned” to Hangouts and officially retired. Google Talk was launched in 2005 as a simple device to help Gmail users chat among themselves. In 2013 Google introduced Hangouts which offered improvements over Google Talk such as advanced group video calling and was able to integrate seamlessly to with other Google products. Now the company will no longer support both apps and is ‘encouraging’ users of Google Talk to move and adopt Hangout with open arms. According to Google, contacts should migrate over automatically with very little change in the user experience. There are some that might be sad that they will not have the ability to use beloved “Gchat” anymore but more than likely, users will just star using Hangouts. Probably the most alarming change to the scores of Google Talk users was the announcement that Google will be killing their very popular Google Talk for Android application making it no longer functional. Google Hangouts will also undergo some changes and will be losing its SMS support. This function will be added to Android Messages which is scheduled to receive features like, “read receipts, group chat, hi-res photo sharing and more,” sometime in the near future. Here is a partial list from Google’s G Suite Team on the other “streamlined updates” that will be introduced: Upgrading Google SMS to Android Messages XMPP federation with third-party services providers no longer supported Legacy Google Talk Android app (introduced in 2013) to stop functioning Retiring several Gmail Labs and Google+ functionality in Gmail Google will be informing Talk users that the Google Talk service – and the other functions listed above – will not be available after June 26. Google encourages users to subscribe to the G Suite What’s New Calendar to monitor retirement dates for these and other user features.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Wednesday March 29, 2017 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Lumia 650 proves that 'Windows Phone' is dead Campbell Simpson 23 May 2016, 1:45 p.m. Microsoft shifts its strategy in a market dominated by Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Lumia 650 proves that 'Windows Phone' is dead The Lumia 650 is a phone from Microsoft, but it isn't being sold as a 'Windows Phone'. Photo: Microsoft Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Search for the phrase "Windows phone" in Microsoft's announcement of the new Lumia 650 and you'll find... nothing. Sure, it's a Windows phone, but Microsoft has well and truly decided to go all-in on its strategy of aligning its powerful Windows 10 tablet and laptop and desktop devices with the lower-powered Windows 10 Mobile platform to attract customers. The Lumia 650 looks like a hell of a lot of phone for $299, and there's no doubt that Microsoft will sell quite a few to business customers that want the best possible integration with Microsoft services like OneDrive and Office apps like Word and Excel. But the phone, also sold at Australia Post and Big W and JB Hi-Fi, isn't being sold as a Windows phone, and it's not even necessarily being sold as a phone running Windows 10 Mobile. That's fine, of course, but it points to an interesting strategy — in a market where Apple phones proudly tout their iOS credentials, and Google shouts Android from the rooftops, Microsoft is gambling that smartphone buyers don't care so much about what OS their phone as running as what it does. Windows 10 Mobile still has an apps problem, and that's not going to change any time soon. It's hard to get developers to spend time customising apps for Windows 10 Mobile when only 3.7 per cent of the smartphones sold within Australia in the last three months run Windows — and that's a 50 per cent drop from the same time last year. But Microsoft does its first-party apps so well, people know and like Outlook and Word, and that's what the company is selling its Windows phones with. And Windows 10 Mobile has two excellent ideas in it that do deserve plenty of praise. Continuum has within it the start of an amazing idea, too — it's a legitimate glimpse into a future where we only have a single device that functions both as a handheld terminal and a desktop productivity tool. It's not perfect on the Lumia 950, but as the first demonstration of a piece of software that might just be the Next Big Thing it's pretty impressive. Microsoft's Continuum, I think, will be the genesis of future services from both Apple and Google, if not Microsoft alone, and that's proof of its value. Hello, too, makes signing into your phone even easier — and more secure — than using a fingerprint. It's as close to a perfect sign-in as I've had on any mobile device — it's more consistent than even the best fingerprint sensors, it works in the dark, and it works from a distance without you having to touch your phone. And it works exactly the same as it does on Microsoft's Surface Pro and Surface Book PC hardware; that's the big selling point of Windows. That needs to happen just a little bit more, and then Microsoft will have us living in the future. Bring desktop Windows apps to smartphones, or make smartphones run Windows So 'Windows phone' is dead — but that's not a big deal. When smartphones get a little more powerful than the Lumia 950, and a little more mature than Windows 10 Mobile is right now, the Windows Everywhere philosophy will ring true. It's already happening with Xbox — the Windows 10 Anniversary update of later this year will mean that the Xbox One will be able to run many of the same 'apps' as desktop Windows. Universal Windows apps— and devices — are the future. The death of 'Windows phone' as a phrase and a marketing term is just one small step along that path. Explore the smart design, breakthrough science and awe-inspiring tech shaping your future at Gizmodo Australia.

Doc Portrait PDF Landscape PDF Doc EMail Share Facebook Twitter Available to Premium & Purple Members In a conversation with Nest, we discuss the the risks, benefits and future of home automation Matt Vitone 24 march 2017 For as long as humans have known the concept, home has been a space that protects us from harmful external elements, that nourishes our minds and bodies and readies us for the inevitable return to the reaches outside the home. In many ways, home automation is the technological next step towards making the places we live safer and more comfortable. Homes that can anticipate our needs—from how we like the lights, to what temperature our bedrooms should be in the morning—take the thinking out of the mundane and free us to pursue more important work. But these technological shortcuts raise as many issues as they solve. From baby cams to security systems, connected devices are ripe targets for hackers. Products like Amazon Echo—with its microphone that records what it hears—tow the line between convenience and a certain sense of Big Brother. In an ongoing Arkansas case where a man stands accused of murdering his friend, Amazon was recently forced to hand over audio recordings of the alleged killing, raising questions about the privacy of smart home devices, and the responsibilities of the companies that are increasingly keeping more of our data. Alphabet-owned Nest, acquired by Google in 2014, is another major player in the home automation space. In the seven short years since its founding in 2010, the company has attempted to push the idea of the connected home further with a string of products including its Nest Learning Thermostat, Nest Protect—a combination smoke and carbon monoxide detector—and Nest Cam, a security camera with a slew of features that works both indoors and out. With the launch of the Google Home speaker last year (which is compatable with Nest products) Alphabet further expanded its home ecosystem, and by extension the way people think about what a home aught to do. PSFK recently chatted with Maxime Veron, Nest director of product marketing, on some of the biggest issues surrounding home automation—including privacy—as well as where the category as a whole is headed next. How have you seen the idea of a connected home evolve over the years? From either a technological or ideological perspective? That’s a good question. The concept of connected home isn’t new, right? It started in the late ’70s. There was a protocol called X10, and it was meant to allow you to program some devices and then you could trigger activators to turn things on and off. What’s interesting is that when you fast-forward to 2017, a lot of people in this space are still basically doing the same thing; things that just turn on and off, things you still need to program yourself. When we started Nest, the goal for us was to make sure that you actually didn’t have to program your thermostat right away if you didn’t want to. That’s why we created the Learning Thermostat. From an ideological point of view, the shift there is really that we believe that new products should be there for you, and should do more for you than you have to do for them. It seems there are more connected products on the market now than ever before. How does Nest stand out from its competitors? And how do these differences tie into the idea you just mentioned; that products should work for the consumer, rather than the other way around? If you look at other [competitors] on the market, like SmartThings, for instance, they’re good for people who do want to program things, who do want to spend time setting a mood, who do want to spend time trying to understand their triggers and actions. Our products work very differently. The way we’ve approached it is really solving one problem at a time with one great product at a time. Once you have multiple products in your home, they start talking to each other automatically. For instance your Nest Protect, smoke and carbon monoxide alarm will turn off your HVAC, your heating, or cooling fan if it detects high levels of smoke to prevent bringing new fresh air to your home. If it detects high levels of carbon monoxide it will turn off your heating because that’s one of the most common reasons why you might have carbon monoxide poisoning in your home. At the same time, it will turn on your camera just in case something really is happening and you want to have a clip to go back to, to see what happened. All these things happen automatically as soon as you have set up these devices in your home. You don’t have to turn anything on, and you don’t have to create any rule. Do you think that there’s a limit to how much people trust connected objects, or further than that—artificial intelligence—to have access to their homes? Is there any sort of privacy or security concern? Oh, yeah. That’s a great question. Actually, I would argue that it starts not even with artificial intelligence, but just the connected object. Like, do you trust that this—let’s just take as an example—that this camera is going to not spy on you, basically? That thinking was [considered] from the beginning—from the first development boards of every single one of our products. Security and privacy go together. If you don’t have any security on your product then you don’t have any privacy, because everybody can look at your data. There have been several stories for instance of baby cams being hacked and videos of babies’ bedrooms being found on the web as an open stream. Just a few months ago, connected video cameras and other connected devices in the home were being used again on some websites. So how does Nest protect its customers from being spied on? Today, customers choose a connected product for their home based mainly on feature and price. We believe that, over time, the third pillar there, the third criteria, will be security. Our products don’t ship, for instance, with a default login and password. To connect our Nest product to the Internet, you have to create your account. You verify your email address. You have to create a password that’s secure. It can’t be just ‘1234.’ Then you have two-factor authentication that happens to make sure that the product you are trying to setup is the one you actually have in your hand. We make all of this as easy as we can through the app. What if any ethical dilemmas surround AI-assisted technology? In home products or otherwise? Well take, for instance, this thing about parallel foresight with automatic or self-driving cars. I for one think that 20 years from now, maybe humans will be prevented from driving a car in some parts of the country or in some countries around the world. As in, it will be illegal for a human to drive, because it will be so much safer for a machine to do it on their behalf. But in the meantime, you have the dilemma of if the car is driving you, and then the car has to make a choice between you and saving the pedestrian who is crossing just in front of you illegally, and the car maybe doesn’t have time to stop—what does it do? Big dilemma. That, to me, is an example of how artificial intelligence will have its limits, for sure. Thankfully for the home, these problems—at least so far—haven’t been that dramatic. How has AI been used in Nest products, and how does the technology benefit consumers outside of the initial wow-factor of having a thermostat that knows what temperature you like the house to be at? We’ve been using [artificial intelligence] in our products to do things like enabling the thermostat to learn from your temperature [preferences] to create a schedule for you. It’s pretty benign in terms of potential issues and trust. But it’s also very positive for customers, because it saves them energy, and saves them money. You turn the temperature up or down for the first three or four days and if you have Nest Thermostat in your home it creates a schedule. It’s been proven to save energy through independent studies, which show that you save 10 to 12 percent on your heating bill and 15 percent on your cooling bill. This is a great way to use artificial intelligence to provide value to customers that has almost no negative impact. So would you say consumers generally trust AI, once they see the benefits? In terms of trust, so far we haven’t seen anything that shows that customers are not trusting, or not willing to trust, artificial intelligence in their home. One of the key questions that we all had when Amazon’s Alexa launched was, “Would people be willing to put a device in their home that has a mic always on?” The success from Amazon and now, Google Home, has shown us that yes, people actually are willing and ready to do that. As you know, in high tech, like in many other markets, it’s always a tradeoff between what you’re willing to give up versus the benefit you get from it. You give up your credit card information, sometimes on the phone to book travel, because that will make sure that you don’t have to wait to get a bill, and pay by check, for instance. You just gave your credit card number to someone. Who knows what they’re going to do with it? So far, the tradeoff seems to be in favor of artificial intelligence. But I would not take it from me. Have you heard of cases that don’t match this analysis? I think you’re right-on in terms of where the trends are going. People are becoming more comfortable with giving up bits of their privacy for convenience. I also think the definition of what’s considered “private” information is changing too. I, for one, know that I’m much more comfortable giving away my information to companies than my parents are. So it raises a whole bunch of interesting questions. Definitely, and you’re right about the generational gap there, and whether I like it or not I’m in my 40s and I’m much more open to giving up privacy to gain something back than some other people in my family, for sure. With that in mind, who would you say is the Nest customer and what are they looking for? Two of them that come to mind: early tech adopters who want the latest and greatest, and savings-conscious consumers, for who it’s more about the cost benefits than the technology itself. The second group will buy the Nest Thermostat first and foremost because it’s proven to save them energy. In fact, we’re the first Energy Star rated thermostat. Then they will buy the Nest Protect because it’s a great smoke alarm and it also has a carbon monoxide alarm. They’ll buy the Nest Cam because it will help them sleep better at night. For the first group, they’re very design-oriented and they want something that stands out. That’s why we just released three additional color rings for Nest Thermostat. We now have copper, black, and white in addition to stainless steel, and so they really like the look of something that’s different from their neighbors or friends. How important then is good design? How much thought and consideration goes into each product? Design is critical. And design for us doesn’t just mean industrial design, the way it looks. Design is how it behaves, how you can use it, how easy is it to install. We look at these holistically. The hardware design is key. You want to make sure that customers are happy and want to buy your product. But the way you use it is important—if you have a beautiful thing that is very hard to use, it becomes a doorstop. One of the key reasons why people embraced the Nest Thermostat five years ago was because it was just the best programmable thermostat—other programmable thermostats were so hard to use. We offer customers something to lust after from a design standpoint, but when they get it home it’s something that’s easy to install and use. I’m sure you can’t mention any products that are in development [the company is reported to be working on a home security system and a smart doorbell], but generally speaking, are there any technologies or innovations that excite you personally and that you’re excited to see developed in the future? One thing I can tell you has to do with the intelligence alert that we have on our camera, thanks to our close collaboration with Google. We’re using their algorithm tailored for our use for a stationary camera inside or outside your home to detect people, to detect the door. There are so many other things that can be detected in your home or outside your home that intelligence could alert you about that would be very, very exciting over the next few months and years. Yeah. I can just imagine a camera that could, say, distinguish your neighbor from a delivery person, or a burglar. All these are great example because it also speaks to the questions you were asking earlier about AI. That is a great benefit of AI. It’s like having a security guard looking at your home 24/7. Not just looking and pressing a red button every time something moves, but being able to know what to alert you about. Hopefully as the technology develops it becomes enmeshed in the home to the point where you don’t necessarily think about them as being separate objects, everything will just work in harmony. I’m with you there. We’re working closely with Google to make sure we bring more intelligence to all of our products and create that platform that I was telling you about, but also making sure that [every product] speaks to each other very easily. Our platforms are actually now one-in-the-same. There’s one team at Alphabet that takes care of IoT for Alphabet, for Nest, for Google and more, so I know that Google tries to do exactly what you’re talking about. What is your idea of home? For me, at least, the modern home is a home that enables me to basically have all these devices working together to do what I want them to do. The key piece to that is actually how many remotes. A remote control that I can use and, if I press one button, it turns on my TV, it turns off my music, it dims my lights and can even turn down my thermostat. For some people it might be a vocal command. What I hope happens in the future is that thanks to AI and sensors, you don’t even have to say or do anything for these things to happen. The home should be able to do that for you. To me the key thing is to make sure I don’t have to take care of my home as much as it can take care of me. The ultimate goal in the future then is something that will actually be seamlessly live, so that I don’t have to think about it and I can focus on the important things. I could focus on feeding my kids, driving them to school, going on a night out with my wife, making sure my family and my home are safe. So really being able to enjoy the moment more because my home can take care of itself and because my home can let me know when something is wrong. How close are we to that being a reality? We’re getting there. At Nest, we have a unique calling which is to take care of these big, important problems for you. From an analytical point of view, this is really for us a stepping-stone on the path to what we call, internally and externally as well, the conscious home, the thoughtful home. The thoughtful home, for us, is really a home that can take care of people inside the home, and also the world around it by saving lives, by saving energy, and making a better world for everyone out there.

Hot Topics: New Lowell High School Spring Home & Garden 'Be a Volunteer' series Trump Transition Marijuana News Opiate Abuse More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott The Lowell Sun Updated:   03/25/2017 09:59:29 AM EDT FILE - This March 18, 2010, file photo shows the YouTube website in Los Angeles. An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening in a sign of the skepticism surrounding Googleâ s promise to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Dish Network became the latest companies to suspend their advertising on YouTube after The Wall Street Journal found Googleâ s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. Even though the defections are continuing, most analysts arenâ t worried yet. Starbucks and General Motors also joined in the YouTube boycott Friday, March 24, 2017. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File) (Richard Vogel) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. Advertisement As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube -- an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is "laser-focused" on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. ------ AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this story.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals General Google Maps Is Now Going To Allow Users To Share Their Location With A Few People For A Selected Time Interval By Zarmeen Shahzad Mar 22, 2017 21Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Maps is bringing out a new feature that will allow users to have a little more control over their privacy. This new feature will let Android and iOS users to share their real-time location with friends and family in a controlled manner. What does this mean? Well it simply means that once this feature is rolled out you will be able to choose who you want to share your location with and for how long. The interval can vary from 15 minutes to 3 days.

You can share your location with anyone on Android, iPhone and mobile/ desktop browsers. Advertisement An added feature is that you will be able to stop the real-time location sharing at any moment, even before the timer expires. An icon, above the compass on your screen will remind you that who has access to your location. This sharing can also be done from the turn-by-turn navigation screen. If you use the feature this way, then sharing will end automatically when you reach your desired destination. Google-owned Waze app already has similar features. Google’s new Trusted Contacts app also allows real-time location sharing. However, in Google Maps other than the real-time location sharing, limiting the time this location is shared is an added feature. Related Google Maps Becomes Social With Launch Of User-Created Shareable ‘Lists’ Feature In the past few weeks Google has been working on improving Google Maps a lot. A lot of functions have been added like useful parking spot reminders and sharing favorite local spots with friends.

It’s been an action-packed week across the tech world, filled with exciting news, spicy rumors, and one or two surprises. But don’t worry if you’ve struggled to keep up with it all – 7 Days is here again to walk you through what’s been happening, and bring you up to speed. Our global tech odyssey begins this week with WikiLeaks, which contacted major tech companies including Apple, Microsoft and Google, offering to work with them in patching exploits used by the CIA, revealed in its recent 'Vault7' leaks. However, WikiLeaks attached certain conditions to its offer of cooperation - and since then, those companies have not responded favorably to the organization's requests. In an unsettling move, the US Senate voted to allow internet service providers to share and sell users' browsing histories without their explicit permission. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, a judge granted a warrant to a local police department requiring that Google provide the personal details of literally anyone, anywhere, who looked for a specific name using its search engine. Google apologized earlier this week after YouTube's 'Restricted Mode' - which is intended to filter out inappropriate content for certain users - began indiscriminately blocking videos from the LGBTQ+ community, without explanation. The company apologized, and later said that the feature "isn't working the way it should", promising to fix it. Over on the Google Play Store, a mystery has been brewing. WhatsApp recently received a flood of thousands of five-star reviews on the store - but they refer to the app as a "game", and describe how the reviewers "enjoyed the gameplay", which certainly raises some questions. Speaking of five-star reviews, Netflix is dropping its star-based ratings system in favor of a simpler thumbs-up/thumbs-down method for rating its shows and movies. Qualcomm announced its new 205 Processor Mobile Platform, a dual-core chipset that will bring 4G LTE to affordable feature phones. British telecommunications giant Vodafone is joining forces with Idea, one of India's top mobile operators, to form the country's largest carrier, with almost 400 million customers, and around 40% of the nation's mobile revenue. It also seems that Apple is preparing to start manufacturing iPhones in India. However, over in New Zealand, Apple has come under fire for having sold $4.2 billion (NZD) worth of products in the country since 2007, but paying no taxes there at all. Tuesday was a big day for Apple as it made a series of product announcements. It launched new (PRODUCT)RED special editions of its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, contributing to the fight against the spread and the effects of HIV/AIDS. Aside from the rather striking new lick of paint, though, they're technically identical to the 'standard' iPhone 7 models that it launched last year. It also doubled the storage of its iPhone SE range at no extra cost, finally eliminating the scourge of the 16GB iPhone from its line-up. And it brought an end to its 9.7-inch iPad Air range, replacing it with a much cheaper 9.7-inch tablet, simply branded "iPad", and starting at $329. It also ditched the iPad mini 2, and doubled the mini 4's storage. Huawei released an update for its Mate 9 handset to enable Amazon's digital voice assistant, Alexa, allowing users to control smart home devices and more. Sony unexpectedly announced the Xperia L1, with a 5.5-inch display and Android 7.0 Nougat. But even more expected was an announcement from VAIO, which of course used to be owned by Sony. A year after launching the Phone Biz with Windows 10 Mobile, VAIO announced the Phone A, with virtually identical (and now somewhat outdated) specs, and running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow (!!), which was originally released in December 2015. HMD Global said that its Nokia 3, 5 and 6 Android smartphones will be made available in the US, as part of plans for a simultaneous launch of its devices in 120 markets in Q2 2017, which it described as "ambitious". That is something of an understatement. Details of Samsung's new Galaxy S8 flagship continued to emerge in recent days: Performance benchmarks hint at fierce performance for Galaxy S8 Samsung announces Bixby, its new digital assistant, launching on the Galaxy S8 Screen resolution options Samsung's upcoming DeX desktop docking station for the S8 may include active cooling fans Samsung releases UNPACKED 2017 app ahead of launch event Galaxy S8 may be smaller than the Galaxy S7 edge The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on T-Mobile, and the LG V10 and G5 on AT&T, all received Google's latest security updates for Android this week. Google published its Android Security report for 2016, acknowledging that "there's still a lot of room for improvement" in how devices are updated, but insists that it's made good progress, and will continue to do so. Seven months after Android 7.0 was released, Nougat is now installed on just 2.8% of active Android devices. The Nougat update continues its long, slow rollout, making its way this week to: Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on Rogers and Telus in Canada HTC One M9 on T-Mobile in the US Nextbit Robin Google also released its second beta of Android 7.1.2 for supported devices. But the biggest news of the week on the Google front came as the company revealed details of the next major version of its ubiquitous operating system. On Tuesday, it announced Android O, which will include a wide range of new features and improvements. It also released its first Developer Preview for a handful of devices, and promised a wider beta program in May, ahead of Android O's general release in Q3. You can find out how to install the Developer Preview right now - but it's not recommended for inexperienced users. Also on Tuesday, Microsoft released its latest Insider Preview for the Windows 10 Creators Update, build 15063, to PCs and phones in the Fast ring. A couple of days later, it released the same build to the Slow ring. With the Creators Update due to be released next month, this week's leak of the SDK and Mobile Emulator for build 15063 appeared to confirm that it will be the final 'RTM' build for the new version of Windows 10. Microsoft also released two cumulative updates for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update - the current version of the OS: build 14393.969 on Monday; and 14393.970 on Thursday. In China, Microsoft said that its specialized government-approved version of Windows 10 "is now in a good position" to serve the country's public sector. But in India, there was bad news for Windows phone owners. With just one week's notice, Microsoft is ending its support for carrier billing there. Over in the US, Cricket Wireless briefly offered pre-owned models of the Microsoft Lumia 650 for just $0.99 (yes, that's 99 cents - not a typo) - but it's since removed that listing. Users with older versions of Windows and Windows Phone will no longer be able to access the Microsoft Translator app from next month. Some users will be able to download "new versions" of the app to continue using it - but these changes do not affect Windows 10 devices. It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of Microsoft's near-endless stream of deals on its Surface devices. In the US, it cut $100 off the entry-level Surface Pro 4 without the Surface Pen; and then a few days later, it reduced the price of another model by $200. Over in the UK, literally two minutes after ending one deal, it launched another one, offering up to 24% off select Surface Book and Pro 4 models. Earlier this week, there were five separate deals available on the Surface Pro 4 at the same time in the UK. Nonetheless, the Surface Pro 4 appears to be selling well. According to the latest AdDuplex report, it's the most popular device in Microsoft's range - but HP is the world's biggest Windows 10 PC maker. The US Army has ordered almost 10,000 rugged Windows 10 tablets, including Intel's latest Core processors, and a variety of security features. A company founded by a former Microsoft employee has started a crowdfunding campaign, aiming to launch an 8-inch Windows 10 ultra-mobile PC with an ARM-based Snapdragon 835 processor, 4G LTE, and an integrated keyboard. Priced at up to $750, the company behind the device hopes to launch the Windows 10 model in January 2018, a few months behind the cheaper Android model. Last year, Microsoft shipped the Windows 10 Anniversary Update with an incomplete Skype Preview app. Ahead of the Creators Update, and following months of additions and improvements to the app, the company dropped its 'Preview' tag in the latest version this week. Microsoft Edge was declared the least secure web browser after being hacked more than any of its rivals at the Pwn2Own 2017 hacking event. Google's Chrome browser emerged unscathed. Microsoft said that "security is a process, not a destination", and outlined various improvements in its browser to enhance its security. It also announced that it's bringing support for CSS Custom Properties to Edge in the Creators Update. For the second time in recent weeks, many users found themselves unable to sign in to services using their Microsoft account credentials on Tuesday; the issue affected services such as OneDrive, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, and more. Those login issues didn't exactly provide the ideal build-up to Microsoft's announcement that its Outlook.com Premium mail service is now available in six new markets. LineageOS emerged from the ashes of Cyanogen, offering a new alternative Android-based operating system. The OS has now reached over a million installations, and its development team celebrated by revealing new improvements and adding support for more devices. Cyanogen's Kirt McMaster revealed that Nintendo had approached the company to ask for its help in developing a custom version of Android for the console that it eventually released as the Switch this year. McMaster said he had "told them to stick it". Charming. Nintendo finally acknowledged issues affecting the connectivity of the Joy-Con controllers on its Switch console, following weeks of complaints. It described the problem as a "manufacturing variation", and is offering free repairs for affected controllers. By the way, if you're thinking of buying the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, be sure to check out our unboxing video and gallery. It's been quite a busy week for those on the Xbox Insider Program. On Tuesday, Microsoft released build 15063 - yep, the same number that's virtually certain to be the RTM build for the Creators Update - to the Alpha Ring, followed quickly by the Beta Ring, and Ring 3. A couple of days later, it rolled out build 15063.1003 to the Alpha Ring, before rapidly rolling it out to the Beta Ring and Ring 3 too. It's also released the first Alpha Ring Insider Preview of the Version 1704 update - which will come after the Creators Update. Many of the features in the new 1704 preview were outlined earlier in the week in an official announcement. Microsoft also announced the Wireless Controller Recon Tech Special Edition for the Xbox One and One S. Priced at $69.99, the company said that it's "inspired by military technology", and it's the first in a new 'Tech Series' of Wireless Controllers launching this year. The number of Xbox 360 games supported on the Xbox One through the Backward Compatibility feature rose to more than 350 when Microsoft added three more games on Tuesday, followed by a further three additions on Thursday, including Assassin's Creed Revelations. It was also confirmed this week that an Assassin's Creed TV show is officially in development. Photos purporting to show marketing material for Destiny 2 emerged this Thursday, apparently revealing the game's release date, and confirming an upcoming beta. The long wait for Mass Effect: Andromeda finally came to an end this week, as the game launched on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. Its release had been delayed by several months. But our journey ends this week with the world's most popular plumber, who finally made his way to the world's largest mobile platform. Six months after it was originally announced, and three months after its launch on iOS, Super Mario Run is now available on Android. Better late than never? Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. First up, check out our overview of some of the new features and improvements coming in the Windows 10 Creators Update. Shreyas Gandhe shared his review of the Oukitel U15S, an Android smartphone with 4GB RAM, and 32GB storage and a rather slim design. Impressed? Don't be - Shreyas described the device as "a combination of wrong choices". Timi Cantisano had a Flashback to the Nokia N95, ten years after its release. Times have certainly changed in the tech world since then, but the N95 was quite a remarkable device when it launched a decade ago. If you're feeling in a nostalgic mood, be sure to read the article for a trip down Memory Lane. And finally, after Google announced details of its next major update for Android, we asked our readers what they think the big 'O' in 'Android O' might stand for. Which sweet snack or delicious dessert will it be named after? Join in the discussion and have your say! Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology.

With two of the leaked codenames, Muskie and Walleye, likely pertaining to the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL, speculations are high that the third cryptic device, codenamed Taimen, might be the latest iteration of Google’s powerhouse and best-selling tablet, the Nexus 7. Rumors about the Nexus 7 2017 have been emerging steadily over the past few months. While it seemed for a while that Google might abandon the Nexus brand altogether, the demand for a bang-for-your-buck device with formidable internals remain high. Thus, while quite unorthodox considering the company’s current strategies, there is a pretty good chance that the Nexus 7 2017 might still see the light of day sometime this year. 今月の購入品#ZenFone3Ultra#Nexus7https://t.co/daUGVf8b7o pic.twitter.com/OyoWJe2FdQ — ネコ耳スイッチ (@ak11921) March 20, 2017 Speculations about the Nexus 7 2017 cover a number of aspects about the rumored device. Among the most notable of these predictions state that the upcoming powerhouse budget tablet would not run Android OS at all, according to a MobiPicker report. Instead, the Nexus 7 2017 is expected to run Google’s new Andromeda OS, a robust new operating system that is designed to be compatible with both Android and Chrome OS applications. Considering that the Nexus 7 features a seven-inch display, the new operating system would have a substantial space to showcase its new features. As for the device’s internals, rumors are varying, but speculations are high that Google might opt to equip the Nexus 7 with a powerhouse SoC such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. Other rumors, however, disagree, stating that the Nexus 7 2017, being a budget device, would most likely ship with an older but still robust Snapdragon 821 processor. If the latter is true, this will enable Google to balance the tablet’s power with its affordable price, which is something that fans of the tech giant would definitely appreciate. Speculations are also abounding regarding the other specs of the device. Currently, rumors are high that the Nexus 7 2017 would feature around 4GB of RAM, though some speculations state that the upcoming tablet would feature as much as 6GB of memory, according to a GeekReply report. Internal storage-wise, rumors are high that the device would most likely ship with either 32GB or 64GB of flash storage. A memory card slot for expanded memory options is also rumored for the upcoming device. #Nexus7 や #Nexus9 などの #アンドロイド #タブレットや#iPad 、#iPadmini なども買取いたします！ 使わなくなったタブレットも当店へお売りください！ 査定は無料です！ pic.twitter.com/Ylj08pfil4 — シータ松山店 (@thetamatuyama) March 25, 2017 Considering that the Nexus 7 2017 is a tablet, its display is something that Google would most likely focus on. Previous iterations of the Nexus 7 have been equipped with premium displays, and expectations are high that the 2017 version of the powerhouse tablet would also feature a formidable screen. Rumors about the Nexus 7 2017’s display are abounding, with some stating that the upcoming tablet would feature a Full HD AMOLED 1920×1080 panel and others stating that Google might go the distance and equip the device with a QHD AMOLED 2560×1440 display. The release date of the Nexus 7 2017 remains unknown at this point, though speculations are high that the tablet might be released sometime during the second half of the year. Considering that the Google Pixel 2 and the Google Pixel 2 XL would most likely be released around October this year, there is a good chance that the Nexus 7 2017 might also make its highly-anticipated debut around the same time. Pricing for the Nexus 7 remains unknown, though considering the device’s history, there is a pretty fair chance that the 2017 edition of the popular tablet would be offered at around the $250-$300 range. Otherwise, the tech giant might opt to market the Nexus 7 2017 as a more premium device, in which case the tablet might be offered at a higher price point, possibly around $400-$450. Do take note, however, that these are but rumors. Thus, take this information with a grain of salt.

"I thought that YouTube was like TV. But it isn't," he said at Google's annual advertising show. "YouTube talks back. It's interactive. And YouTube is everywhere." Kyncl's message resonated with advertisers. Gross ad revenue at YouTube soared from roughly $4 billion in 2013 to $11 billion last year, brokerage firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. estimates. At the same event in 2016, Chief Executive Officer Susan Wojcicki boasted about taking ad dollars from traditional TV networks. Yet now the same traits Kyncl said made YouTube better than TV have plunged the video service into crisis. Some of the world's largest advertisers, from Verizon Communications Inc. to Johnson & Johnson, stopped spending on YouTube because of concern their ads could appear next to offensive videos. More big companies pulled back on Friday, including PepsiCo, Starbucks and Wal-Mart Stores. This week, $26 billion was knocked off parent company Alphabet's market value. "I've always been suspect of advertising on YouTube. There's not really great content in there," said Rob Griffin, chief innovation officer at marketing agency Almighty. "This will dent their long-term prospect of making YouTube an alternative to TV." While the shift to online video viewing favors YouTube, it is scrambling to reassure companies and ad agencies they've made the right decision to spend money on the site, and convince them YouTube will protect their ads from offensive material in the future. Google attempted to curb the controversy Monday, pledging publicly to roll out new controls for marketers. In a memo sent to partners later in the week, Google described more detailed changes, including a new video verification process, long sought by advertisers, and a staff hotline dedicated to brand safety. Another feature Google promised will use machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to flag suspect videos. The new approach would now yank ads if offensive language appeared on a T-shirt in a video, for instance, something that didn't happen before, according to the memo. Google aims to implement most of the changes by Sunday, according to the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday. Even if the company meets that deadline, it may struggle to solve the issue. While TV companies have almost total control over what appears on a given channel, creating a safe space for brands, YouTube opens itself up to anyone who wants to post a video. Advertisers often buy ads across the whole site, or large groups of popular videos, instead of buying ads for a specific channel. The company has safeguards to block offensive content, but the volume of video being uploaded is too great to identify every infringing video. YouTube warned as much in its memo. Forthcoming changes "should give [advertisers] confidence that their ads will not appear against inappropriate content," the memo read, "albeit with the volume of content involved this can never be 100% guaranteed." The company noted that four of the forty-eight videos highlighted by news outlets over the past month would, even under the new policies, not automatically disable ads. YouTube decided the four remaining videos, which had religious and political content, did not violate its policies. But it said new tools will help advertisers choose whether their ads run alongside such content. "What they have done clearly is not enough," said Paul Verna, an analyst with EMarketer. "They must sit down with advertisers and literally show them how they are changing these algorithms." The duration and magnitude of the uproar surprised most media partners and some agency executives given that YouTube has never been able to guarantee against ads appearing next to inflammatory videos. Yet brands are acutely sensitive at a moment of political upheaval in the U.S., and Europe. They're opportunistic too. Advertisers are now urging Google to let outside companies track issues like safe content, measurement and fraudulent ads on YouTube, according to David Cohen, North American president for Magna Global. Google mostly handles this in-house currently. With traditional TV, Nielsen Holdings Plc surveys households' TV viewing habits and extrapolates this to tell advertisers and TV networks how many people watched shows. In its memo to advertisers this week, Google said it will offer detailed reporting at the level of specific videos and YouTube channels. That includes "Google Preferred," a premium service that lets advertisers pair their ads with top-performing videos. One industry executive said this is an important change giving more advertisers more insight into where their ads run. The person didn't want to be identified talking about a private memo. Google also said in the memo that YouTube customers will able to hire "vendors to verify the safety" of ad placements. Advertisers think they have more leverage now because they are negotiating new deals with Google ahead of an annual ad industry sales process known as Upfronts, which usually happen in late May. One of the biggest concerns among YouTube executives right now is how the video site will be perceived and treated at this year's event, according to a person familiar with their thinking. Advertisers have long bemoaned the lack of information they get from YouTube and are seizing an opportunity to extract a bit more, said James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. "It's a power struggle. If you see an opening against Google, you take it," he added. However, it's a struggle that YouTube may ultimately win, because the power in digital advertising ultimately rests with who controls the most viewers. And people are watching more online and less on traditional TV. "The stakes have never been higher in the competition between legacy TV players and digital," Magna's Cohen said. "But linear television is an eroding asset."

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Mar 26, 2017 - Page 16　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp More firms join boycott of YouTube ads LIMITED IMPACT:Moody’s forecast that the backlash would not last long, as Google is ‘laser-focused’ on the issue, while an analyst said revenue would only take a 2% hit AP, SAN FRANCISCO An advertising boycott of YouTube LLC is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Starbucks Corp on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen AG and other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads do not appear alongside unsavory videos. It is not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos, because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted on Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they will not return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo Inc and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than 2 million other third-party Web sites. If Google cannot lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of US dollars in revenue. However, most analysts doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue last year totaled US$73.5 billion after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for US$5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted that the backlash would not last long, because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by British newspaper the Times revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. Alphabet shares on Friday fell US$4.51 to close at US$835.14. This story has been viewed 2710 times. Comments will be moderated.

A screen grab of a smart phone shows the use of a new search feature called ‘shortcuts’ from Google. The feature will appear as a row of icons that show up below the Google search box that users can just tap in order to see the latest weather in the area, movie times, restaurant recommendations, or sports teams’ scores. The feature will be released this week. GOOGLE Enlarge Its new feature, called “shortcuts,” will appear as a row of icons below the Google search box. Instead of having to ponder and then speak or type a request, the shortcuts will let you tap the icons to get the latest weather, movie showtimes, sports scores, restaurant recommendations, and other common requests. The shortcuts will begin appearing this week in updates to Google’s app for iPhones, Android phones, and its mobile website. The Android app will include such tools as a currency converter, a language translator, and an ATM locator, which you can also summon with a tap. Those tools may eventually make it to the iPhone as well, although Google says it doesn’t know when. The changes are the latest step in Google’s quest to turn its search engine into a secondary brain that anticipates people’s needs and desires. The search engine gleans these insights by analyzing your past requests and, when you allow it, tracking your location, a practice that periodically raises privacy concerns about Google’s power to create digital profiles of its users. Based on the knowledge that Google already has accumulated, its shortcuts feature may already list your favorite sports teams or recommend nearby restaurants serving cuisines you prefer. Shortcuts also show how Google’s search engine has been adapting to its audience, now that smart phones have become the primary way millions of people stay connected to the Internet. Since more than half of requests for Google’s search engine now come from smart phones, the Mountain View, Calif., company has adapted its services to smaller screens, touch keyboards, and apps instead of websites. Early in that process, Google tweaked its search engine to answer many requests with factual summaries at the top of its results page, a change from simply displaying a list of links to other websites. Voice-recognition technology also allows you to speak your request into a phone instead of typing it. The transition is going well so far. Google’s revenue rose 20 percent last year to $89 billion, propelled by digital ads served up on its search engine, YouTube, and Gmail.

ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The location-monitoring feature began to roll out on Wednesday in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is installed on most of the world’s smart phones. It also will be available on personal computers. Google believes the tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without texting or calling them. The Mountain View, Calif., company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long — from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location-sharing in one of the world’s most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. Other apps have similar tracking features; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. That’s one of the reasons Google isn’t expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially because everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. “We don’t feel like we are changing the game,” said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google’s vice president of maps. Maps users can activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn’t have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest PeopleImages One of the best parts about using Gmail is Gchat, the instant-messaging function that lets you chat with other Google users and still look like you're the most productive person in the room. The handy feature makes it easier to get projects done, helps to keep your inbox free of clutter, and lets you chat with your work wife without the whole office overhearing. But all good things must come to an end, and yesterday, Google announced that as of June 26, that they're doing away with Gchat as we know it. But don't panic yet: The good news is that they understand our love for/need for a handy chat function and have a replacement already available they're directing users toward. You might have used Google Hangouts for a Skype-like chat, but the platform also has an instant-messaging function (and is arguably a little prettier to use than Gchat). It actually launched back in 2013 as another option for IM-ing within Gmail, but it never caught on quite like Gchat, which has been around since 2005. Luckily, not a ton about the actual instant-messaging experience will change (although the name might create some initial confusion when you ask a coworker to "Hangout" with you). The interface of Hangouts is arguably prettier, too—and Android users might like how well Hangouts integrates with their phones and tablets. With a ton of different instant-messaging options available for the adults who grew up on AIM, it makes sense that Google's continuing to evolve what they offer. After all, if things stayed totally the same...well, we shudder to think of the screen names we'd have to use (xxskatingprincess86xx, anyone?).

We also got to grips with Virgin’s new 4K V6 set-top box to see if it’s a true challenger to Sky Q. With internet TV streaming growing increasingly popular, these four new devices from big-name brands should be sure to pique the interest of those looking to change the way they watch TV at home. You can see which models we ran the rule over below. Best Buy internet TV boxes – whether you want catch-up, live TV or a subscription service, there’s bound to be a Best Buy that’s right for you New internet TV boxes tested for 2017 Google Chromecast Ultra £69 TV streamers may be a foreign concept to some, but even the unfamiliar may well have heard of Chromecast. Tens of millions of Google’s little streamers have been sold worldwide since launching in 2013, and now we finally have a follow-up. The big difference with the Chromecast Ultra is that it can stream 4K content. That means, provided you have a 4K TV as well, you can watch video from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube in a resolution four times greater than regular Full-HD. Read our full review to see whether it’s able to trump its predecessor. Humax H3 Espresso £80 Humax is very popular with our members when it comes to PVRs. But internet TV boxes are uncharted territory for the brand, so we were keen to get the H3 Espresso to the lab. The H3 Espresso’s most interesting feature is that it works together with the Humax FVP-4000T PVR to give you features like multi-room viewing and the ability to record streamed shows. As useful as that may be to a select few, our testing focused on its capability as a standalone streamer. Can it compete with the best, or does its lack of apps hold it back? Read the full H3 Espresso review to find out. Nvidia Shield Pro £279 Nvidia is a huge name in the world of PC gaming but relatively unknown outside of it. Even if you don’t care about games, though, the Shield Pro could be a streamer to keep an eye on. It has a huge number of features, a sizeable 500GB hard drive for saving media and comes with two controllers – both a voice-control remote and an Xbox-style gamepad. The price is steep, though. Is 4K video, game streaming, casting and Google Smart Home control enough to tempt you? Find out how it scored in our full review. Nvidia Shield £189 The Shield Pro’s little brother, the Nvidia Shield is the successor to Nvidia’s 2015 debut model. It can do most of what the Pro offers, albeit with different confines – most notably a considerably smaller hard drive. It does still have 4K capability though. You also still get the voice-control remote and the gamepad included in the price, and streaming app support doesn’t change. How does it stack up to the Pro, or any other internet TV box for that matter? We reveal all in our review. Virgin Media’s first ever 4K set-top box Virgin Media V6 box A number of months after rival Sky revealed its Sky Q 2TB 4K box, Virgin Media has finally returned with a challenger: the V6 box. On paper, it certainly seems to tick all of right the boxes. You can record six channels at a time (or five while channel-hopping), it has a large 1TB hard drive for all of your recordings, and there are some neat extra features such as automatically recorded recommendations and a series link that factors in on-demand content. If you were concerned about being able to watch Sky content on a Virgin Media box, then rest assured that you can get Sky Sports and Sky Cinema content on the V6. There’s also a Netflix app, although there’s still no Amazon Prime Video. The V6 box is only available to Virgin TV subscribers, so it’s not just something you can just pick up off the high street. A 4K TV subscription contract is an expensive commitment, and you want to be sure you’re making the right choice. Find out how the Virgin Media V6 box compares with Sky Q in our full review.

If you’re considering the iCandy Peach, you’re not alone. Figures from Google Trends reveal it’s the most searched-for pushchair for spring 2017. It’s no surprise parents are scanning Google for the iCandy Peach. It’s actually been around for a while but, like Doctor Who, it’s had many regenerations, which could prove slightly confusing if you’re a parent-to-be looking for your first pushchair. This latest version is the fourth iCandy Peach (pictured above, right) – first there was the Peach, then the Peach 2 and Peach 3, and now it’s back to plain old Peach again. This latest version is a travel-system pushchair with a reversible main seat. It’s got some celebrity cachet, with reported fans including Victoria Beckham and The Rock. But it’s at the higher end of the pushchair price spectrum, at £775, and can’t be used from birth unless you buy the extra carrycot for £190. This might be chump change for the Beckhams but, for the rest of us, it’s worth making sure this is a good investment. Is the iCandy Peach worth it?

(Richard Vogel/Associated Press) Related Stories Google apologizes to advertisers for posts alongside offensive YouTube content Tegan and Sara, Tyler Oakley blast YouTube 'restricted mode' blocking of LGBT content An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Walmart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavoury videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Major advertisers suspend campaigns on Google's YouTube ​Google apologizes to advertisers for posts alongside offensive YouTube content Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video are now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Promise to placate advertisers Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Walmart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Walmart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. No major impact expected If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totalled $73.5 billion US last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion US, or nearly eight per cent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about two per cent this year. Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is "laser-focused" on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly four per cent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 US to close at $835.14 US on Friday. ​ © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

The company hasn’t changed anything about its policies or its practices, but Google wanted to remind its users in a blog post how the warnings work. Some context: Since the presidential election, journalists have reported receiving messages from Google notifying them that “government-backed hackers may be trying to steal your password.” The Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe and Vox’s Ezra Klein, both political journalists, reported receiving the message in November. Another batch of folks, many of them journalists, raised concerns on Twitter this week. The timing coincides with an investigation into possible links between the campaign of President Donald Trump and the Russian government.

The House is expected to pass a similar measure, which will then go to President Trump’s desk. Internet privacy is a great idea. Creating a tilted field, though, where one industry has a government-enforced advantage is a poor idea. The ISP privacy rule, promulgated by the FCC when Tom Wheeler was chair, was always a bad idea. If nothing else, it provided companies that profit on big data, such as Google, an edge in the online marketplace. More than that, it did not even protect consumer data, as it assumes technology from the 1990s is still pervasive. ADVERTISEMENT A couple of former Federal Trade Commission senior officials warned, while the FCC was still considering the rules, that “the proposed rules would do very little to promote the cause of ‘privacy’ in the first place. If they are adopted, all other participants in the Internet ecosystem will remain exempt, will continue collecting all of the same information that the ISPs would have collected, and may continue selling the same information as before to the same data brokers. The Big Data marketplace will carry on—except, ironically, the FCC will have insulated its largest players from ISP competition.”   In the 1990s, consumers usually accessed the Internet from desktop computers and over wireline services from their homes. The ISPs provided Domain Name System (DNS) lookup services, and most Internet traffic was unencrypted. DNS lookup services are necessary, incidentally, to translate domain names as consumers know them to the numerical addresses computers understand. For example, a consumer may type “www.google.com” to access Google’s website. Google’s physical Internet address is 172.217.7.174. Technology and practices have changed significantly. Today, people access the Internet in a number of different ways, using a number of different devices. Sure, consumers still access the Internet from their homes. But the Internet and devices are much more portable. Consumers access the Internet at coffee shops, restaurants, airports, and many other locations. Consumers use desktop computers, laptops, cell phones, tablets, and other electronic devices. Personal computers represent, perhaps, 53 percent of Internet traffic today, with that percentage likely to drop substantially in the next few years. Internet providers have largely ceded DNS lookup services to independent companies, such as DYN, or consumers can instruct their computers to use a specific, non-ISP related, lookup service. Compared to the 1990s, many more websites encrypt their traffic. According to Google, the percentage of requests to its servers using encrypted connections has grown from about 50 percent in 2014 to 75 percent as of January, 2017. In the United States, Google states that just under 75 percent of the requests it receives are encrypted. Divorcing DNS services from Internet delivery services and the exponential increase in encrypted traffic means ISPs see significantly less browsing data than they did a decade ago. When ISPs controlled the DNS lookup system, they knew exactly what websites consumers visited and could see what information consumers requested. Encrypted traffic means ISPs see significantly less meaningful data— often just a limited version of a website’s address— than to which they previously had access. Increasing the number of devices and Internet access points also narrows the universe of data available to ISPs. Assuming, only for the sake of argument, ISPs can see entire browsing habits, a single ISP may not see consumers’ habits when they browse the Internet on cell phones or at coffee shops. Now, to compare the data an ISP may see to the personal data a service such a Google can see. Assume a consumer has a Gmail account, uses Google Drive, Google Maps, GooglePay, has a Google+ account, browses the Internet with Chrome while logged into her Google account, and uses an Android phone, which is linked to her Google account. In this case, Google knows the consumer’s name, has access to her emails, can access her documents, her Maps history, has her payment information, has access to her browsing history, and so much more. Google, therefore, has much greater access to information about the consumer than an ISP could ever dream of having. Technological advances along with changes in how consumers access the Internet, have addressed a number of former Chairman Wheeler’s consumer privacy concerns. While ISPs certainly have access to a sliver of consumer data, services such as Google have greater access to personal information. The ISP privacy rule regulated the former, while saying nothing about non-ISP related services. Rather than protecting consumer privacy, the rule improperly tilted the Internet ecosystem toward services such as Google. Jonathon Paul Hauenschild, J.D. is a technology policy analyst.

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi is one of the most followed leaders in the world today. However, his vast social media outreach has not cost the exchequer a single rupee since he assumed the Prime Minister's office in May 2014. This was revealed in a reply by the Prime Minister's Office to an RTI application filed by Delhi Deputy Chief Minister, Manish Sisodia. The reply clearly states that no social media campaign has been run on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or Google accounts maintained by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). The reply also stated that the official mobile app of the Prime Minister's Office, 'PMO India', was designed by students in a contest conducted by MyGov and Google. "There was no cost except the prize money in developing the app. Even this prize money has been paid by Google," the reply stated. The response to Sisodia's RTI application shows that the 'Narendra Modi App' is neither developed nor maintained by PMO or Government of India. It does, however, add, that "citizens are using it to connect and interact with the Prime Minister," in addition to the websites www.pmindia.gov.in and www.mygov.in. This implies that the Narendra Modi App too, has not cost anything to the taxpayer. A look at the developer page of the Narendra Modi App, shows that the BJP's IT Cell has developed, and is maintaining it. Recently, a senior All India Radio official had revealed that PM Modi was unhappy to see advertisements being released for the initial few episodes of his monthly radio address 'Mann Ki Baat'. Mann Ki Baat has now become a programme where All India Radio spends almost nothing, and earns a lot, the official added. In 2015-16, the programme generated a gross advertising revenue of Rs 4.78 crore, he told the Economic Times.

Thanks to Google, we can find out what those preconceptions are. The infographic below, created by Exeter International, used Google auto suggest to find what people most commonly search for in conjuction with countries, showing us what each country is most famous for (or, at least, what people associate them with). Interestingly, food and drink, sports and holidays are the most common themes. However, apparently the US is known for its higher education, as "universities" was the top search term associated with the US, making it the only country within the education category. While Russia and vodka seems like an obvious one, who knew that Latvia is known for its jokes? Or that Guyana seems to be home to a world famous sponge cake?

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement What’s new in Android O? 03/21/2017 at 1:52 PM by Brad Linder 3 Comments Google has released the first developer preview for Android O, the next major version of Google’s operating system for smartphones, tablets, and other devices. Among other things, the update brings new notification behavior, support for picture-in-picture on smartphones, and power management improvements. The Android O developer preview is very much pre-release software, and Google doesn’t really encourage anyone but developers to try it out yet. But if you’ve got a Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, or Nexus Player, you can find factory images at Google’s developer site. Google plans to release the final version of Android O in the third quarter of 2017. Here are some of the things that are new in Android O. Notification channels Developers can set different channels for each type of notification, allowing users to adjust settings based on the type of notification. For example, if you have a news app, you could create separate notification channels for world news, us news, tech news, and business news. Then users could opt to only see alerts for the channels they’re interested in… or to only allow some types of alerts to cause their phone to vibrate or make a sound. Picture in Picture mode Google introduced multi-window support with Android N. The next version of Android introduces a new way to view two apps at once. In addition to displaying two apps in side-by-side windows, you can view one in a smaller window running on top of a full screen app. This lets you do things like watch a video in a small window while surfing the web in a larger screen. Picture in Picture (PIP) mode was already available for Android TV, but with Android O it’s coming to smartphones as well. Autofill Framework There’s a new API that will help users autofill forms for login information credit cards, or other text areas, much the way you can in many web browsers. Adaptive Icons There’s support for a new type of home screen/launcher icon that changes shape depending on the device you’re using. For example, an OEM that has a launcher featuring square icons can show square icons for your app, while phones with circular icons on the home screen will automatically choose your app’s circular icon. Adaptive icons show up in home screen icons, shortcuts, settings, and share dialogs. Background process limits Google is imposing new restrictions on what apps can do in the background in an effort to reduce the impact of background processes from third-party apps on battery life. This comes through new Background Execution Limits and Background Location Limits. Enhanced support for multiple displays Apps that support multi-window mode can now be moved between multiple displays on any device that has more than one display. For example, if you’re using a Chromebook with Android app support and HDMI output, you should be able to view one app on a monitor and another on your Chromebook screen. Note that only one app can be in a “resumed state” at a time, which means you can look at two apps at a time this way, but only the one that has focus will be fully active, while the other will be paused (but not stopped). And much more Here are just a few of the other changes in Android O: Overhauled Settings menus New options for tweaking the Android Nav Bar user interface using the System UI Tuner The System UI Tuner also lets you select up to two lock screen shortcuts to quickly launch messenger, or a browser instead of the camera, for example Developers can now create apps that display wide-gamut color images on devices with wide-gamut color displays Better support for high-quality Bluetooth audio thanks to aptX, aptX HD, and LDAC codec support New developer options also let you adjust sample rate and other settings for Bluetooth audio codecs Wi-Fi Aware feature allows some devices to discover and connect to one another without using internet access Improved keyboard navigation for Chromebooks with Android app support and other devices with keyboard (including consistent arrow and tab behavior) AAudio API for high-performance, low-latency audio Multiprocess mode for WebView is enabled by default Fonts in XML feature that lets developers use fonts as resources without bundling them as assets Support for in-app pinning of shortcuts and widgets Developers can declare the “category” their apps fit into, allowing similar apps to be grouped together for presentation of things like data usage, storage usage, or battery usage Support for notification badges on the home screen Installation of apps from unknown sources has to be approved on an app-by-app basis instead of via a universal setting There are also clues that a native theme manager may be coming to Android. This is just the start. Google says a second developer preview is on track to launch in May, followed by a 3rd version with the final developer APIs in June. One last developer preview is scheduled for a July release, before Android ) is officially released to OEMs and the Android Open Source project in the third quarter of 2017.

I recall playing one game on my previous phone, a Samsung S4, that kept asking for the location data continuously and drained my battery so fast that it would reach 15% by the time I woke up after a full charge before I slept. I even thought it was an issue with the battery and bought a new one only to see the same issue happen with the new battery. I only realized that it was that specific game after I got too bored and uninstalled it.

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed they have suspended their advertising on YouTube after The Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections continued even after Google apologised for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavoury videos. The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values Wal-Mart It is not an easy problem to fix. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is currently posted on YouTube every minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophist­icated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. On Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signalling the company’s confidence it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable ­videos from ever being posted on YouTube – an effort that could prompt charges of censorship. Some outraged advertisers have made it clear they will not ­return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than 2 million other third-party websites. If Google cannot lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s parent, Alphabet.

On Thursday, the streaming music service mostly known as a place to hear podcasts and remixes from unknown DJs confirmed that it had taken $70 million in debt funding -basically a loan from various investors-in order to stay in business. It's never a good sign when venture-backed companies have to raise money from debt financing groups, because it indicates that traditional investors don't have much hope for the company. This appears to be the case for SoundCloud, as TechCrunch reports that the debt funding was raised because the company couldn't close a $100 million round of funding. Back in February, when SoundCloud released its 2015 financial information , we found out that the company had lost $55 million for the year and was at the risk of running out of cash. Yet, while having an extra $70 million is certainly helpful, it's probably not going to be enough to save SoundCloud from the fate of Rdio, Grooveshark, MOG, and other failed music streaming services. In fact, looking at the landscape, streaming services in general are kind of fucked. The payment model for streaming music services makes it very difficult for companies to actually make money. In addition to infrastructure costs, payroll, and marketing, music licensing fees paid to the labels mean that the profit margin for subscription streaming is often negative. Profitability, even for the biggest players, is still largely a pipe dream. As a result, it's a game where only services with a lot of funding and a lot of users (Spotify), or a lot of backing by a parent company and a lot of users (Apple Music), are relatively safe. At least for now. But who is the most fucked? Who is just sort of fucked? Who has the best shot at surviving? Here is a ranking of streaming music companies, ranked from most to least fucked. Most screwed 1. PonoMusic PonoMusic technically isn't a streaming service, but we included it on the list because it's just so very fucked. You may recall that Neil Young's terrible Pono Player had an accompanying online store from which Pono owners could buy high resolution music. Hilariously, that store didn't even get Young's May 2016 single (it was a Tidal exclusive), which was a very bad sign for the future of both the service and player. In July, the company announced that the PonoMusic store would be going " offline " as it switched to a new source for its content. But more than eight months later, the store is still offline . In fact, Pono hasn't tweeted since January, and the music player doesn't appear to be for sale on its website. If PonoMusic ever makes an actual comeback, we will be shocked. 2. SoundCloud Poor SoundCloud. The service has raised an enormous amount of money-$320 million since 2009, according to Crunchbase -and the product is good . It's also known as a launching ground for indie artists before they make it big (Chance the Rapper, Lorde are famous alums), and it's been platform to which aspiring DJs could upload their tracks. But the reality is that SoundCloud can't compete against its bigger, better-funded rivals. The fact that it couldn't close a funding round and had to raise debt instead speaks volumes. Moreover, SoundCloud Go, its premium product, hasn't exactly pulled in paying users-in fact, the company had to launch a dumbed-down, cheaper version last month. Here's a bet: Within 12 months, Spotify or Google is going to buy SoundCloud. 3. Tidal Tidal has basically been a disaster since Jay-Z relaunched it back in 2015. In just two years , the company has gone through multiple CEOs , faced lawsuits from customers and employees, and was reportedly late with payments to some of its indie labels. Even Jay-Z feels like he was ripped off ! Tidal might last a bit longer, but eventually, Jay-Z will probably get tired of investing money in a service no one cares about and give up the ghost. 4. Napster/Rhapsody You didn't misread that. Napster-or at least its brand name-is still around. Of course, the only thing that remains of the original peer-to-peer music app is the logo- everything else is actually just Rhapsody, one of the very first streaming music services. (The two merged back in 2011.) In many ways, the Spotifys and Apple Musics of the world owe a huge debt to Rhapsody/Napster. Rhapsody was the first subscription service that licensed streaming music from all of the major label groups. But being early isn't always a good thing, and the company has struggled over the years. As of 2015, it had just 3.5 million paying subscribers. We're more and more amazed that Napster/Rhapsody is still alive with every year that passes. 5. Pandora Pandora is in a heap of trouble-take note of its depressing financial results and recent layoffs-but unlike most of the other stand-alone music services, it's also a public company. More importantly, Pandora has users. Pandora's free product has about 81 million monthly active users, which makes it one of the most popular services around. The problem, however, is that those users aren't making the company any money. It's pinning a lot of its hopes to its new Pandora Premium service, but early reviews say that it has nothing to offer over Spotify or Apple Music. If its stock plummets far enough, Pandora could be a great takeover target. Medium screwed 6. Deezer Deezer isn't very popular in the US, but the service has more than 6 million users across the globe. The company planned a French IPO back in 2015, but ended up canceling it , citing "market conditions"-that's code for "Pandora is tanking and we're afraid our share price will be bad"-but still managed to raise another $109 million in January 2016. It's hard to say what the future of Deezer is, but the company hasn't made any layoffs, so that's an OK sign. 7. Groove Music Microsoft's music service isn't exactly a focal point for the company. (In fact, we forgot it existed until we started writing this story.) And that's why it's medium-level screwed. On the one hand, Groove Music has Microsoft's very pliant coffers to keep it up and running. On the other hand, if Microsoft decides it's bored of doing its own streaming service (as Sony did back in 2015), it could wind up nuking the service. 8. iTunes Music Store Technically, iTunes isn't a streaming service, but its importance in the digital music space earns it a place on this list. For nearly a decade , iTunes was the most popular place to buy digital music. But times are changing. In January, Nielsen reported that in 2016, music streaming overtook digital music downloads for the first time. That means that iTunes's revenues are declining, and that's bad for the traditional iTunes Music Store. The good news is that Apple has an alternative for iTunes waiting in the wings: Apple Music. Last May, music industry analyst Mark Mulligan predicted that Apple Music revenue would overtake iTunes Music Store revenue by 2020, at which point Apple might consider turning off the old download store. Within a few years, the iTunes Music store will probably be fucked, but for now, it's still the most popular way to buy music. Least screwed 9. Google Play Music Google Play Music isn't as popular as the other major streaming players, but the fact that it's backed by Google gives it a good shot at survival. Google Play Music is actually a few things: It's part iTunes (you can buy songs); part iTunes Match (you can upload songs you downloaded elsewhere for access anywhere); and part Apple Music. As a bonus, anyone who subscribes to Google Play Music also gets a YouTube Red subscription, and vice versa. For $10 a month, that's a lot of streaming music and ad-free YouTube content. 10. iHeartRadio iHeartRadio is run by iHeartMedia (the company formerly known as Clear Channel Communications), and thus has a huge tie-in with most of the nation's largest radio stations. iHeartRadio might not have cachet of Spotify, but with 100 million registered users in the US, it has a lot of ears. Moreover, because its owner is the biggest player in the terrestrial radio business, it doesn't have the same financial issues as Slacker or Pandora. iHeartRadio might not be cool, but it's also not screwed. 11. Amazon Music Unlimited Amazon has had a music service for its Prime users for a few years, but in October, it launched its direct Spotify/Apple Music rival, Amazon Music Unlimited . Though it is very likely that Amazon sees its music offering as a loss-leader-Prime members pay $8 a month instead of $10 for non-Prime members-as long as Amazon doesn't get bored by music, it's probably pretty safe. 12. Spotify Make no mistake: Spotify has some very real business problems. For one, it can't make money , though some investors insist it might find profitability this year. For another, musicians and labels don't all love the service. And the longer it delays its IPO , the more money it owes some of its investors. None of that is great. But the reality is that Spotify is far and away the biggest streaming service globally-both paid and free-on the planet, with more than 50 million paying users. Moreover, even though labels and artists often decry how much Spotify pays them, only the biggest artists can actually afford to not be on the service. Post-IPO, Spotify could be screwed, but for now, it's the definition of too big to fail. 13. Apple Music Let's be honest: Apple Music will probably never outpace Spotify in number of subscribers. Spotify had at least a four-year head start, and it has a free product that can get people hooked. But that doesn't matter. In less than two years, Apple Music has managed to attract more than 20 million paying subscribers, something no company on this list (save Spotify) can even fathom reaching. Plus, Apple Music is backed by the richest corporation in the world. And as stated above, in the future, Apple Music will likely be the iTunes Music Store's replacement. As revenue for the iTunes Music Store declines, Apple is going to do everything in its power to make Apple Music make up the difference. Ones we've already lost Rdio: Rdio was acquired by Pandora in 2015 and was the basis for the new Pandora Premium. A lot of us really loved Rdio, but in the end, its death was entirely predictable . Grooveshark: Who knew a business model built entirely on intellectual property theft wouldn't work? (Not even OG Napster was as brazen as Grooveshark.) The service, which was awesome for music fans-if not great for musicians-was wonderful, but it was sued out of existence back in 2015. Beats Music: Beats Music launched in January 2014, and as music services go, it was pretty rad. Then Apple bought Beats in May of 2014 for $3 billion. It ended up using the underpinnings of Beats Music for Apple Music, which was launched in 2015. MOG: Beats Music might be Apple Music's precursor, but Beats Musics' precursor was MOG. For a brief moment, it looked like MOG could make a name for itself (it was available in the US before Spotify and offered a similar service), but it couldn't compete and was sold to Beats for just $12 million in 2012. Songza: Songza was never that popular, but its curated playlists made it a favorite for many music lovers. Google acquired the service in 2014 and shut it down at the beginning of 2016. Fortunately, most of Songza's best features are now integrated into Google Play Music. Last.fm (for streaming): Last.fm used to be a great way to stream music, but its owner, CBS, shut down that feature in 2014. The scrobbling service-the Last.fm term for making a record of every song a person listens to-still exists. Milk Music: Samsung tried to enter the streaming music space in 2014 with the bizarrely named Milk Music. But the service curdled and ultimately shut down in September 2016. GhostTunes: Country superstar Garth Brooks famously hates digital music, including iTunes. Still, even Brooks had to recognize that even the most ardent Chris Gaines fans are annoyed by CDs. In 2014, Brooks launched GhostTunes , his own shitty version of iTunes. Amazingly, the service managed to exist until Amazon bought it (and the digital rights to Brooks' catalog) in October 2016 . Sony Music Unlimited: Sony used to have its own subscription streaming service. Sony Music Unlimited launched in the US in early 2011, just a few months before Spotify's stateside debut, but never managed to gain a lot of users. Sony conceded defeat in early 2015, ditching its own program for a Spotify-backed service .

Rending Gchat away from its roster of services signals Google’s push to focus on Hangouts moving forward.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google is finally ringing the death knell for Google Talk — more famously known as Gchat — and is replacing it permanently with Hangouts. The company released the latter back in 2013 as a beefier iteration of Gmail's sidebar chat platform, although users were free to use Gchat just as well if so they chose. Google Pulls Gchat's Life Support Users won't be able to access Gchat come June 26, at which point they'll be forcibly shifted to Hangouts. Google will notify users with a heads up in the coming weeks. After which they'll be automatically transported to Hangouts, like it or not. It doesn't seem, however, that the change is significant and experience-breaking. There will still be a messaging platform integrated into the core Gmail experience, and contacts will also be transitioned over. Google has been attempting to convince users to switch to Hangouts for years. This time, it's drastically doing so. Google Talk For Android Also Pulled By extension, the Google Talk app for Android will also be defunct, alongside other apps that are designed to work with Google Talk services. To reiterate, this is not looking to be a sudden, brutal change of platforms. Hangouts, and all apps which support Hangouts, will still be functional. That said, seeing Gchat being punted into the sunset might trigger the waterworks for some people, seeing as how Gchat was the primary messaging tool of yesteryear, becoming huge in the early aughts. It also brings back fond memories of the early days of the internet, at an epoch where AIM headlined internet usage. Google's Many Messaging Services But people aren't stuck with Hangouts. In fact, Google has a number of other messaging platforms. Why it's hosting such duplicates of relatively the same thing is a story for another time, but if you fancy anything other than Hangouts, there's also Allo, Duo, Android Messages, and even Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger — an experimental messaging app without a keyboard. While Google's strategy with its many messaging apps is unclear, it is updating both Allo and Duo with much-needed features: Allo with file-sharing, and Duo with voice-only calling functions. Google Is Also Removing SMS Messaging From Hangouts As The Verge reports, In addition to formally yanking Gchat, Google also announced that it's removing SMS from Hangouts starting May 22, and that Android users should instead switch to the new Android Messages app, which is getting brand-new features, such as reading receipts, group chats, and high-resolution photo sharing. The move proves Google is intent on pushing for Rich Communication Services, or RCS, an improved standard for text and multimedia sharing. Killing off Gchat might also be Google's way of signaling that it's about to reorient Hangouts into a worthy Slack competitor. Finally, in another effort of cleaning up its services, Google is also removing Google+ functionality on Gmail in the next month or so, Engadget reports. Also, a number of experimental Gmail Labs items are getting rolled into official Gmail add-ons. Saddened by the demise of Gchat? Have memories to share about the once-popular messaging platform?

The internet giant's core business of serving up advertising along with online search results appeared to be safe from the boycott, motivated by companies seeking assurances that their marketing messages won't be displayed along with hateful or outright terrorist content, particularly videos on Google-operated YouTube. The "backlash" could broaden into a rebellion against the market practice of software programming ad placements, slowing not only Google´s revenue but also that of other internet firms, according to Jackdaw chief analyst Jan Dawson. "I would think Google (and parent company Alphabet) would be extremely lucky to emerge from all this with minimal financial impact," he said in a blog post. "I think it's far more likely it sees both a short-term dent in its revenues and profits from the spreading boycotts and possibly a longer-term impact as brands reconsider their commitments to programmatic advertising in general." California-based Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw ads fearing placement alongside extremist content, said this week it is introducing new tools to give firms greater control. "We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn't align with their values," Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post. "We're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content." Hateful videos  The boycott began last week after the Times newspaper of London found BBC programs were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as Wagdi Ghoneim, an extremist preacher banned from Britain for inciting hatred. The analysis found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google had failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the European Union after it anonymously signaled their presence. The British government subsequently put its YouTube advertising on hold, saying in a statement, "it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content." Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, include the BBC, The Guardian newspaper group, McDonalds UK and the British arm of the major advertising agency Havas. The movement spread to the United States this week, with AT&T and Verizon pulling ads from Google. Google's parent Alphabet has lost slightly more than $20 billion in value since the start of this week based on a slip in its share price, in a sign the boycott has made investors nervous. Limits of software  Still, analysts believe the boycott's overall financial impact should be relatively small given the breadth of Google´s advertising activities. Even a "draconian" estimate of fiscal damage was limited to whittling perhaps a percent off Alphabet´s revenue, Morgan Stanley said in a note to investors. "It is a hit on their revenue, but it is an even bigger hit on their brand; on their reputation," Altimeter Group principal analyst Charlene Li said. "Google hasn´t taken it seriously enough." She recommended that Google engage advertisers directly and openly. A solution may not be easy. Google needs to strike a balance between pleasing advertisers and those who upload videos to YouTube and are free to take their creations elsewhere if unsatisfied with their shares of ad revenue. Google´s setbacks could benefit traditional television networks as ad dollars return there from YouTube or stall a shift to online, Morgan Stanley said. Google rivals such as Facebook could also benefit if they prove safer havens for digital advertising. Above all, the boycott highlights the limits of "programmatic" advertising, the practice of letting software algorithms decide pairing between marketing messages and content sought by online viewers. The technology is broadly used by internet firms, which heavily rely on software and artificial intelligence to figure out what ads will interest people at any given moment. Advertisers can chose "keywords" for targeting their ads, or sometimes use demographic options such as age groups or where people live. Google and the leading social network Facebook stopped publishing ads on websites posting sensational and fabricated stories following controversy about the role "fake news" may have played in the US presidential election last year. In February, YouTube ended an advertising partnership with its biggest star, PewDiePie, who had published videos containing anti-Semitic insults and Nazi references. The boycott will push for programmatic ad software to become more precise and better understand the content offered for pairing in order to reduce risks for advertisers, Li said. 0 0 Google ad boycott could aim ire at ad-serving software was posted in business of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on March 24, 2017 and was last updated on March 24, 2017.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Companies Google Hangouts will stop supporting SMS and Google Talk killed; where will your messages go now? Google recently announced Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat, hinting that the SMS service would leave Hangouts and Google Talk killed. Raymond Ronamai   March 25, 2017 18:45 IST Google splits messaging service to Hangouts Meet and Chat; here's what you need to knowGoogle Official Blog Those who followed this year's Google Cloud Next developer conference might be anticipating change coming to the company's messaging platforms Gmail and Google Hangouts as there were plans to make them more suitable for businesses. As expected, the search giant has now decided to stop SMS support in Google Hangouts. Google recently announced two new features called Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat, giving a clear hint that SMS service would go out of the window. Hangouts Meet is a video conferencing service that would let businesses have full screen video calls between employees around the world, wherein as many as 30 people could take part in a single video call. On the other hand, Hangouts Chat is a messaging app along the lines of Slack where teams can send messages and share documents. Also read: Google's new Android O is here for download Now, Google has announced that it would be removing carrier SMS functionality in Hangouts app for Android, starting on May 22. It said in a statement that you can expect an email notification with additional details in the coming days if your domain is affected by this change. So, where will your SMS that until now is accessible on Hangouts go? Well, Google is upgrading SMS with Android Messages that will provide a consistent and easy-to-use SMS experience for Android users, right out of the box. The company is focusing on making Android Messages the primary place to access SMS and also working with partners to upgrade SMS to RCS (Rich Communication Services). Meanwhile, Google Talk that was launched in 2005 to let Gmail users chat will be killed, now that there are much advanced platforms -- Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat.

(Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post) Print Email The Washington Post By The Washington Post The Oregonian on March 25, 2017 at 6:00 AM, updated March 25, 2017 at 6:02 AM comments "It's whack-a-mole. You can flag keywords. You can use algorithmic decision-making to minimize it, but there is no way to filter the word choice in real time." As the owner of a small business in liberal Massachusetts, John Ellis was a natural sympathizer of the nationwide call for advertisers to boycott Breitbart News, with its hard-edge conservative politics and close ties to President Donald Trump. But it made Ellis wonder about other, more extreme right-wing sites: Who is placing ads on them? A few clicks around the Internet revealed a troubling answer: He was. On a website owned by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer, Ellis saw an ad for his engineering company, Optics for Hire, pop up on the screen -- even though he had never knowingly bought the ad. What Ellis had stumbled on was a little-known facet of the booming world of Internet advertising. Businesses using the latest in online advertising technology offered by Google, Yahoo and major competitors are also increasingly finding their ads placed alongside politically extreme and derogatory content. That's because the ad networks offered by Google, Yahoo and others can display ads on vast numbers of third-party websites based on people's search and browsing histories. Although the strategy gives advertisers an unprecedented ability to reach customers who fit a narrow profile, it dramatically curtails their ability to control where their advertisements appear. "No one has any idea where their ads are going," Ellis said. In some cases, he added, ad networks "are monetizing hate." In a sign of growing frustration,  But the issue is broader. A Washington Post examination of dozens of sites with politically extreme and derogatory content found that many were customers of leading ad networks, which share a portion of revenue gleaned from advertisers with the site's operators. The Post's examination found that the networks had displayed ads for Allstate, IBM, DirectTV and dozens of other household brand names on websites with content containing racial and ethnic slurs, Holocaust denial and disparaging comments about African Americans, Jews, women and gay people. Some of these sites, the Post found, featured hateful and derogatory content throughout. In others, it was confined to comment sections, where users went far beyond the language used by the sites' writers, whose expressed views fell closer to the political mainstream. Google's AdSense, for example, last month ran ads for several firms alongside comments using a slur for African-Americans, saying "hang them all." Other Google-displayed ads, for Macy's and the genetics company 23andMe, appeared on the website My Posting Career, which describes itself as a "white privilege zone," next to a notice saying the site would offer a referral bonus for each member related to Adolf Hitler. "No business wants to be associated with sites like that," said Andy Kill, spokesman for genetic testing company 23andMe. "If you're trusting an ad algorithm to do this, this is what can happen," he said. "It's frustrating." My Posting Career did not reply to an email seeking comment. The problem has emerged as Web advertising strategies have evolved. Advertisers sometimes choose to place their ads on particular sites -- or avoid sites they dislike -- but a growing share of advertising budgets go to what the industry calls "programmatic" buys. These ads are aimed at people whose demographic or consumer profile is receptive to a marketing message, no matter where they browse on the Internet. Algorithms decide where to place ads, based on people's prior Web usage, across vastly different types of sites. The technology companies behind ad networks have slowly begun to address the issue but warn that it won't be easy to solve. They say their algorithms struggle to distinguish between content that is truly offensive and language that is not offensive in context. For example, it can be hard for computers to determine the difference between the use of a racial slur on a white-supremacy site and a website about history. The tech companies have also long been reluctant to put themselves in the position of an arbiter of speech -- given the subjectivity involved and the legal risk of making decisions about what content deserves to be read or not. It's a situation that tech giants are increasingly encountering in related spheres, too, with the proliferation of false and highly politicized news sites spreading misinformation on social networks. On Monday, following inquiries from The Post and requests from advertisers who also had been contacted by The Post, Google apologized to advertisers. It announced it would be conducting an "extensive review" of ad policies with the goal of taking a tougher stance on "hateful, offensive, and derogatory content." Google said such comments violate its hate-speech policies but would not say whether it had taken action against the sites. The company said it reviews thousands of sites each day for violations and booted more than 100,000 publishers -- including many single-author publishers -- from its AdSense network in 2016. Yahoo, which blocked one site that was the subject of a query by The Post, said it condemns racist or other hateful speech, adding, "Of the billions of ads served on a daily basis, there are rare instances when automated ad platforms serve ads in places they shouldn't." (The Washington Post sometimes uses such networks to place ads touting its offerings, such as subscriptions, and also generates revenue featuring ads sold through advertising networks.) Many of the companies contacted for this story -- including IBM, bareMinerals, Macy's, Everquote and Allstate -- expressed surprise and dismay that their ads appeared near derogatory content. Several said they had requested that networks blacklist those pages, which is easy to do for individual sites but not for entire categories of sites. Automated filters typically miss certain kinds of derogatory speech, and tech companies traditionally have not hired the massive number of people necessary to carefully monitor content on billions of Web pages. Some advertisers also expressed frustration that ad networks had failed to keep marketing messages from appearing alongside reader comments that might upset customers -- even on sites that themselves do not promote extremist content. Google's AdSense, for example, displayed an ad for cosmetics company bareMinerals in the comments section of Weaselzippers.us, an aggregator of conservative news. A user comment on the site used a derogatory word for gay men and said they should be "lying in a pool of blood." When The Post emailed an image of the Web page to bareMinerals spokeswoman Joanne Chiu Sulit, she said, "I was shocked that we were on that site." An email to Weaselzippers.us operators was not returned. * * * The issue of ad placements has become charged in an era of rising political polarization. The number of right-wing hate sites, as well as sites that traffic in sensationalist news and hoaxes, has doubled over the past year, according to ad auditing firm DoubleVerify. With so many new sites, it's difficult for advertisers to avoid having their ads appear in unwelcome places. "It's whack-a-mole," said Wayne Gattinella, chief executive of DoubleVerify. "You can flag keywords. You can use algorithmic decision-making to minimize it, but there is no way to filter the word choice in real time." Advertisers generally have little choice but to depend on ad networks. The major ones have policies prohibiting advertising on sites featuring discriminatory or hateful speech, but The Post found dozens of apparent violations. Many of the sites where The Post found violations are considered hate sites by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an advocacy group that tracks hate speech. "[Ad networks] have rules in place, but they don't enforce them," said Jillian York, an advocate with the Electronic Freedom Foundation, which runs Online Censorship, a program pushing technology companies to clarify why they remove content. Last month, an ad for insurance company Allstate appeared on Alternative-Right.BlogSpot.com, whose comments section praised "Hitler and his National Socialists as a visionary." Allstate said it has tried to avoid such sites through filters. "Allstate does not knowingly advertise on media that provokes hate or includes threatening, discriminatory or offensive language," spokeswoman Laura Strykowski said. Everquote and DirectTV ads appeared on Spencer's site, RadixJournal.com, alongside comments decrying the Catholic Church for advocating racial mixing and deluging white, Christian countries with "savages of the worst kind." DirectTV declined to comment. Everquote said that although it uses ad networks, "We specifically require that these advertising networks refrain from placing our ads on any sites containing and/or relating to, among other things, violence, sex, racism, sexism, pornography, illegal or potentially illegal subject matter, negative publicity or any other highly explosive subject matter." Ads for Macy's, Amazon.com, and even Planned Parenthood, appeared on the racially inflammatory website My Posting Career. Ads to shop on Amazon.com appeared on a site with an article headlined "Yes, I am a Nazi," and a comments sections peppered with profanity and racial slurs. Amazon, which also runs an ad network, declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.) * * * Silicon Valley companies long have resisted calls to more aggressively police content on their platforms, saying a free and open Internet is the underpinning of the Web itself. With the exception of child pornography, Congress largely has agreed with the Silicon Valley viewpoint, leaving tech companies substantial legal leeway to monitor - or not - the content that appears on the sites and platforms that they operate. But advertisers are demanding changes. "[Tech companies] are struggling to adjust to a reality where the same tools that enabled them to connect the world are now being used to drive it apart," entrepreneur and venture capitalist Noah Lichtenstein said. "This is the crisis of our time: How do you balance the desire to have the Web be open and connected with a rising tide of institutionalized hate and the protection of those who are being attacked?" It's not clear how effective the push to deprive such sites of advertising will be. Spencer said targeting Radix Journal and similar sites is unfair to advertisers because they have so little control over where their ads appear. And if the goal is to deprive extreme sites of money, he predicted the effort would have little effect because the revenue from Web ads is so small, totaling at most a few thousand dollars a year. "If I were kicked off of all of these things, it would have no effect on my life whatsoever," Spencer said. Emails to contact information listed for Alternative-Right.blogspot.com received no reply. Breitbart News also did not return emails seeking comment about the advertising boycott directed against the site. Disqus, a Silicon Valley start-up that manages comments sections for 4 million sites, including those for Breitbart News, Radix Journal and Occidental Dissent, sells advertising alongside the comments. It has been trying to work through the issues raised by inflammatory content, said chief executive Daniel Ha, adding that the company has been flooded with complaints about hate speech from users, advertisers and employees. "User-generated content has always been extremely chaotic, and that's part of what makes the Internet so amazing - you can share very unpopular ideas," Ha said. "I think, however, that we've seen in the last year that there's a bigger responsibility for how that affects society." The company's terms and conditions prohibit instances of "extreme discrimination" on its comment boards, and a team of 10 reviewers makes the judgment calls. He said the line between "targeted harassment that feels violent" vs. someone making an off-color joke isn't always clear. In a blog post last month, the company announced a new tool that allows users to flag offensive comments. But the software is still largely untested. Ha said he had blocked three of the extremist sites after being contacted by The Post. One of them, the neo-Confederate site Occidental Dissent, used the development to make a public call for more donations, earning what site founder Brad Griffin said was about $1,000 - several times more than the advertisements had produced in recent months. "It worked out nice for me," Griffin said. -- The Washington Post Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

This is a critical time when reviewing your account for areas of improvement and implementing new strategies are required. Here’s seven of the most effective strategies for improving your AdWords performance, all of which have been tried and tested by me. They are ordered by effectiveness, so if you are tight on time, we would suggest implementing 1 and 2 first. 1) Implementing Single Keyword Ad Groups Single keyword ad groups are king when it comes to squeezing more performance out of Adwords. A case study by my company Clicteq showed that they could reduce the cost per conversion by 37.5% and increase AdWords Quality Score from 5.56 to 7.95 out of 10. Most advertisers place 10 to 20 keywords in an ad group, but this makes it very difficult to write ad copy that is relevant to all of the different keywords within the ad group. Instead if you place just one keyword per ad group, you can write ads that are incredibly specific to that keyword, as you know the exact keyword that will trigger the advert to be displayed. Higher relevance = Higher CTR = Higher Quality Score = More conversions + lower cost per conversion. To get started with single keyword ad groups, you need to place each of your keywords within their own ad group in all the different match types as shown below. One you have done this, you then need to create adverts that are incredibly specific to the keywords within the ad group. We would suggest you use a template that looks something like this: Headline 1: Your keyword Headline 2: Features and benefits Description: Features and benefits + Call to action Display URL: Your Keyword Here is an example of an advertiser doing this well. You can see that they have included the keyword “blue men’s socks” within the headline of the advert and the display URL. They have then used the rest of the ad copy to effectively convey their features and benefits and have included a strong call to action telling users what to do next. 2) Segmenting Shopping Campaigns by Product IDs Google gives you several different ways to segment your product feed. But for most advertisers, unless you have an inventory of tens of thousands of products, you’ll want to segment your shopping feed by product ID. Segmenting your products into smaller groups is important. Otherwise, all of your products would have the same bid and share the same negative keywords, which is far from optimal. To get a strong ROI from Google Shopping campaigns you need to set bids that are relative to the price of the product. For example, if you run an online shop that sells shoes, you might be happy bidding $1 per click when you have a margin of $100 but you’re almost certainly going to lose money bidding $1 per click if you have a $5 margin. Segmenting by ID works by placing each product within its own ad group as shown below. When PPC Hero tested segmenting by product ID, they increased conversion rates by 230% and decreased their cost per sale by 85% compared to their All Products campaign. 3) Social Proof Your Adverts for Higher Conversion Rates Social proof does not only work for your landing pages, you can use it for your ads, too. There are two main ways to social proof your adverts: You can add seller rating extensions or you can add review extensions. Review extensions allow you to display a third party review alongside your adverts as shown below, which generally increases CTR by around 10-15%. They can be added within the AdWords interface itself. Seller ratings extensions are the second way in which you can social proof your ads, and have been shown to increase conversion rates by 4.9% with 50+ positive reviews. Below is an example of River Island using them effectively. They are automatically placed next to your adverts once you have 150 positive reviews on one of Google’s approved review platforms. 4) Use Countdown Timers to Create Urgency for Offers A very useful but heavily underused feature within AdWords is the countdown timer feature that allows you to display an accurate countdown within your ad copy to create urgency and increase conversion rates. Here is an example of an advertiser using one: Research has shown that implementing this feature increased CTR from 2.87% to 4.02%, and there was a $3.66 decrease in cost per conversion. They also saw that conversions increased dramatically as the number of days until the sale ended decreased. The graph below shows that conversion rates increased from 8.24% to 10.80% at the peak of the sale period. 5) Automate Your Split Testing at Scale One big problem that a lot of e-commerce AdWords users find is they can’t keep track of all their ad tests when there are thousands or even tens of thousands of ads within their account. The key to effective split testing is to test based on statistical significance so you ensure that you have enough data to make the correct call. Otherwise, you might choose an advert that appears to be a winner but might after a few more clicks turn out not to be as effective. When you have a few adverts, you can simply place the number of clicks that your adverts have had and their respective CTR into a calculator like the one below, and it will tell you if your ad tests have reached statistical significance. But when you have 10,000 ads it’s not that simple. At this point, you need to use automation to keep track of all of your split tests for you. There is a large range of products out there, such as Adalysis or Optmyzr that allow you to do this. These tools will track if there are enough clicks to make a decision effortlessly across tens of thousands of adverts, and will even let you queue adverts so when an ad test has finished, a new ad copy will automatically replace the losing ad copy. 6) Create Adverts for Every Product That You Stock For the best results with AdWords, you need to create adverts right down to individual advert level. If you have a small product inventory, you can do this manually. However, if you have a larger inventory that changes regularly then this might not be possible and you may need to turn to automation. This is where a feature called dynamic search ads comes into their own. They work in a similar way to Google shopping ads in the sense that there are no keywords; Google instead decides when your product will be displayed. The campaigns work by allowing you to create an advert template like the one below, then Google inserts a dynamically created headline so the advert is closely related to your product page. These allow you to get a much better coverage right down to product level. They have come a long way since the original dynamic search ads, and you now have much more control by creating category specific adverts and using extensive negative keyword lists to ensure you don’t appear for any irrelevant searchers. For enterprise class AdWords users that are spending over $100K / month, there is something called inventory-aware campaigns by Google DoubleClick that allow for much more control. The tool allows you to create keywords and adverts based on your product feed using ad templates. Advertisers have seen impressive results, with conversions increasing by as much as 26%. 7) Use RLSA for Your Google Shopping Campaigns Most advertisers now are using remarketing to bring back users who have not converted the first time they viewed their website using banner ads. However, not many of them use remarketing to show their Google Shopping ads more often. Wordsteam has recently published a case study about their research into applying RLSA to Google Shopping campaigns and their results are significant. They saw increases in shopping CTR and conversion rates by as much as 400% for some of their segments. You can implement RLSA in your Google Shopping campaigns in the same way that you would implement them into a search campaign within the audience tab. Conclusion If you want to squeeze more performance out of your e-commerce AdWords campaigns then implementing the seven strategies that have been covered in today’s article will be a great first move. The vast majority of advertisers are not using all seven of these strategies. In fact, most don’t even use half of these strategies so it represents a huge area for improvement and a great way to get ahead of your competition. If you have any questions please feel free to ask them on social media and I will get back to you. Image Credits Featured Image: pulsar011/DepositPhotos Screenshots by Wesley Parker.

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. ——— AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this story.     Tags: youtube, google, videos, friday, their, google, Other stories from today: Disney CEO: ‘Last Jedi’ not changed due to Fisher’s death Sweet news: Germany’s Haribo to produce gummy bears in U.S. More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Do you think on-demand ride companies like Uber and Lyft are helping with the area's traffic congestion?

Scroll Staff Published Mar 23, 2017.   Twitter Google has handed over the latest version of its operating system – Android O – to developers. However, its official release date has yet to be announced, and the tech giant has not divulged any details of the software yet. Android fans are hopeful that Google will fix the poor battery life trouble users of the OS face. Vice President of Engineering for Android David Burke also confirmed it. “Building on the work we began in Nougat, Android O puts a big priority on improving a user’s battery life,” he said. To achieve this, there will be new limits set to prevent background apps from sapping the battery life, reported The Telegraph. Reports claim that Android O will give users better control over notifications. It will have notification channels such as news, sports, music, etc to avoid overload, according to netmag. Burke told The Verge that there will be “new visuals and grouping to notifications that make it easier for users to see what’s going on when they have an incoming message or are glancing at the notification shade”. The new software promises better audio quality over Bluetooth, as well. The internet giant has also come up with a picture-in-picture display that allows videos to keep playing in a smaller screen while a user browses other sites or performs other functions of the phone. Other upgrades include better Wi-Fi connectivity and keyboard navigation. Before the launch of a new OS, Google is known to get its fans speculating over what the new version of Android will be called. The company usually names them after desserts or candies as is evident from its previous versions – Nougat, Marshmallow, KitKat Lollipop, etc. It is unclear what O in Android O stands for, but there were rumours of the next OS being named after Oreo biscuits.

However, as the company has grabbed a greater share of digital advertising -- and bids for more television ad dollars -- criticism of its stance has grown. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File)   Mark Bergen Bloomberg     Google is giving marketers more control over their online ads after a slew of brands halted spending in the U.K. over concerns about offensive content. The Alphabet Inc. unit also expanded its definition of hate speech under its advertising policy to include vulnerable groups, which includes those discriminated against because of their identify, socioeconomic class or country of origin. The new policies apply to the YouTube online video service and Google's expansive network that serves ads across the web. "We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn't align with their values. So starting today, we're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content," Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a blog announcing the changes late Monday night. The moves are aimed at rebutting criticism the search giant has not done enough to curb hate speech online, but they also thrust Google further into a heated public debate over censorship and political ideologies. The new policies mark a sharp turn for Google, which has historically largely hewed to its position as a neutral host of outside sources of online content. However, as the company has grabbed a greater share of digital advertising -- and bids for more television ad dollars -- criticism of its stance has grown. This came to a head in recent days after the London-based Times newspaper reported ads from marquee brands in the U.K. were running with videos that promoted terrorism or anti-Semitism. Several marketers pulled their ads from Google properties in the country in response. "We have strict policies that define where Google ads should appear, and in the vast majority of cases, our policies and tools work as intended," Schindler wrote. "But at times we don't get it right." Google's changes give advertisers two key new capabilities. The first introduces a default setting for those starting a marketing campaign. When they sign up, Google will automatically exclude websites and videos deemed "potentially objectionable." The second feature offers more granular control over where advertisers place ads. That will make it easier to exclude content and for advertisers to fine-tune where they want their ads to appear. With each tweak, Google hopes to give advertisers more responsibility over where their ads show up online. The rise of automated, or programmatic, ad-serving has complicated this process. Of course, Google, the world's largest digital advertiser, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend. Additionally, Google is bringing more safeguards for advertisers against spam video accounts on YouTube, while increasing staff to enforce its content policies for advertising. The more dramatic Google decision, however, involves online speech. Its prior ads policy was fairly boilerplate, restricting content that contains harassment and incites violence against groups based on race, religion or gender identity. The company said it's broadening what statements it considers incendiary to include speech it defines as humiliating and demeaning to targeted groups. For example, that could affect websites that talk about how women shouldn't shouldn't learn math or belong in the kitchen The timing and implementation of the new policies is still being set, a spokeswoman said. Eventually, Google plans to disable ads based on these criteria on individual Web pages rather than entire publications, the spokeswoman added. The ad boycott in the U.K. came amid growing anxiety among publishers and media buyers about Google and Facebook's rising share of the digital ad market. Google faces multiple antitrust investigations in the European Union, with several publishers and advertisers in the region complaining about its power. The U.K. accounted for $7.8 billion of Alphabet's sales in 2016, or 8.6 percent. Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, downgraded Alphabet stock on Monday in response to the British boycott. "Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe," he wrote before Google's policy changes. "We expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings." The sharp response from Google's advertisers is also due to the political climate, marketing buyers said. Both Google and Facebook have taken steps to cut funding for sites that spread hate speech and misinformation after the controversial aftermath of the U.S. election. But they are both still criticized for falling short. Advertisers, meanwhile, are increasingly concerned with staying out of any political conflicts. "We're just in a very divisive time," said Sam Bloom, general manager for Camelot Communications, a firm that works with media buyers. "No brand wants to get the Scarlet Letter."

Google confirmed the existence of the app after we asked about it, and told us that (for now) is an experiment, one of many it’s running. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 143.95 +3.07 +2.18% But it sounds like Google may be downplaying this a bit. According to our sources, one plan had been to launch the app during its I/O event in May — much as it did last year with Duo and Allo — although from what we understand right now there is no specific date set. Could the announcement this week of Clips from Apple, a video editing app that will also use AI, image recognition and speech recognition, also have played a part in deciding timing? We also don’t know what name Google is planning for it, but here is what we do know. The approach the developers are taking is not to make “yet another messaging app” but more of a collaborative social photo app. Users can create groups for sharing pictures. And then group members would all be able to edit and tag the same pictures. Alongside this, Google would apply some of its own computer vision expertise and technology — currently used across services like YouTube, Google’s image search, and Google Photos — to help users along: it will be able to identify objects in a photo to tag them and organise them and in the future search for them, as well as to help edit and apply filters to the pictures. We think some of the photo features in the app sound a lot like Clips, the app that Apple is planning to release in April that will use  “They are building a competitor to Path,” is how one person we know described it, in reference to the social app founded by Dave Morin, the investor who also was an early employee at Facebook; and Shawn Fanning and Dustin Mireau, both formerly of Napster. Path gained some early popularity for providing a way for small groups of friends to share pictures and chat with each other, one of the early counterbalances to the more open-ended, share-everything tendencies on services like Twitter and Facebook. In a little twist of what might have been, Google even tried to buy it. But as is often the way with apps, Path eventually waned in popularity. It was eventually sold to Korean messaging giant Kakao in 2015 (it’s still around btw). Google has had a very patchy history when it comes to social media, and it’s an area that the company still trying to get right. The current strategy seems to be one of running a bunch of slightly different apps and efforts simultaneously to see what works, and what does not (which could be one reason why this was worked on as a separate app rather than, say, as part of an update to Google Photos). While Allo and Duo continue to get updates, Spaces — a group app for sharing and exploring links to things by tapping into other existing Google services, which seems closest to what it’s trying to build in the app that’s being tested now — closed down after less than a year. Then there is G+, still going but not the social networking magnet that Google once envisioned it could be. Google Wave, Google Buzz and Orkut are among the various efforts that have come and gone after failing to get enough traction. Why keep returning to social? Because Google faces competition from the likes of Facebook, Twitter and now Snapchat for consumers’ — and thus advertisers’ — attention. Many (not all but many) users today do not think of search engines first when looking for information, deciding how to spend their money, and finding things to entertain themselves. They go to these other apps, and that ultimately can cut into Google’s mainstay advertising business and revenues. YouTube, with its focus on user-generated videos mixed with premium content like Vevo, remains Google’s most successful social play, although it’s known more for ushering in virally popular material rather than for helping to keep the conversation going around it (although Google does do some of that, too, in videos’ comments section). The fact that Google is considering how it can leverage some of the tech that’s been built to help power image search on YouTube, its search portal and its Photos app, to see if that can be used to get a foothold in social is interesting. As is the timing: Apple will be releasing its own gentle step into social media apps — Clips, which lets you edit videos and then share them on various social networks — in April.

Some advertisers said they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Walmart said in a Friday statement. Read more Google promises closer policing of websites The company, alongside PepsiCo and several others, said they will also stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites, AP reported. Verizon and AT&T, along with UK retailer Marks and Spencer and L'Oreal, pulled ads from YouTube earlier this week. AT&T said it is removing the ads from the non-search inventory on Google because its “ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” the company wrote in an email, Reuters reported. If the search giant fails to win back advertisers, this could potentially result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. “The bigger risk is this seems to be a backlash against programmatic advertising in general,” analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research told Reuters on Thursday. “There's this worry that you no longer have control over where ads appear,”he added. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube, AP reported. The Wall Street Journal found that Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing extremist content. Speaking at a press briefing at the start of Advertising Week Europe in London on Monday, Google apologized for tainting some brands, and pledged to ensure the ads will not appear alongside extremist videos. Read more Google to fight city-wide warrant for search data in Minnesota fraud case “It is a good opportunity for me to say, first and foremost, to say sorry this should not happen and we need to do better," Google's EMEA president of business and operations, Matt Brittin, said. Google relies mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos. The company’s EMEA president of business and operations, Matt Brittin, said 400 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube each minute, adding that 98 percent of “removals” take place within 24 hours, NBC reported. Ensuring brand safety, however, is a real challenge, Brittin noted. “It is not as simple as it might seem, so you might say: Why don't you just exclude content that relates to war or that relates to politics? Well actually if you were to do that you would exclude important news content or documentary content.” “It's not our job to be a censor, it's for the government,” Brittin said, as cited by Business Insider. “So, you will find online content that you violently disagree with, that you find incredibly distasteful, but that is a legitimate point of view and not illegal. And that is one of the joys of the web and the voices that are there. That's different to the issue of what's safe for advertisers, which is more tightly defined.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.

Yes, we are talking about the new Android version ‘O’, of which developer preview images were made available on March 21st, 2017. At the initial stage, the images are available only for Nexus Player, 6P, 5X and Pixel, Pixel C, XL. So, it is indeed good news for android app developers. If you own any of these devices you can download them by clicking here. Call it bridging the gap between mobile apps and mobile web, or the dawn of a newly defined app world, the concept of Android Instant Apps, by all means, is grabbing attention globally. Android 8.0 Oreo Release Date As of now, only the features and the developer preview images are shared and there is no fixed date for the release of Android O. However, Google did share a release timeline, which is as follows: However, we are expecting to have a glimpse of the first developer version at the Google’s I/O Developer Conference which is scheduled for May 17-19. It is also believed that at the same time, the search-engine giant will officially confirm the details. Features in Android O 1. Background Limits With the launch of Android Oreo, Google is focusing on saving the battery life of user smartphones and on intelligent execution. To do this, they decided to put restrictions on the processes which applications perform incognito. The three regions include: foundation administrations, area refreshes, and verifiable communicates. With a proper execution of these progressions, the insignificant effects on the user’s device and its battery life will eventually be minimized. 2. Notification Channels This feature will give extra control on notifications enabling users to customize the notifications they receive from mobile applications. Thus, you can now block the unnecessary information which the app provides, and can save a lot of time for your daily routine. Apart from this, even the developers will be able to change the way their app notification interacts with the user by changing its background color. This not only can help prioritize the notification but will also allow them to add some extra content into the collapsed form. 3. Autofill APIs With Android O, Google is introducing Autofill APIs that will allow you to securely store your details like address information, contact details, passwords, etc. Users can select data-storing apps which can play the role of their autofill app. 4. Picture-in-Picture Let us suppose you have an important email waiting to be read, but you also don’t wish to pause your video to move back to your mailbox. Android O introduces a Picture-in-Picture feature, which allows you to keep watching the video while reading/replying to that important email. This becomes possible by keeping the video at the bottom of your phone’s screen in the form of a small window. Thus, you won’t have to stop watching your favorite video every time you have some other important work to do. 5. Adaptive Icons This is another feature which will impact the user experience with its adaptive look. To date, we have seen that the mobile apps we download from the app store often throws off the way we've designed or arranged our home screen. The custom OS skins will now get retreated through adaptive icons, which will transform their shape automatically, keeping in mind your home screen theme. This multi-shape options available include a circle, square, rounded square, or any other thing which will help make your home screen look better. 6. Connectivity Gone are the days of tangling wires of earbuds and cans, smartphone users today prefer connectivity through Bluetooth. Google has proved that they understand the changing user needs and are prepared to remold themselves for better service. With the release of Android 8.0, people will have their devices loaded with ‘high-quality Bluetooth codecs,’ which not only will improve the quality of wireless cans but will also provide Hi-Res Audio Playback over Bluetooth by utilizing Sony’s LDAC technology. To make this happen, Sony, in fact, became a major partner and contributed by providing over 30 feature enhancements and 250 bug fixes to date. How to Install the Android O Beta Now that we know about when it’ll come and what all it’ll be offering to the users, let us learn how to install the update once it’s available. Here’s the process: Visit the site. Choose your Nexus/Pixel device on which you’d like to enroll the beta version. Check if your handset shows the ‘system update’ notification. Download and install the update. Wait till your smartphone reboots. Your Pixel/Nexus device is now loaded with Android O. Learn how divergent branches can appear in your repository and how to better understand why they are called “branches".  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  Like This Article?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Android Security was better in 2016, but there is no rest for Google in this area By John Hoff - March 25, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google recently released its yearly review of Android Security for 2016, and it says that the situation has gotten marginally better last year. But Google has set for itself a target of cleaning up “unwanted software” in 2017, so this means that the fight to secure Android will be a continuous task. Google says that the overall install rate of “potentially harmful apps” (PHAs) has steadily been on the decrease on Android phones, starting from 2014 through 2016. This report came out in the mothership’s 2016 Android Security Year in Review. “The decrease in PHA install rate is primarily due to campaigns to clean up apps in the Ghost Push family,” Google said. In 2015, Google set up the monthly security update initiative after the Stagefright vulnerability was discovered. This initiative was expanded in 2016, the report says. The updates were released for devices running Android 4.4.4 and up, which is around 86 percent of all active Android devices globally. But Google also recognizes a distinct risk for “unwanted software” on Android phones, which they will be aggressively battling in 2017. “This trend is one of the reasons that we introduced the MUwS (Mobile Unwanted Software) classification and are working to enforce new policies for MUwS in 2017,” the report said. MUwS were defined as apps that collected information about installed applications, information about third-party accounts, or names of files on the device without the consent of the user. Google expects to narrow down this definition more in 2017.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT BUSINESS Is UX the new ‘going to the gym’? 3 days ago28 Shares Are you as reluctant to go to the gym as this little guy? Image: Brian Goodman/Shutterstock The importance of UX to a business is undeniable, but are we guilty of putting it on the long finger? Gareth Dunlop investigates. I have been interested in user experience (UX) for more than a decade and have been selling it on an almost daily basis for the last five-and-a-bit years. Since launching a dedicated UX agency, there has been a direct relationship between my ability to sell UX and my ability to eat. In the simplest possible terms, if I don’t sell, none of us in the agency eat. So it’s a topic I spend quite a bit of time thinking about. In those last five years, I have met organisations across every conceivable sector and size; from large enterprises to micro-SMEs; from the most ambitious corporates to public service providers to the not-for-profit sector. Their online goals have varied from e-commerce ambitions to software-as-a-service delivery; from generating a B2B lead-generation engine to customer support and self-service. And even though I haven’t closed every deal I’ve chased, I have never met anyone who doesn’t believe in UX. No one has told me it’s a bad idea or a dire way to think about design. Occasionally, a prospective client will use a competitor but, more often than not, those who don’t engage just ‘crack on with the design and build process’ in the hope that what emerges from that will meet their customers’ needs. While our prospects haven’t verbalised this sentiment directly, it’s clear that some see UX as something that would be nice to do. Some day. When they’ve got the budget. When business is so good, they can get the Rolls Royce solution. It sounds like an academic exercise perhaps; something that someone who was a little too straight-laced would do as part of design. UX is like going to the gym. It’s something that’s nice to do and has a benefit. But we’ll get to it another time. ‘Understanding your online customer is a fundamental commercial imperative, without which design is, at best, merely guesswork’ In such cases, I am always aware that I have possibly failed to communicate the overwhelming business case for investing in your users. This is a real shame because I am increasingly convinced that understanding your online customer is a fundamental commercial imperative, without which design is, at best, merely guesswork. A project must establish its ‘true north’ based on business objectives, related KPIs and user needs before design and development starts. Even a cursory look at the world’s leading digital products will give strong hints about how they view their relationships with their users (spoiler alert: borderline obsessional). Jeff Bezos invested 100 times more into customer experience than advertising during the first year of Amazon. A few years later, Larry and Sergey published their Google manifesto under the heading ‘Ten Things We Know to be True’. This manifesto hasn’t changed in 20 years and the first thing they knew to be true was: focus on the user and all else will follow. Since its inception, Google has focused on providing the best user experience possible. While many companies claim to put their customers first, few are able to resist the temptation to make small sacrifices to increase shareholder value. ‘By always placing the interests of the user first, Google has built the most loyal audience on the web’ – GOOGLE Google is so fixated on this truth that their VC division, Google Ventures, will not invest in a company that doesn’t enshrine the principles of UX and, in particular, Lean UX, as part of their design and development DNA. Forrester summarised its view of the industry: “When compared to their peers, the top 10 companies leading in customer experience outperformed the S&P index with close to triple the returns.” The business case varies slightly from opportunity to opportunity, and from marketplace to marketplace, but the fundamentals are consistent: If you don’t understand your users as part of the design process, you are guessing. Not only do you have to design the thing right, you have to design the right thing. Your business is highly likely to fail without happy customers. You need to treat them well online or they will go to competitors, or just go do something else instead. Investing in customers in a B2B context increases website conversion, expressed in phone calls, enquiry form completions, brochure downloads and demo bookings. Understanding users in a B2C environment drives up conversion rate, average order value, lifetime value of customer and likelihood of repeat visits. Valuing customers drives down the cost of customer service, allowing them to self-serve online, getting answers quicker and reducing costs in expensive support centres. UX enhances your brand within its marketplace and can become a genuine source of competitive advantage. It feels fitting that the final word should belong to the two Google guys, who perhaps know more about profitable digital ventures than anyone else in the world: “Google has steadfastly refused to make any change that does not offer a benefit to the users who come to the site. “By always placing the interests of the user first, Google has built the most loyal audience on the web. And that growth has come not through TV ad campaigns, but through word of mouth from one satisfied user to another.” By Gareth Dunlop Gareth Dunlop owns and runs Fathom, a user-experience consultancy which helps ambitious organisations get the most from their website and internet marketing by viewing the world from the perspective of their customers.

By Agamoni Ghosh March 25, 2017 11:33 GMT Google Hangouts latest updateGetty Images The archaic Google Talk, which most of us start chatting with after opening our first Gmail accounts, is going to retire soon. The company plans to replace the messenger popularly known as 'Gchat' with Hangouts. Post June 26 users who have not updated their Gmail suites to include Hangouts, will be automatically forced to opt out of Google Talk and switch to Hangouts. The Google Talk app will also be discontinued. While it's not a major change for most, it is curtains drawn on the nostalgic messenger that has been around since the early 2000s, a time when desktop messengers ruled. But with smartphones taking a significant chunk of internet usage, companies have had to reinvent their products to suit the changing needs. Google in fact has quite a few chat apps now so much so that it's confusing what it wants to establish. While Hangouts is still the predominant messenger used, Google Duo and Allo were also introduced last year. While Duo aims users who frequently use video or audio chat, Allo has been promoted as a new age smart messenger with in-built Google Assistant for users help. Google also announced that it would replace SMS on Android devices with Android messages. "We want to provide a consistent and easy-to-use SMS experience for Android users, right out of the box. So we're focused on making Android Messages the primary place to access SMS and are working with carriers and device manufacturers to include Android Messages natively in Android devices," said the company in its official blog.

Secondly, SMS support is being pulled from Google Hangouts, an app that is now being positioned as more of a business-focused tool for your workplace group chat needs. However, ordinary, non-paying users will be able to carry on using Hangouts (minus the SMS feature) for the time being. This isn't really a big surprise: messages inside Hangouts have been pushing users towards Android Messenger for SMS for more than a year now, and support for the vintage messaging format might even get added to the Allo app eventually. SMS options in Hangouts will disappear from May 22. Leaving the labs Thirdly, some of those weird and wonderful Labs experiments in Gmail are getting removed too, from April 24. Quick Links, which lets you bookmark certain pages in Gmail, and Smart Labels, where incoming emails are sorted automatically, are among those features getting the boot (a more advanced version of Smart Labels is now embedded in the main Gmail apps anyway). Google says the changes will help it "focus and prioritize" on the features and apps it thinks are more important. While the note was written to users of the G Suite business set of apps, you can expect to see the same updates filter down to everyone. Google's approach to messaging could certainly use some tidying up, with three Google-made messaging apps available on Android alone. Perhaps one day it will get around to rolling everything into one all-powerful tool, but that day is still a long way off.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 03.25.17. 03.25.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am YouTube’s Ad Problems Finally Blow Up in Google’s Face WIRED Late last year, Israel-based entrepreneur Matan Uziel saw a notification he’d never seen before pop up on YouTube’s backend—the part of the site where creators upload their videos. “I saw a yellow dollar sign. At first I didn’t understand what it was,” Uziel says. “Then I moved my cursor over it. I saw it meant my video was not advertiser-friendly.” By then, Uziel had made and posted close to a dozen videos to a YouTube channel called Real Women Real Stories—women speaking frankly into a camera about their experiences of sexual abuse. The view counts on some of the videos had climbed into the thousands, qualifying them for pre-roll ads placed through YouTube’s advertising program. They were bringing Uziel and his team a modest amount of money. But Google was now pulling the plug. The company would not let ads run on his latest video—and eventually all the others. The problem, he was told: the “sensitive nature” of the videos. Related Stories Charley Locke The Tricky Art of Podcast Ads Is About to Get Even Trickier Davey Alba Under Pressure to Prove Its Ads Actually Work, Google Opens Up Davey Alba PewDiePie’s Anti-Semitic Videos Put YouTube’s Business in a Bind Davey Alba The Best Way to Quash Fake News? Choke Off Its Ad Money Uziel sent an appeal to Google, but the company denied it. A Google representative told Uziel in an email that the videos’ titles could be automatically triggering the site’s filters. But Uziel says he never got a full explanation from the company of what really got the ads pulled from his videos. That same confusion simmers at the heart of Google’s current ad debacle. Over the past week, major advertisers—everyone from the British government to AT&T—have pulled their ad buys from YouTube after their banners appeared over videos posted by extremists. Google has apologized. But the company still has a more basic transparency problem. Google ostensibly wants to make sure uploaders of hate speech and abuse don’t get paid. But as Uziel’s experience demonstrates, that effort can come at the expense of deserving content. The opacity around Google’s standards and practices, as reflected in their inconsistent enforcement, creates uncertainty at the heart of one of the internet’s most popular services. Until Google truly fixes the problem, the internet—and one of its core business models—will suffer. Ditching Google About a week ago, the Times of London published an investigation revealing ads sponsored by the British government and several private sector companies had appeared ahead of YouTube videos supporting terrorist groups. In response, advertisers started pulling their spending from YouTube and the wider Google ad network. The boycott has grown as more problems have emerged. PepsiCo and Wal-Mart have now joined the ranks of advertisers pulling dollars from Google. Google for its part has said it is examining its policies and renewing its commitment to better police content. It will accelerate reviews of potentially objectionable videos and filter more ads while giving advertisers more control over where their ads appear. Related Video Inside the Fake News Factory of Macedonia “While we recognize that no system will be 100 percent perfect, we believe these major steps will further safeguard our advertisers’ brands,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said in a statement. To be sure, Google faces major technical challenges in policing where ads appear. Users upload as much as 400 hours of content to YouTube every minute. And millions of websites rely on the company’s platform to funnel ads to their sites. But claiming sheer logistics doesn’t satisfy everyone in the ad world as an excuse. After all, no other company has done better at making money off of performing technical feats at a massive scale. Google may be reluctant to stand between publishers and advertisers for fear of becoming too much of an arbiter of what’s appropriate. But it also makes a lot of money off of ads in part by making the path from advertiser to targeted audience eyeballs as efficient as possible. “It’s difficult to understand what motivates Google,” says one advertising executive who did not want to be seen publicly criticizing a company with which nearly all advertisers have to work. “When you’ve operated a marketplace, or owned and operated inventory that’s been so noncompliant with basic standards for so long, you can’t erase that mark overnight.” Hot Topic Google’s ad system has long suffered from these weaknesses. But ever since Facebook admitted to flaws in how it reported ad performance to ad buyers, digital advertising has come under greater scrutiny, says media analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research. On top of that, advertisers fear being seen as subsidizers of the festering scourge of fake news. “If it wasn’t obvious before that Google’s ad inventory was problematic, now it is,” Wieser says. And now Google has little choice but to try to fix it. Just a few advertisers control so many of the ad dollars, and they’ve been primed by recent events to be more conscientious about brand safety. Pressure from them could push Google to become more consistent and careful about what it allows on its platforms and where it allows ads to appear. “We draw a sharp distinction between free speech and the right to do business with a private company,” says Josh Zeitz, vice president of communications at AppNexus, which last year blocked Breitbart News from using its ad-serving tools after it determined the site violated AppNexus’ hate speech policy. “We have our advertisers’ brand safety to look after, and we have a moral code to live by. If we won’t work with a publisher, that doesn’t stop them from directly selling ads to advertisers.” Matan Uziel of Real Women Real Stories hopes YouTube figures out that its content provides an important service, that the money paid by advertisers supports his ability to produce videos that provide women a place to speak out on a difficult subject. It might be sensitive, but it serves a public good. Until Google can start better making these distinctions, both advertisers and creators will have trouble trusting the company. Go Back to Top.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Ng Han Guan/AP/REX/Shutterstock Here are the six features in Android O that you’ll actually care about Chris Mills @chrisfmills March 21st, 2017 at 4:51 PM Share Tweet The developer preview of Android O has launched today, giving a lucky (and brave) few an advance look at the next version of Android. It will be some months until we start seeing Android O roll out across all Android devices, but now we at least know what we’re missing out on. Don't Miss: Now is the perfect time to buy an iPhone SE Better battery life and performance It’s difficult to wave a magic wand to make everything on a phone run better and for longer, but that’s what Google is trying to do with Android O, via the magic of background apps. Google is targeting a few key areas where apps running in the background of your phone are using too much resources to basically do nothing, and making things better. The video below explains the problem of implicit broadcasts, one of the biggest problems Google is trying to address. Implicit broadcasts are when an app or service on the phone announces an event that might be of interest to other apps or services, for example when your phone reconnects to the internet after a period of lost connectivity. Those broadcasts wake up many dormant apps, and are a large part of the reason your phone’s battery dies weirdly quickly when you have spotty cell coverage. The other areas being targeted are background services and location services. Those are both features that developers have started using more recently, and the changes mostly look like they’re designed to optimize and streamline. It’s good news for Android users, although it means even more work for developers. Higher-quality audio Thanks to a partnership with Sony, Google will be integrating new Bluetooth technologies into Android O that allow for higher-quality wireless music. Given the current trend of axing headphone jacks, anything that makes Bluetooth music better is good news, and Sony’s tech is some of the best in the business. The big feature is LDAC support. LDAC is a proprietary Sony encoding system that promises better, higher-bitrate music transmission over a regular Bluetooth connection. It does require hardware that supports LDAC, which really just means Sony headphones and speakers at this point. But with free integration into Android, there’s a good chance that we’ll start seeing more LDAC headphones in the future. It also raises a worrying point, which is that we might be at the beginning of a Bluetooth unravelling. Apple’s newest wireless headphones (like the Airpods) have quick-connection features that don’t work on Android devices. If Android devices start supporting proprietary encoding methods that don’t work on iOS, it’s easy to see the currently-universal Bluetooth system devolving into a mess of competing codecs and compatibility, which would be a shame. Notifications that don’t suck One of my biggest complaints whenever I use an Android phone are the litany of unnecessary notifications. Multiple notifications from the same app are a particularly dumb kind of irritation, so it’s awesome news that Google is actually fixing this. In Android O, notifications will be grouped together to help bring down the total number of notifications. Even better, you’ll be able to choose what kinds of notifications you want. High-priority, low-priority and “marketing” will all be different options, which is good news because it means I might be able to finally disable Postmates offers about free delivery for good. Picture-in-picture videos If you’ve used the YouTube app on any device in the last year, you’ll be familiar with picture-in-picture viewing. Basically, it lets you resize a video to a small box in the corner while you’re still able to browse around the device. It’s ideal for keeping an eye on something while doing something else, so Google is making it possible for videos system-wide. Keyboard support Anyone using an Android phone probably won’t care about this, but it’s superb news for Chromebook users. Basically, Google is adding better support for using keyboards to navigate Android apps. In particular, this means things like arrow keys and tab can be used to navigate through Android apps. I’ve been using a Chromebook for work lately, and the one thing stopping Android app support from being great is that you can’t tab through different fields when filling out forms. This fixes that. Much better VOIP apps Buried in the change notes is news about a “telecom framework,” which will let VOIP apps act like the device’s main telephone app. Currently, only the conventional phone app can trigger most of the features associated with voice calls, but this framework will enable any (authorized) app to work as the main phone app. This is a huge upgrade for anyone who uses a VOIP app over a data plan to make phone calls. For example, Google Hangouts offers free calling to any number in the US or Canada, so I use that to avoid any long-distance fees, or to make much cheaper overseas calls. The telecoms framework should mean more VOIP apps fill out with features, and more people can ditch their carrier-provided number. This is a good thing for customers, and awful news for any cell carriers still making money selling a $20-per-month talk-only plan.

Not only does it have an unlimited supply of information, but the apps they produce are used by millions of people every day. Now, one of its most popular apps, Google Maps, has brought in a new feature which means you can track your friends and family. It means you can use the app to broadcast your location in real time- letting friends, relatives or even a spouse know where you are. Those concerned about privacy might not be too quick to enable the feature. Thankfully, it's not a mandatory setting. In order to share your location, you have to have your phone's GPS-enabled location tracker switched on. More news: Hull dad abducts daughters and takes them to Egypt From there, you can tap on the blue dot that represents you and choose "share location" - and set how long you want it shared for. Google Maps will then give you the option to share to contacts directly through the app or via a link through your normal messenger apps. "When you're sharing your location, the people you've chosen to share with will see you on their map," a spokesperson for Google said. "You'll see an icon above the compass on your own map reminding you that you're actively sharing your location. "You can change your mind and stop sharing at any time - it's entirely up to you." If you keep your location shared indefinitely then Google will send you an email every three weeks to remind you that it's activated.

Google Might Be Working on a New Social App for Groups to Edit Pictures GO Google could introduce the new social-media app soon Mar 25, 2017 10:12 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google constantly brings new features and tools to users of its social communication apps, Allo and Duo. The two applications recently received updates with audio-only calls and file sharing options, but that’s not all that Google has been working on. A recent rumor says that Google might be planning to introduce a new social app that allows small groups of users to edit pictures together and organize them in multiple ways. It’s a combination between Snapchat filters and advanced imaging features. Google has apparently confirmed that it is working on such an app, but says that it’s currently an experiment. There’s no guarantee that the app will eventually make it to the Play Store and that users of Android-running smartphones will be able to check it out. Collaborative social photo app The report reveals that Google plans to introduce the new app during Google I/O this year, but the company is still undecided upon the app’s name. Apparently, the new app will be a competitor to Path and allow users to create groups for sharing pictures and editing them. It would be some sort of a collaborative social photo app that combines features for identifying objects in a photo, organizing them and applying filters. Path is an application for providing small groups of friends the means to share pictures and chat. Google was at one point interested in buying Path, but it was eventually sold to Korean messaging giant Kakao in 2015. While Google constantly updates and promotes Allo and Duo, the two apps didn’t do so well among consumers, despite Allo receiving integration with Google Assistant. Google is facing fierce competition from other giants like Facebook and Snapchat, while YouTube remains the social giant’s most successful social endeavor. Still, Google did attract users in the business field with its G Suite apps, which offer plenty of tools for co-workers to collaborate on projects and record their progress. #Google#Allo#Duo#Play Store#Social media subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Is Reportedly Killing Hangouts Text Messaging Feature Google Updates Duo with Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Google Assistant in Allo App Can Reveal Your Search History to Friends Gboard for Android Updated with New Emojis, GIF Suggestions, Live Translations Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Samsung Store in Singapore Catches Fire Ahead of Galaxy S8 Unveil All 2017 iPhones to Support Wireless Charging, Apple Watch to Feature LTE How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update RTM Right Now Survey: 93% of Millennials Aren't Quitting Uber Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Latest Black Lab Linux Weekly Build Optimizes Swap File Management for SSD Windows 10, the Only Way to Go: 8 in 10 Companies to Install the OS, Study Shows    Google logo New Android APKs Growtopia APK: Updated March 28th, 11:49 GMT feedly APK: Updated March 28th, 11:46 GMT Night Owl APK: Updated March 28th, 11:44 GMT NewsTab APK: Updated March 28th, 11:41 GMT Star Trek Timelines APK: Updated March 28th, 11:36 GMT Khan Academy APK: Updated March 28th, 11:32 GMT N.O.V.A.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Published:March 25, 2017 4:09 pm “Talk users within Gmail will receive a prompt in the next few weeks, inviting them to switch to Hangouts,” Google said in a blog post. Google is killing off Google Talk, which will now be replaced by Hangouts. GTalk was unveiled in 2005 “as a simple chat experience between Gmail users.” The search giant started to replace GTalk with Hangouts back in 2013. Further, Hangouts is being updated to add Meet and Chat features. Until now, users could choose in between GTalk and Hangouts. Now, Google is completely killing off GTalk. Users have until June 26, after which they’ll be automatically transitioned to Hangouts. “Talk users within Gmail will receive a prompt in the next few weeks, inviting them to switch to Hangouts,” Google said in a blog post. Google will remove carrier SMS functionality in Hangouts app for Android starting May 22. The move is aimed at streamlining the product for enterprise users. Users will see a notification in Hangouts app to switch to another SMS app already on their phone for SMS, or to download Android Messages. Switching to a different messaging app will not affect user’s SMS message history and all their messages will be accessible in whichever new app they choose. Google Voice users, on the other hand, may continue to use Hangouts for their Google Voice SMS. In order to make Android Messages the primary place to access SMS, Google is working with carriers and device manufacturers to include Android Messages natively in Android devices. The search giant is looking to upgrade SMS to RCS, which will bring about features like read receipts, group chat, hi-res photo sharing and more.

THE MOST FROM THE COAST ! ..  Coastweek website Home  Coast Classified | Coast Art | Coast Books | Coast Cuisine | Coast Directory | Coast Eating Out | Coast Obituaries | Coast Poster | Shipping | Tides XINHUA NEWS SERVICE REPORTS FROM THE AFRICAN CONTINENT   Google mentorship aims to stimulate growth of Kenyan start-ups NAIROBI (Xinhua) -- Global technology giant Google will scale up mentorship programs targeting Kenyan innovators to enable them to grow their technology start-ups into formidable enterprises, executives said on Friday. John Kimani, Google’s Head of Developer Ecosystem in East and Francophone Africa, said that mentorship is key to enabling young techpreneurs to acquire skills needed in the expansion of their businesses. "This country has an abundant pool of talented web and mobile based application developers who require a supportive ecosystem to make their businesses thrive," said Kimani. He noted that a combination of raw talent, funding, access to infrastructure and markets alongside basic financial literacy are key to stimulating growth of technology based enterprises. Kenyan techpreneurs have benefited from Google’s Launchpad, a mentorship program targeting start-ups in the emerging markets that was launched four years ago. Kimani noted that innovators who have enlisted in this mentorship program have gained expertise on how to refine their early stage businesses and attract investors. "We identify outstanding start-ups, mentor their founders and share best practices across the ecosystem to help build them into successful businesses," Kimani said. He noted that boot camps organized by Google and key partners have provided Kenyan techpreneurs with expertise that is critical to growing their businesses. "Our boot camps for early stage startups focus on problem solving. "They enable developers to come up with a sound strategy to grow their businesses," said Kimani. He added that Google’s flagship mentorship program for techpreneurs has boosted their knowledge of regulatory issues, intellectual property and marketing. Kenya is yet to actualize its dream of becoming a silicon savannah despite abundance of innovators and friendly policies. Kimani noted that majority of technology based start-ups are collapsing in the early stages due to their inability to attract angel investors. "Building a successful technology business in this market is hampered by many obstacles. Currently, only 20 percent of Kenyan start-ups survive to the next stage," said Kimani. He added that Kenya has the potential to attract investors in the technology space if the country prioritized regulatory reforms and skills development.                 Remember: you read it first at coastweek.com !     . n                         Particle Board   MDF   Melamine faced boards   Formica   Kitchens & Wardrobes Door frontals   3mm MDF   Wood based Panels: Chipboard, MDF   Edge banding   Handles, Hinges, Runners and Cabinetry hardware   Motion Furniture fittings & hardware   Dekko flooring   Particle Board . ► Nairobi  Kampala Road, Industrial area                                                   ► Mombasa  Lumumba Road, Mvita                                                   ► Kampala - Uganda  Seventh Street Industrial Area CLICK  ON BANNER FOR DETAILS   TO ADVERTISE ON THIS WEB SITE:  www.coastweek.com Please contact MOMBASA - GULSHAN JIVRAJ, Mobile: 0722 775164 Tel: (+254) (41) 2230130 / Wireless: 020 3549187 e-mail: info@coastweek.com NAIROBI - ANJUM H.

An anti-Semitic clip claiming the existence of a "Jewish World Order" was featured alongside advertisements in Germany from insurer AXA, oil company Total in France, Range Rover vehicles in South Africa, footwear retailer Skopunkten and website Tradera in Sweden, Bloomberg searches of YouTube from each country found on Thursday. The video was also paired with brands in Asia — Castrol lubricants in India and Cow & Gate infant formula in Hong Kong. A separate sermon by preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril, who according to U.S. prosecutors once took credit for a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, can be viewed alongside advertisements from Nissan in Sweden and wireless carrier MTN Group in South Africa. Meanwhile, the Islamophobic English Defence League gathers support from advertisers Total, Netflix, IBM and watchmaker Tag Heuer International in France. The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding across the globe at a pace Alphabet's Google has struggled to match in its response. On Thursday, as Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said Google could "get pretty close" to guaranteeing companies' ads won't be placed near hateful material, advertisers throughout Europe were confronting more than a dozen new examples and scrambling to protect their brands. "We didn't know that our ads were played in this context," Axa spokeswoman Anja Kroll said in an email. "We have immediately arranged for an update of the filters and stopped the delivery" of ads with these videos because "diversity, tolerance and openness are values that are of key importance for us and that we practice daily." While Axa hasn't pulled its ads from YouTube, the German unit is using "blacklist" filters to prevent its ads from appearing next to extremist, racist or other undesired content, Kroll said. In this case, she said, the filters apparently failed. "We don't comment on individual videos but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear," a Google spokesperson said. "We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands." Range Rover said in an email it was suspending its YouTube campaign in South Africa while it investigates. Telenor Sweden, which had an ad showing before a propaganda video from a Swedish neo-Nazi group, also halted all YouTube advertising, according to Aron Samuelsson, a spokesman. Nissan said it was "urgently reviewing" with Google while Nilson Group, owner of Skopunkten, said it had asked its media agency about the ads and is "awaiting answers," according to Linda Fernell, a spokeswoman. Total, IBM, MTN, Tag Heuer, Netflix, Castrol India and Cow&Gate owner Danone didn't respond or had no immediate comment. Tradera's owner, Paypal, declined to comment. In Sweden, an Ikea spot was found alongside a homophobic and anti-Semitic video entitled: "Gay Pride Parade a Tool of International Jews," while another clip in India tied the so-called gay agenda to "Satanic Illuminati" and touted the F3 Plus smartphone from China's Oppo. An ad for HBO's "The Young Pope" found its way to the pre-roll for "Jewish Hypocrisy -- Flooding Europe With Immigrants" in Spain. "It is completely unacceptable that IKEA appears in a context like this," spokeswoman Cecilia Nettelbladt Stenberg said by phone. "What we've done now is to ask our media agency to immediately investigate the reason behind this." "We don't control the YouTube ad placement, but we greatly oppose it," HBO said in an email. "We will be taking steps to get it removed." Oppo didn't respond. The advertisers' discomfort highlights the reliance of Google and Facebook on automated software that maximizes volume to help them dominate online advertising. Digital advertising grew by 17 percent globally to $178 billion in 2016, according to marketing consultant Magna Global, which projects that digital-based ad sales will overtake TV to become the No. 1 media category this year. The global array of companies caught up in the controversy illustrates the scale of the problem for Google, which risks potential financial and reputational damage. The company was already facing claims in a lawsuit by the family of a terror attack victim that it profits from ads linked to terrorist propaganda promoting violence. The latest crisis erupted after a Times of London investigation last week revealed ads running alongside offensive content. Alphabet's market value has dropped by about $24 billion this week. "A cascade of major brand boycotts for Google ad spend (mostly non-search) has emerged, raising concerns on first quarter and second quarter results and the future of programmatic advertising," Justin Post, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note on Thursday, referencing the automated software Google uses to match advertisers with content online. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Ford Motor Co. suspended their YouTube ads on Thursday. AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline and Verizon Communications joined the boycott earlier this week, after British Broadcasting Corp., Sainsbury, Volkswagen and Toyota Motor Corp. said they had pulled ads in the U.K. The latest examples show the global scope of the Google's problem, reaching beyond the U.K. and U.S. to big European markets like Germany, France and Sweden, as well as Hong Kong, India and South Africa. At Skopunkten, a major shoe-store chain in Sweden, spokeswoman Fernell said she was unaware of the "Jewish World Order" video but said the company had noticed some unwanted videos popping up in its YouTube campaigns. "I hope they can help us redirect the ads," she said. "We need to learn more about this." While Google's tools can be incredibly sophisticated, allowing ads to follow users from site to site, the software hasn't fully matched the human judgment necessary to protect brands from inadvertently funneling cash to causes their customers would find objectionable. The high number of intermediaries in digital advertising further complicates the problem. So Google's announced fixes may not completely solve the challenge. "Google isn't yet fully addressing advertisers' concerns and needs to take stronger steps to regain the trust of brands," Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Google said Tuesday that it was increasing safeguards to protect advertisers, such as automatically excluding ads from videos deemed "potentially objectionable" and giving advertisers more control over placement. While YouTube revenue isn't reported separately by Google, analysts estimate the video site brings in billions of dollars each year, and say it's among Google's fastest-growing businesses. Schmidt, in an appearance on Fox Business Network's "Mornings With Maria" on Thursday, said Google can generally ensure clients that their ads won't be placed next to "hate" content. "We match the ads and the content," Schmidt said, according to a transcript from Fox Business. "But because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match." He said that Google had tightened its policies and increased the amount of time it spends manually reviewing the content, "and so I think we're going to be okay."

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday.

Starbucks and Walmart join growing list of advertisers boycotting YouTube Read more In the US, the telecom companies AT&T and Verizon, as well as the pharmaceutical company GSK, Pepsi, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson and the car rental firm Enterprise, have all pulled advertising from Google’s video-sharing platform, a contagion spreading from Europe, where a number of high-profile advertisers pulled out of YouTube following an investigation by the Times. Major brands’ content was found to be appearing next to videos promoting extremist views or hate speech, with a cut of the advertising spend going to the creators. Verizon’s ads were featured alongside videos made by Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghoneim, who was banned from the US over extremism, and the hate preacher Hanif Qureshi, whose preachings were said to have inspired the murder of a politician in Pakistan. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” an AT&T spokesman said in a statement. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate AT&T spokesman Following the exodus of some of its high-profile advertisers, Google has publicly apologized and pledged to give brands more control over where their ads appear. “This marks a turning point for YouTube. For the first time, it’s dealing not only with reputation damage but revenue damage,” said Alex Krasodomski-Jones, a researcher at the thinktank Demos. YouTube might purport to be a video-sharing service, but as with Google’s search engine and Facebook’s social network, the platform is really about one thing: advertising. “So when there’s a problem with advertising like this, it’s a big problem,” Krasodomski-Jones said. The row highlights an uncomfortable fact about advertising in a digital age: most brands don’t know exactly where their online advertising is running. Black box machines are now largely responsible for the placement of ads online, using complex trading systems that try to get the right message in front of the right person at the right time for the the cheapest possible price. This process is called programmatic advertising. When an ad appears against a piece of content, it’s not always clear whether it’s been shown based on a person’s previous browsing behavior, interests, or demographic data or because the brand is affiliated with a particular content creator, such as a YouTube star. “There has always been good placements of ads and bad placements of ads and media buying companies have always prided themselves on trying to get the context right,” said Charlie Crowe, chairman of the media and marketing publisher C Squared. “The difference in the online world is that it’s all done by an algorithm. The human element is taken out of the equation, so there are problems. “Programmatic advertising has been largely fraudulent since its inception, and there are many companies in the marketplace including Google to have made vast profits out of the naivety of the advertisers, who haven’t really known what they’ve been buying.” The dispute adds weight to demands for companies such as Google to take more responsibility for what is on their websites, as Facebook was forced to do in the wake of the “fake news” scandal. YouTube already provides “brand safety” controls for advertisers, allowing them to pick what types of videos they are happy to be associated with based on keywords. The platform also advises creators about the types of videos not considered “advertiser friendly”, including content that’s sexually suggestive, violent or dealing with a controversial subject matter. However, with 400 hours of video uploaded to the platform each minute, it’s a challenge to keep unpalatable content completely quarantined from paying customers. Fifteen minutes of browsing YouTube by the Guardian was enough to find T-Mobile ads on videos about abortion, Minecraft banners on videos about snorting cocaine and pre-roll ads for Novartis heart medication running on clips titled “Feminism is cancer”. YouTube and Google boycott spreads to US as AT&T and Verizon pull ads Read more “They need to get better at the management of what is brand-safe and what isn’t,” said Gabe Winslow, of the digital marketing agency Ansira. Advertisers and agencies also have a responsibility to audit their campaigns to ensure that their ads appear in the desired location, he said. This squabble is indicative of growing tensions between the advertising industry and technology companies such as Google and Facebook, which have become indispensable partners and, in some cases, competitors. Silicon Valley technology companies completely dominate the online advertising market. According to a 2016 study, Facebook and Google accounted for 90% of the growth in the online advertising industry. All other online media companies are competing for the scraps. The more powerful they become at the expense of traditional media companies, the harder it has become for advertisers to negotiate favourable terms. The current YouTube boycott offers some leverage for demanding better, independently verified data and controls. “There’s increasing resentment among agencies and publishers [towards Google] that’s difficult to talk about given its sheer power,” Crowe said. “This issue has given them a sense of schadenfreude.” Topics Google The Observer YouTube Advertising AT&T Verizon Communications Internet news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Fox & Friends in the henhouse: how Trump's beloved show wields power The president and the Fox News morning show have built a symbiotic relationship: the program defends Trump as it helps set his agenda Published: 26 Mar 2017 Fox & Friends in the henhouse: how Trump's beloved show wields power Fake tube sign read out on BBC News and in Commons after Westminster attack Sign with defiant message for terrorists goes viral and is commended in parliament – but is an online fake Published: 23 Mar 2017 Fake tube sign read out on BBC News and in Commons after Westminster attack 'Disputed by multiple fact-checkers': Facebook rolls out new alert to combat fake news Feature – which flags content as ‘disputed’ – trialled on story that falsely claimed thousands of Irish people were brought to the US as slaves Published: 21 Mar 2017 'Disputed by multiple fact-checkers': Facebook rolls out new alert to combat fake news Google to overhaul advertising policies after growing boycott ‘We deeply apologise,’ says company’s CBO Philipp Schindler as he announces tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content Published: 21 Mar 2017 Google to overhaul advertising policies after growing boycott Google ad controversy: what the row is all about Published: 17 Mar 2017 Google ad controversy: what the row is all about Guardian pulls ads from Google after they were placed next to extremist material Published: 16 Mar 2017 Guardian pulls ads from Google after they were placed next to extremist material Fighting fake news: societies using technology to search for truth Published: 15 Mar 2017 Fighting fake news: societies using technology to search for truth Alternative history: the dangerous byproduct of fake facts Jill Abramson Published: 8 Mar 2017 Alternative history: the dangerous byproduct of fake facts More more on this story most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech selected arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech selected arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Technology › Google back to top tech US world science US politics business Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Obviously, the monstrosity of a volume HUD that Apple continues to impose on iOS users is not something said users like to see, as it gets in the way of everything. Because Google has the right idea, iOS developer midkin decided to create a YouTube-inspired volume HUD system that’s made to work across your whole iOS system. As a result, the new free jailbreak tweak YouTubeVolume was born. After installation, you will see the the changes to the volume HUD you see above any time you press either of your volume buttons, whether you’re in an app or on the Home screen. In apps where you try to watch a video, play a full-screen game, or enjoy other features of the app itself that are normally hindered by the Volume HUD, this tweak offers a large enhancement in accessibility and visual aesthetics. It’s worth noting that YouTubeVolume doesn’t modify the YouTube app in any way shape or form, so you will still experience the YouTube app exactly how Google intended you to experience it. The tweak can be toggled on or off from the preferences pane in the Settings app after installation, and you don’t need to respring to save your changes: Because YouTubeVolume is a free tweak with one simple purpose in mind, it’s not as flashy or feature-rich as some of the other volume HUD replacement tweaks out there, but it gets the job done without putting too much strain on your wallet, which is great for the end user. If you’re interested in trying YouTubeVolume, you can download it completely free of cost from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices.

AshtonNekolah just checked for $1.99 for the same look and the small phone icons which i prefer to live without, ill choose this free one over Sonus anytime. Sebastian Rasch The advantage of Sonus is its configurability. It has tons of settings to adjust the look and the behaviour, for example how wide the bar should be, how thick and how close to the screen border. You can of course deactivate the phone icons as well.

And now, in an exclusive report, the Telegraph has reported that these companies may be prosecuted in Britain if they fail to monitor content being posted online. According to the report, British ministers are looking into passing a law that would allow prosecution of several social media sites, including the Google-owned YouTube among others, if they fail to curb the circulation of extremist content. The Telegraph said that British Prime Minister Theresa May has expressed her displeasure at these internet companies for publishing extremist content. The report quoted her saying that “the ball is in their court” over taking action. “We want to see them take on their responsibility. The problem with the law is in itself we can do what we can but these are global companies,” the Telegraph quoted a source as saying. The report quoted the prime minister’s official spokesman, who said: “The fight against terrorism and hate speech has to be a joint one. The government and security services are doing everything they can and it is clear that social media companies can and must do more. "Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure this material is not disseminated and we have been clear repeatedly that we think that they can and must do more. We are always talking with them on how to achieve that” Joanna Shields, a former Facebook executive, is holding the talks with the tech companies on behalf of the Home Office. The report comes even as Google’s European chief publicly apologized after the ad fiasco. However, due to lack of clarity on whether the company would take strict actions and keep a vigil on the content posted via its platforms, British ministers see this as a matter of grave concern. Last week, the U.K. government removed its advertisements from YouTube after concerns over the ads appearing next to “inappropriate material,” including videos with extremist views, BBC News, which was also affected, had reported.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Android O Offers Awesome Solution To Annoying Persistent Notifications, Brings Notification Badges Too By Zara Ali Mar 23, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google recently released the Android O in the form of a developer preview. After the release, we are gradually coming to know about the new features on it. Among one of the many new changes that have been made with this version, there is a refreshed look for persistent notification. No, it does not mean that annoying persistent notifications are not going to show up. It means that they will still turn up but in a lot more bearable outlook. In Android O, Google has made the appearance of these notifications compact, and their size is minimised to a fulfilling level, and that’s by default. Instead of seeing the notification taking up much space, you will now see a small bar that is half in size of standard notifications. You will also be able to expand these notifications by tapping on the arrow beside the bar. By expanding it, you will be able to read the basic information. Related Android O Developer Preview : New Features And Enhancements That You Must Know Well, among the plethora of new features that tag along with this new version of Android, we found this one to be pretty impressive. Persistent notifications have been bugging our sight for a long time and it is good to see Google finally doing something about it. You can also read about other features of Android O here. Advertisement Android O Brings Notification Badges, Yay! In another news about Android O features, we have got to know that it also boasts iOS-like notification badges. These notification badges are the small numbers that you see on apps like mail and messages that show number of unread messages. Until now this feature was available on iOS devices and it is definitely one hell of a nifty feature. Now, with Android O Google has added native support for notification badges. It is worth noting that other than stock Android, manufacturers like Samsung offered notification badges with their UI on top. One will be able to enable it in the preview build by going to the info panel of the app and turning on the “Show badge.” option. For now, none of the app has the support for it so it remains to be seen how Google is planning to go about it. Maybe, it will provide the full-fledged support in the next update for Android O.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry  ⋮  Security Ajit Pai Hits User Privacy – U.S. Senate Votes to Roll Back FCC’s Privacy Protections By Rafia Shaikh Mar 23, 2017 18Shares Share Tweet Submit "Senate puts ISP profits before user privacy" The US Senate began to debate on Wednesday to repeal regulations adopted by the Obama administration that required internet service providers to protect customers’ privacy. The Senate has today voted “narrowly” to repeal those regulations that demand ISPs to do more to protect user data than tech companies like Google or Facebook. “The vote was along party lines, with 50 Republicans approving the measure and 48 Democrats rejecting it,” Reuters reported. “The two remaining Republicans in the Senate were absent and did not cast a vote.” Related Ajit Pai Calls Net Neutrality a “Mistake” – FCC Chairman Ready to Roll Back Open Net Regulations ISPs have been lobbying to get lawmakers to repeal FCC’s privacy rules The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under then-President Obama had approved rules that required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using their financial, health, or web browsing information, among other data, for advertising and internal marketing. The Senate has now voted to repeal those requirements. The argument supporting this decision is based on the myth that the FCC privacy rules put internet service providers at an unfair disadvantage when compared to companies like Google who can profit off consumer data. However, while so much has been said about tech companies’ access to data, they can never have access to the kind of data that ISPs have, as everything flows through their networks. As Electronic Frontier Foundation had written (emphasis is ours): Google doesn’t see everything you do on the Internet (neither does Facebook, for that matter, or any other online platform)—they only see the traffic you send to them. And you can always choose to use a different website if you want to avoid Google’s tracking. None of that is true about your ISP. You probably only have one, maybe two options when it comes to ISPs offering high-speed Internet, and your ISP sees everything – they have to, in order to send your traffic to the right place. That’s why we need the FCC’s privacy rules: ISPs are in a position of power, and they’ve shown they’re willing to abuse that power. Today’s vote comes as a huge victory for internet providers such as AT&T and Verizon Communications who had strongly opposed FCC’s privacy rules and have since lobbied to repeal them. However, it doesn’t come as a surprise since the new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has remained outspoken against these rules since the beginning. Related White House Chief Digital Officer Removed After Failing to Pass FBI’s Background Check Advertisement Reuters reported that the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the “Senate was overturning a regulation that ‘makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment'”. In the opposition, Democratic Senator Ed Markey added that the “Republicans have just made it easier for American’s sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared, and sold to the highest bidder without their permission”. “Senate votes to sacrifice privacy of Americans in the interest of protecting the profits of internet companies” Neema Singh Guliani, ACLU Legislative Counsel, said the Senate’s vote sacrifices “privacy rights of Americans in the interest of protecting the profits of major internet companies, including Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon”. “The resolution would undo privacy rules that ensure consumers control how their most sensitive information is used,” Guliani added. “The House must now stop this resolution from moving forward and stand up for our privacy rights.” The bill will now go to the US House of Representatives, but it’s unlikely that it would be stopped there. Once it gets the expected number of votes there, the legislation would then require President Trump’s signature. Jeremy Gillula of EFF said, “We are one step closer to a world where ISPs can snoop on our traffic, sell our private information to the highest bidder, and pre-install spyware on our mobile phones”.

Google actually released Hangouts back in 2013 as a more feature-filled chat service to take the place of Talk in the Gmail sidebar, but users have been able to stick with the older, more basic service if they chose, The Verge reports. That’s changing on June 26, when anyone still using Gchat will be forcibly transitioned over to Hangouts. It’s not a major change for most — there will still be chat built into Gmail, contacts will transition over, and Google has been trying to get people to switch over to Hangouts for the last four years, so maybe it’s time for Talk to go. The Google Talk Android app will also stop functioning, as will any third-party apps designed for Talk. (Again, anything using Hangouts — which is essentially the same thing — will still be fine.) Google has at least seven other messaging services that you can use, including Allo, Duo, Hangouts, Android Messages, Voice, and Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger, so you’ve got plenty of other options to use going forward. Google also confirmed that it will be removing SMS support from Hangouts (as previously rumored), and encouraging Android users to switch over to the newly renamed Android Messages app. It’s a move that speaks both to Google’s increasing push for RCS messaging, as well as the company’s ambitions to reposition Hangouts into a viable business messaging tool to take on competitors like Slack.

While Google already has the chat app Allo and video calling app Duo, it may be feeling pressure from its competitors' similar offerings. Facebook has a similar social photo sharing app called Moments, for example, while Apple just announced its AI-powered movie editing app, Clips, Engadget says. In an email, a Google spokesperson told Engadget that this is an experiment -- just one of many that the company runs at any given time and that there are currently no plans to launch. According to TechCrunch, the new app will allow a group of friends to edit photos together and then organize them to look at later. This potential app sounds a lot like Moments with added editing features, as users will be able to create groups to share and edit their photos collaboratively. TechCrunch's sources believe that the app would also bring Google's image search ability, which would let you identify objects in photos for future searches within the app. Google seems to be trying the "throw everything at the wall and see what sticks" approach to its social media strategy, Engadget says.

Levinson. Calico is derived from the acronym for ‘California Life Company’. As of 2015, Google announced restructuring into Alphabet; making Google and Calico its subsidiaries, amongst others. C4 Therapeutics develops drugs based on Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD). Their focus is to target the difficult diseases and develop different therapies for serious conditions. C4 Therapeutics, on March 23; announced a five-year partnership with Calico on its official website. This collaboration is mainly to discover and develop along with commercializing the new therapies; that are helpful in treating diseases related to aging, as well as cancer. The companies are not aiming for a life-saving elixir, but for developing drugs to prevent the diseases. Collaboration of Two Major Biotechs – Google Calico and C4T Given the fact that Google Calico is stealthy in nature; it has maintained that it will not disclose the financial and detailed deals and targets of the collaboration. Previously, the San Francisco biotech company has signed deals relevant to various life sciences with many companies and institutes. Calico’s deal with California’s QB3 explores the science behind age-related diseases and longevity. It has also collaborated with academic institutions like MIT’s Broad Institute, University of California/San Francisco, and Harvard for research at the discovery stage; and with companies like 2M, the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and AbbVie. These two life sciences companies will notably collaborate to discover and develop the protein degraders as therapeutic agents. Basically, this partnership is a combination of Calico’s expertise over the years; and C4 Therapeutics advancement in biochemistry, pharmacology, and chemistry, etc. Google Calico will head the responsibility of the clinical development of medicines developed and its commercialization. While the responsibility of discovery and research will be on the shoulders of C4 Therapeutics. Development of New Therapeutics The research will be carried out at the labs of both the biotechs; at Calico’s CA labs in San Francisco, and at C4T’s labs in Cambridge, MA. A fleet of scientist ranging from fields like drug development, molecular biology, system biology, and medicine; to the fields of computational biology, DNA and genetic research will work on the same. Cancer and researches related to this disease have remained a fervent topic for a very long time now. Many life sciences, pharmacy companies, and system biology researchers have explored the vast horizons of Cancer. The partnership of Calico and C4T will not only develop therapeutics for Cancer; but also for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s amongst other age-related diseases. With the World Cancer Day held just last month and every year on February 4; the news of this collaboration is another significant hope for the advancement in research involving Cancer and other age-related horrendous diseases. New Rays of Hope The President and Chief Scientific Officer of C4T, Andrew Phillips; mentioned that they are thrilled to partner with Calico to pioneer novel therapeutics. Additionally, Hal Barron, the President of Research and Development at Calico; expressed that it is a challenge to find the effective pharmacologic inhibitors for the biologically well-validated targets in cancer as well as other diseases. He added that the alternative strategy which specifically targets degradation proteins; will give the opportunity of identifying and developing new therapeutics. Calico and C4T will jointly pursue the pre-clinical experiments for small molecules of protein degraders. They have a sky soaring goal to achieve, and we believe that their expertise and clinical assistance will help them do so over the years.

Some of the presentations are highly recommended to watch not only to GDs and BPMs, but also to game producers. Most of the presentations are free to access, including both slides and video, but several of them have limited access and only slides to this presentations are available for free. But even in this case, they may contain some important information about the industry or particular games, so it worth to check them. The text in the Limited Access section is description taken from the GDC vault website,  as, unfortunately, I don`t have access to it, but selected several ones that may be interesting including their slides, while the one that is under the “Comment” Free access section is my own mini-review of the presentation to let you some quick understanding what awaits you in particular talk from a third party POV.  List of presentations Free access 1.    The Year in F2P Games, Part One: Social/Mobile 2.    The Year in F2P Games, Part Two: Beyond Social/Mobile 3.    Your Freemium Mobile App is Leaving Money on the Table.

It also provides several numbers (day and number of IAP purchases and their relation to LTV of a user) that sounds intriguing and worth to be at least checked in games.   Social Impact in Design and Acquisition http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022255/Social-Impact-in-Design-and Comment: Very interesting and recommended presentations about why social elements in games matter and how users may influence other user to pay.   Power-ups, Super Suits, and Epic Raids: Deconstructing the Game Experience (Presented by Limelight Networks) http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022213/Power-ups-Super-Suits-and Comment: The presentation does not talk about F2P games, more about games in general and what game experience may make a game successful. No deep insights, but nice to watch as some decisions and solutions that speaker talks about may be applicable in mobile games as well.   Player Centric Live Ops Monetization (Presented by Fuse Powered Inc) http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022202/Player-Centric-Live-Ops-Monetization Comment: Nice presentation that builds solid framework of BPM Live Ops ways to sell content. Highly recommend to watch to beginners in the field, not only to the beginner BPMs but designers as well. The talk covers both IAP and advertising solutions (like incentivized videos) and ways they can be placed in the game. It does not cover any deep and sophisticated solutions, but nevertheless gives some very trustworthy basis on which principles one may build its monetization strategy.   Meaningful Pay: Monetizing F2P Without "The Pinch" http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022151/Meaningful-Pay-Monetizing-F2P-Without Comment: Psychology-backed presentation which describes ways to built F2P monetization without abusing user experience by “squeezing” from them the very last dollars, but rather enhancing this experience. It's recommended to watch to everyone who deals with monetization, to designers - to try to find ways to create ways to monetize a game in more soft and player-centric ways, and to BPMs to try to design more suitable to users` needs offers.   In It for the Long Hall: How Wooga Boosts Long-Term Retention http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022070/In-It-for-the-Long Comment: Very nice presentation from Wooga, built around Long Term retention as main revenue-generating success factor. It's divided into two parts - the first one about game design features that are crucial to built long-lasting game involvement from a player side, the second one - is about narrative writing challenges and how they may be resolved. Almost nothing is being said about monetization, except of several numbers regarding different user cohorts spending behavior (influence of social pressure). Recommended to be watched by the beginners in game design and monetization fields.   Idle Games: The Mechanics and Monetization of Self-Playing Games http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022065/Idle-Games-The-Mechanics-and Comment: Deconstruction of “idle games” as a genre, from a company that actually is one of the pioneers in it - Kongregate. The presentation covers topics from game design to monetization. Must see to everyone who is interested in idle games, and recommended to watch to ones who would like to use some idle games mechanics in other genres (actually, some solutions indeed may be and should be used).   Games-as-a-Service: Rebooting a 4-Year-Old Game to the Top Charts http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022006/Games-as-a-Service-Rebooting Comment: Is it possible to revive a 4-year old game? According to this presentation - yes. It almost does not cover design and monetization, just some small remarks, and thus designers and BPMs may not be very interested to watch it. Maybe producers, GMs and other decision-makers may try to use some tips from the presentation in their projects, but nothing deep and sophisticated solutions were presented.   Epic Fail Microtalks: Four Mobile Games, Four Flops and Tons of Lessons Learned http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021960/Epic-Fail-Microtalks-Four-Mobile Comment: A story how decisions make lead to a game failure. Almost no mentions about design and monetization, may be interesting more to a decision-makers.   Crossy Road: A Whale of a Time http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021897/Crossy-Road-A-Whale-of Comment: Success story of a Crossy Road. The presentation reveals numbers and way that was passed to create such phenomenon. Though presentation does not reveal nothing extraordinary (except real revenue numbers of the game) it may be a clear example that there is a room for innovative decisions on the market. The presentation may be interested to anyone who involved in video games creation as some motivation video, but it's not a manual to “create-the-next-hit”.   Clash of Clans: Designing Games That People Will Play For Years http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021858/Clash-of-Clans-Designing-Games Comment: The talk about vision and values that has team of CoC developers. If you are looking for some design and monetization insights - it`s not the right place. The only astonishing number that was revealed in this video - 2 year retention of the game is 10%.   3 Monetization Metrics to Track Every Single Day (Presented by Chartboost) http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021748/3-Monetization-Metrics-to-Track Comment: Basic overview of engagement, retention and CSR. May be interesting to very beginners in the field only.   9 Mobile Game Monetization Questions to Gain a Competitive Edge (And the Answers Too!) (Presented by Chartboost) http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021751/9-Mobile-Game-Monetization-Questions Comment: Marketing-driven presentation, but gives some interesting data about UA costs, users` purchasing behavior, geographical preferences and money distribution.   Smart Strategies to Acquire, Monetize and Retain Gamers (Presented by Google) http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022494/Smart-Strategies-to-Acquire-Monetize Comment: Marketing presentation of Google mobile ads/analytics solutions for mobile apps.   Overcoming Analysis Paralysis: Experimenting with Bears vs. Art http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022184/Overcoming-Analysis-Paralysis-Experimenting-with Comment: Great presentation about experimenting with a soft-launched game to reach target KPIs. It has data, description of added and changed features, and nice advices to other developers how to treat games. Though, of course, many of them are project-specific and cannot be applied directly, but it`s recommended to all who involved in games creation.   More Science Behind Shaping Player Behavior in Online Games http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player Comment: Though the presentation is very specific, about players who use abusive language and are “toxic” in online games that have social interactions, it`s very interesting to listen how their behavior may be shaped to decrease their negative influence on “positive” players. It may be especially interesting to those who involved in projects where social interactions are crucial and intense.   Metagame Balance http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022155/Metagame Comment: Balance is a cornerstone of any game and it`s almost always a problem how to come up with the right solution. The speaker presents a way which may be used to analyze balance of a characters in a fighting game and it's very theme-specific. But even in this case designers may benefit from this talk as it seems that method described may be applicable in various game genres.   Why Did Players Buy That? The Importance of Anticipated Need Satisfaction http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022369/Why-Did-Players-Buy-That Comment: Another great presentation from Immersive and Scott Rigby, backed by psychology. While it does not talk about game design directly, especially about F2P, it touches important topic of what can drive a user to purchase a certain game and this approach may and should be used in creating marketing assets, as well as it may be applicable to game creation. Highly recommended to watch by designers, BPMs, and marketing specialists.   Thinking About People: Designing Games for Social Simulation http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022334/Thinking-About-People-Designing-Games Comment: Very specific talk, though interesting. Social elements usually give strong positive advantage to F2P games and, in most cases, are necessary for success. The game does not talk about F2P, mostly about PC projects, but framework that the speaker presents (autonomous social simulations vs. tailored) may be adapted to F2P projects as well. The presentation may be interested mainly for designers and game creation enthusiasts.   Spellbound: Asking Questions About Habit Forming Game Design http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022259/Spellbound-Asking-Questions-About-Habit Comment: Very abstract talk, with no real games examples. Sometimes F2P games are being accused of creating addictions or harming users by creating habits that consume time and money and this presentation is aimed on overview of all these statements and countering with them. It's unlikely to give you some design or monetization advices, but more likely gives some kind of better and deep understanding of F2P games philosophy.   LIMITED ACCESS   Awesome Video Game Data (2015) Slides: http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021828/Awesome-Video-Game-Data EEDAR co-founder Geoffrey Zatkin presents a tour de force romp through video game industry data, patterns and trends, covering everything from next generation consoles to the maturation of mobile games to the diversification of monetization methodologies and everything in-between.

This talk aims to dispel the myth that you need a mega-hit to create a meaningful business, instead showing a path to success built around caring for a small, dedicated group of fans who want to belong to something special.   Five Things You Can Do Today to Be a Bit More Agile Slides: http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021983/Five-Things-You-Can-Do We all want to be more agile. We want a process that helps us deliver an awesome game without getting in our way, but need to drag the rest of IT and the business along with us.

We have five ways to be more agile without officially changing your process, or getting forced to respawn.   Effective LiveOps Strategies Slides: http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021948/Effective-LiveOps The benefits of operating a free-to-play "game-as-a-service" are well known: elastic pricing, a direct relationship with your players, longer lifespan, and an opportunity to fine-tune after launch. But to fully realize these benefits, you need to plan your live operations strategy as carefully as you plan your game. This talk will cover two important aspects of LiveOps: in-game events and player offers. You'll learn why they matter, when to use them, how to design and plan them, and how to use analytics to tune and tweak them.   Don't Be Afraid of Incentivized Ads!

Where has this been on mobile? Mobile players have an equal desire to create and share, but up to this point can mostly satisfy it only through passive activities like sharing and rating screenshots, asynchronous multiplayer PvP, and rigid base design. Pocket Gems' newest product, Episode, has opened all of its creation tools to the public, inviting players to create interactive animated stories and share them with the community. This talk will cover some of the mistakes we made along the way, tools and techniques we've developed, lessons we've learned, and how to apply these to the mobile industry as a whole.   LiveOps: A Process in the Making Slides: http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022126/LiveOps-A-Process-in-the "Games as a Service" and LiveOps continue to grow as buzzwords in the industry. But what they actually mean for developers still remains vague and how to successfully pull them off with a small staff seems unreal. Working as a team, small studies can be successful in Live Operations using a process that encourages flexibility and quick changes with minimal impact on the project's longer-term goals. This talk provides insight and advice on how to become a small LiveOps-first studio using analytics, player behavior and studio process to create a high-quality player experience.   World of Tanks Blitz Postmortem: Building a AAA MMO for Mobile Devices Slides: http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022376/World-of-Tanks-Blitz-Postmortem This session will describe the decisions made during the development of World of Tanks Blitz.

The email mentioned that Hangouts users using carrier SMS would be promted to switch to an alternative messaging app. Now, Google has officially detailed this move in a new G Suite blog post, while also announcing some other changes to streamline Hangouts and Gmail. The blog post reaffirms Google's desire to revamp Hangouts to serve G Suite and enterprise users. The company earlier this month rolled Hangouts Meet video conferencing service along with text-based messaging service Hangout Chat. The new services aim to serve business and group chat users alike. "We've been working hard to streamline the classic Hangouts product for enterprise users, and, as part of this effort, will be removing carrier SMS functionality in the classic Hangouts app for Android, starting on May 22," reads the blog post. Google also confirms that SMS functionality will now move to Android Messages. In an effort to reduce the wide and confusing number of messaging apps, Google has also decided to move the old Google Talk, or GChat, over to Hangouts after June 26. This means that anyone who was still using Google Talk rather than Hangouts will now need to shift to Hangouts to continue messaging on Gmail. Furthermore, the Google Talk app for Android will also stop functioning. Despite stopping its services for Google Talk, the company still has an array of messaging services to offer including Allo, Duo, Hangouts and Android Messages. But it now looks like Google wants to clearly define each of its messaging apps to serve different purposes. It also wants to push its Allo chat app and Duo video calling app as the the ones general users should choose over Hangouts. Additionally, Google will also be retiring several Gmail Labs projects including Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews on or after April 24, 2017. Meanwhile, two Google+ features in Gmail will also bid farewell: the ability to email Google+ profiles and the use of Google+ Circles.

According to the post that went up on Google's Security Blog, the company outlines that since 2012, it has warned users when their accounts were suspected of state-sponsored attacks. A year ago, in an effort to make these things even clearer for the user, the firm changed how notifications were delivered, doing away with a small warning banner that could have gone unnoticed. While a majority of users will never see such a warning, Google is again putting the spotlight on these types of attacks, but also explains: The notice does not necessarily mean that the account has been compromised or that there is a widespread attack. Rather, the notice reflects our assessment that a government-backed attacker has likely attempted to access the user’s account or computer through phishing or malware. Naturally, Google urges users to get a Security Checkup to make sure that everything is secure and to also enable two-factor authentication, which a lot of its services support.

Not likely Assistants will end up specialized  (SAN JOSE) MERCURY NEWS Published on March 25, 2017 Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print SAN JOSE, Calif. — It’s no wonder titans of tech are locked in an epic battle of the bots, racing furiously to produce the best virtual assistant. Their respective help-bots — Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana — promise consumers one of the most valuable commodities in the world: free time. Amazon’s Alexa help-bot on the Echo Dot and Tap competes with Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Thanks to the sudden acceleration of artificial intelligence and advancements in speech recognition and big-data storage, the technology behind virtual assistants is rapidly spreading from phones to cars and homes, and the truly useful helper is approaching fast. The four giants are fighting for the biggest share of a market expected to grow to $12 billion by 2024. “There’s a tremendous amount of promise for these agents to help and assist with many different tasks that we face every day,” said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. “The more the agent can help you with, the more value it holds.” Today, the aid these virtual assistants provide remains limited. Most users of Google Home and Amazon Echo devices — which host Assistant and Alexa, respectively — stream music, play audio books, and control smart-home devices, according to surveys by San Francisco analytics firm VoiceLabs. Still, the virtual agent’s foundation in AI means the more it learns about a user’s preferences and behaviors, the better job it can do. So while experts predict a handful of firms will dominate in this field, they’re split on whether consumers will be served best by one bot, or more. “People want one assistant, they don’t want two,” said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research in San Jose. “You want one assistant, to be very readily available wherever you are.” However, the various assistants likely will end up somewhat specialized in their expertise, with Google’s Assistant, for example, excelling in providing knowledge and managing schedules, and Microsoft’s Cortana leading on gaming, said VoiceLabs CEO Adam Marchick. In a few years, many people will use two or three different assistants, he predicted. The industry stands at a critical moment, because the first highly effective help-bot to get a foothold in a consumer’s home, phone, or car likely will stay, creating a barrier to competitors, Mr. Marchick said. For a virtual helpmate to run your life, it needs to engage with the providers of all the services you rely on, from your calendar app to your Uber ride. Those providers must either partner with the company operating the assistant, or design their app to integrate with the assistant. So Spotify will stream music upon request via Alexa, and Honeywell’s smart-home thermostat, via Assistant, will bump up the temperature 15 minutes before Grandma’s expected arrival. For providers, “if there is a competitive advantage to be gained, then absolutely they will do it,” said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at market research firm Parks Associates. For all the major players, virtual assistants provide important data that fuel the AI that powers and improves them, making both the assistants and the products they live in ever more marketable. For Amazon, Alexa is an enthusiastic purchasing agent for the e-commerce that drives the firm. For Google, Assistant is a turbocharged vacuum for the data the company collects to sell ads targeted directly at users. So far, Google and Amazon have focused largely on home-based assistants. Google’s new Pixel phones host Assistant, but it has an uphill battle because Apple has far more phones equipped with Siri on the market, said Tim Bajarin of the San Jose market research firm Creative Strategies. While building the supreme help-bot is clearly a priority for many firms, experts say the software today lacks the knowledge base to take the next big leap: to enable virtual assistants that can predict our needs to serve us better.

Ninety percent of Provo households are connected to the internet. Since 2015, the "digital divide," or number of households without internet access, has been reduced by 50 percent, the company said Thursday in a "community impact report." Google Fiber bought the Provo's high-speed fiber-optic network in 2013. At the time, it was only the third U.S. city where the internet giant built or bought a fiber system to deliver high-speed internet. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Now, Google Fiber is building a fiber network in Salt Lake City to provide web access and optional television and phone services. Part of the network is already operating in the city center. The company also said it is providing free service to 25 public buildings, such as libraries and schools, plus 147 families in low-income housing. In addition, it is supporting digital literacy and science, technology and math education programs in schools. Alliance: Utah could add jobs with Trump's pro-development policies The Western Energy Alliance contends Utah could add 1,027 jobs to its economy if pro-development policies of the Trump Administration increase oil and gas production by 25 percent. That would boost oil-and-gas jobs to more than 13,600 and nearly 200,000 nationwide. The alliance, a nonprofit trade association representing more than 300 companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production in the West, urged the U.S. Senate to repeal the Bureau of Land Management's rule on venting and flaring and said it is seeking "regulatory certainty that balances environmental protection." Kris Rudarmel second runner-up in restoration industry contest South Jordan businesswoman Kris Rudarmel, co-owner of a family business called Anchor Water Damage and Restoration, was second runner-up recently in a contest honoring women in the restoration industry. She and her husband, Frank, run the business, which has received seven awards from Remediation and Restoration magazine in the last eight years. "Women bring a new way of doing things to the table," Rudarmel said, "a sort of quiet strength and the ability to help build others up and bring out the best in everyone around them."

An anti-Semitic clip claiming the existence of a "Jewish World Order" was featured alongside advertisements in Germany from insurer AXA, oil company Total in France, Range Rover vehicles in South Africa, footwear retailer Skopunkten and website Tradera in Sweden, Bloomberg searches of YouTube from each country found on Thursday. The video was also paired with brands in Asia — Castrol lubricants in India and Cow & Gate infant formula in Hong Kong. VIDEOS TOP JOBS A separate sermon by preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril, who according to U.S. prosecutors once took credit for a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, can be viewed alongside advertisements from Nissan in Sweden and wireless carrier MTN Group in South Africa. Meanwhile, the Islamophobic English Defence League gathers support from advertisers Total, Netflix, IBM and watchmaker Tag Heuer International in France. The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding across the globe at a pace Alphabet's Google has struggled to match in its response. On Thursday, as Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said Google could "get pretty close" to guaranteeing companies' ads won't be placed near hateful material, advertisers throughout Europe were confronting more than a dozen new examples and scrambling to protect their brands. "We didn't know that our ads were played in this context," Axa spokeswoman Anja Kroll said in an email. "We have immediately arranged for an update of the filters and stopped the delivery" of ads with these videos because "diversity, tolerance and openness are values that are of key importance for us and that we practice daily." While Axa hasn't pulled its ads from YouTube, the German unit is using "blacklist" filters to prevent its ads from appearing next to extremist, racist or other undesired content, Kroll said. In this case, she said, the filters apparently failed. "We don't comment on individual videos but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear," a Google spokesperson said. "We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands." Range Rover said in an email it was suspending its YouTube campaign in South Africa while it investigates. Telenor Sweden, which had an ad showing before a propaganda video from a Swedish neo-Nazi group, also halted all YouTube advertising, according to Aron Samuelsson, a spokesman. Nissan said it was "urgently reviewing" with Google while Nilson Group, owner of Skopunkten, said it had asked its media agency about the ads and is "awaiting answers," according to Linda Fernell, a spokeswoman. Total, IBM, MTN, Tag Heuer, Netflix, Castrol India and Cow&Gate owner Danone didn't respond or had no immediate comment. Tradera's owner, Paypal, declined to comment. In Sweden, an Ikea spot was found alongside a homophobic and anti-Semitic video entitled: "Gay Pride Parade a Tool of International Jews," while another clip in India tied the so-called gay agenda to "Satanic Illuminati" and touted the F3 Plus smartphone from China's Oppo. An ad for HBO's "The Young Pope" found its way to the pre-roll for "Jewish Hypocrisy -- Flooding Europe With Immigrants" in Spain. "It is completely unacceptable that IKEA appears in a context like this," spokeswoman Cecilia Nettelbladt Stenberg said by phone. "What we've done now is to ask our media agency to immediately investigate the reason behind this." "We don't control the YouTube ad placement, but we greatly oppose it," HBO said in an email. "We will be taking steps to get it removed." Oppo didn't respond. The advertisers' discomfort highlights the reliance of Google and Facebook on automated software that maximizes volume to help them dominate online advertising. Digital advertising grew by 17 percent globally to $178 billion in 2016, according to marketing consultant Magna Global, which projects that digital-based ad sales will overtake TV to become the No. 1 media category this year. The global array of companies caught up in the controversy illustrates the scale of the problem for Google, which risks potential financial and reputational damage. The company was already facing claims in a lawsuit by the family of a terror attack victim that it profits from ads linked to terrorist propaganda promoting violence. The latest crisis erupted after a Times of London investigation last week revealed ads running alongside offensive content. Alphabet's market value has dropped by about $24 billion this week. "A cascade of major brand boycotts for Google ad spend (mostly non-search) has emerged, raising concerns on first quarter and second quarter results and the future of programmatic advertising," Justin Post, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note on Thursday, referencing the automated software Google uses to match advertisers with content online. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Ford Motor Co. suspended their YouTube ads on Thursday. AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline and Verizon Communications joined the boycott earlier this week, after British Broadcasting Corp., Sainsbury, Volkswagen and Toyota Motor Corp. said they had pulled ads in the U.K. » Next page...

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | March 21, 2017 -- 17:56 GMT (10:56 PDT) | Topic: Security "Free and fair elections depend on people having access to the information they need, and around the world the sources of that information are increasingly under attack," said Google France and Jigsaw. (Image: Project Shield Google) Weeks ahead of the national elections in France, Google and its sister company Jigsaw are helping news sites, NGOs, and other entities involved in the elections process protect themselves against digital threats. The two companies have packaged a suite of "Protect Your Election" tools, which includes two-step verification and the Password Alert Chrome extension. It also includes access to Project Shield, a layer of defense against DDOS attacks. "Free and fair elections depend on people having access to the information they need, and around the world the sources of that information are increasingly under attack," said Anne-Gabrielle Dauba-Pantanacce of Google France and Jigsaw's Jamie Albers in a blog post. While these tools aren't exactly new, tech giants like Google are under growing pressure to respond to cybersecurity threats against democratic institutions. A NATO official recently warned that cyber attacks pose a threat to democracy around the globe, while Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, is pressing Facebook and Google to do more about the spread of misinformation. Meanwhile, Microsoft executive Brad Smith has called on tech companies to serve as a "digital Switzerland" to assist and protect customers of any national origin against cyber attacks. Google and Jigsaw noted that Holland's leading election information site went offline just hours before this year's election due to a DDOS attack. Now, the Dutch site is using Shield and has stayed online through continued attacks. VIDEO: Were voting machines hacked during the 2016 election?

Tech Culture by Joan E. Solsman March 21, 2017 10:30 AM PDT @joan_e Virtual reality is pulling music videos back on stage for another encore -- if you can even call them "videos." VR, which puts headset wearers in a digital world, was the buzziest technology topic at this year's SXSW Conference and Festivals in Austin, Texas, based on the 1.5 million #SXSW tweets from the middle of last week through the festivals' close on Sunday. Fittingly for a fest with roots as a music blowout, music-based VR was the drumbeat underneath this year's event. Whether through straightforward experiences that animated specific songs, or interactions that nudged tunes into gaming, SXSW gave music-driven VR a chance to cut through the noise. Music is the latest trend to cycle through the emerging world of virtual reality, as artists, filmmakers, animators and others have experimented with the new medium over the last three years. Now VR holds promise to evolve music videos into something deeper. "A piece of music can define a moment in your life, and hearing it again years later can transport you back to that moment," said Chris Milk, the founder and CEO of virtual-reality company Within, who has directed videos for artists like Kanye West and Arcade Fire. Milk said he has spent most of his career trying to evoke that same depth of feeling, but he never felt he found it until he started creating in virtual reality. "It's the closest thing to raw music I've ever found," Milk said. "Music and VR together will redefine what we understand a music video to be."

Music could help with one of the key challenges facing VR: quality content. Last year saw Sony, HTC, Samsung, Google and the Facebook-owned Oculus pour resources into launching hardware, but investments for VR media were much more limited. Premium VR content, especially compared to gaming, is harder to make and to fund, and it's tricky for consumers to find. That's where music comes in. It checks off a lot of boxes crucial for VR to grow and reach consumers, according to Rob Ruffler, a senior director of Viacom Next, which showed off two music-based experiences at SXSW. Experimentation is key to the technology at this early stage, he said, and music provides a short-duration format that doesn't require creators to deliver a logical story, or even use words. Music provides a prime testing ground for artists to take risks with VR and reach a wider audience. "It's fair to say that interest in music in VR has grown in the past year," Ruffler said. Viacom has some pedigree in music videos: It's the company behind MTV, ground zero for the format when the channel launched 35 years ago. As music videos faded from the forefront of MTV and other "music" networks in favor of reality programming, the genre shifted onto online platforms like YouTube. Of the five all-time most-watched videos there that have surpassed 2 billion views, all but one are music videos. Now VR may be music videos' third act. The headliners of SXSW 2017 Virtual reality has been a growing presence at SXSW since Oculus began showing up here in 2013. This year, the festival inaugurated a "virtual cinema," a dimly lit meeting hall in downtown Austin's JW Marriott. Appropriately for VR, it was one of the few SXSW conference locales that fooled you into forgetting you were in a garden-variety hotel conference room or the middle of a convention center. Enlarge Image SXSW launched a "virtual cinema" hall this year, with 38 experiences. Joan E. Solsman/CNET The virtual cinema offered 38 experiences for badge-holders to try, with all types of virtual reality represented, but music-based VR stood out. "Show It 2 Me" is one of the first VR experiences to take Google's Tilt Brush, a popular VR painting program, and hack it into an animating tool. Chris Prynoski, owner of the studio Titmouse, which made the video, was an artist in residence at Google and said he nudged the company to develop the capabilities. Tilt Brush's static VR sculptures have turned into experiences that can move through time. The result is a trippy car ride through neon skulls and palm trees that flick into giant daggers, using audio-reactive brushes that pulse to the beat of Night Club's song. Tilt Brush, coincidentally, won SXSW Interactive's award for virtual and augmented reality. The tools used for "Show It 2 Me" are part of Tilt Brush Toolkit, an open-source library already available for the program. Milk's Within showed off a work-in-progress music video at the festival called "Vibrant Matter," which is one of the earliest nongaming VR experiences to experiment with interactivity on phone-powered headsets. It ran on a Google Daydream device and took advantage of the touchpad on its remote to let the viewer turn the landscape into jagged wave patterns at will. Experiments with interactivity melded other music experiences into something participatory. The most clearly gamelike was "Playthings VR: Karaoke Cruise," another work in progress that riffs on a Rock Band-style rhythm game. It builds on an existing VR experience called "Playthings: VR Music Vacation," which creates a fantasy realm of junk food transformed into interactive musical instruments to play. "Karaoke Cruise" dives into the parts of "Music Vacation" users liked the best, according to creator George Michael Brower, linked to a "Secret Rhythm Game Mode" in the current release. In the demo of "Karaoke Cruise," two Touch controllers for the Oculus Rift morph into drumsticks. You sync your drumbeats to the rhythm of the music to score, but instead of hitting snares and reaching for high hats, you drum on oversize jelly beans, gummy bears and doughnuts flying toward you. But others melded music and interactivity to experiment with something that wasn't quite gaming. "The Melody of Dust" lets users explore a virtual room where they can mix sounds to create one of 87 unique songs. The Melody of Dust "The Melody of Dust" -- created by Viacom Next and Nick Koenig, better known by his stage name Hot Sugar -- gives users the freedom to create combinations of sounds to score their experience. In it, you move between a spinning fountain and a room filled with objects. Each object -- a bird, a rose, a bottle of champagne -- has a sound associated with it. When you throw them into the fountain, you create a unique melody that plays at the end of the experience. It has 87 different combinations that become songs, and Koenig plans to release 13 of the combinations as an album of songs at the end of the month. Another was "Chocolate," the second VR music video by Tyler Hurd, who created last year's "Old Friend." While "Old Friend" drew praise for deftly re-creating the feeling of joy from dancing like a total idiot without caring how you looked, "Chocolate" was Hurd's experiment with more interactivity in music VR, he said. The experience turns you into a chrome robot whose hands can blast out psychedelic floating cats as ritualistic dancers and other cats pop champagne bottles and gyrate to the Giraffage song for which the video is named. Both were presented by Viacom Next. And for both "Chocolate" and "The Melody of Dust," there's no scoring or mission. In what's probably the best litmus test of an interactive experience, you don't want to play these "games" just once.

Ministers are considering a new law which would mean Google – which owns YouTube - and other social media sites like Facebook and Twitter can be prosecuted if they allow such videos to be disseminated. Theresa May, the Prime Minister, made clear her displeasure at internet companies that publish extremist content on Friday, saying "the ball is in their court” over taking action. Google publicly apologised this week after the growing scandal over extremist videos on YouTube led to a series of companies pulling their adverts from the internet giant. Google, which owns the video sharing website YouTube, and other social media sites have an agreement to take down extremist content within 24 hours when they are alerted to it. But ministers are worried that this still allows the videos to be viewed thousands of times before they are taken down. However ministers in the Home Office are now looking at a new law to force the websites to take down content immediately or face court action. Officials are trying to work out how the law can be enforced in the UK given that many films that can be seen in the UK are hosted on foreign websites. One source said: "We want to see them take on their responsibility. The problem with the law is in itself we can do what we can but these are global companies.” The Home Office’s talks with the internet companies are being led by Baroness Shields, who as Joanna Shields was a former Facebook executive. The news came as Mrs May’s spokesman said that "social media companies can and must do more”. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: "The fight against terrorism and hate speech has to be a joint one. The government and security services are doing everything they can and it is clear that social media companies can and must do more. "Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure this material is not disseminated and we have been clear repeatedly that we think that they can and must do more. We are always talking with them on how to achieve that "The ball is now in their court. We will see how they respond.” Currently websites are deemed not to have liability for content as long as they take remove it swiftly when given notice. A recent survey in Germany found that Google took down 90 per cent of extremist sites within 24 hours of being notified. Google sources stressed the company had a good record at taking down extremist content, adding that 98 per cent of flagged videos are reviewed within 24 hours. One said: "We move content swiftly when it is drawn to our attention.” Earlier this week MPs suggested that Google risked breaking anti-terrorism laws by allegedly failing to remove illegal recruitment videos posted by banned far-Right group National Action from YouTube. Robert Buckland, the Solicitor-General, said that Google could be breaking the law if it is found to have been "reckless" in allowing the material to remain online. Under the Terrorism Act 2006 it is an offence to disseminate terrorist material either "intentionally" or "recklessly". Google was also accused of "profiting from hatred” following concerns that adverts were appearing alongside extremist material on its YouTube platform. Marks & Spencer became the latest company to withdraw its adverts from Google, following in the footsteps of the likes of McDonald’s, L’Oreal and the BBC. بازگشت به بالای صفحه 0 .به کانال تلگرام ما بپیوندید روی خط سایت ها سوپرمارکت آنلاین مصرف دارچین به سلامت دستگاه گوارش کمک می کند یه پیشنهاد فوق العاده رزرو آنلاین هتل مدیا ویدیوی شیوه عجیب پاسخگویی وزیر راه در فرودگاه / ویدیوی تکنیک جالب گران فروشی طلافروشان / ویدیوی حرف های مهناز افشار درباره... آیا تازه صدای خرد شدن استخوان های محرومان را شنیده‌اید؟/ گلایه جواد خیابانی از اشتباه‌پنداری برخی مخاطبان/... ترامپ؛ به ظرافت احمدی‌نژاد / آیت‌الله مکارم شیرازی: تخطی از رعایت قوانین راهنمایی و رانندگی گناه است پاسخ به شایعاتی درباره استخر محل فوت آیت‌الله هاشمی/ تاثیر تصادفات جاده‌ای بر عمل پیوند عضو در ایران/... نظر شما نام: ایمیل: * نظر: آخرین اخبار انهدام باند سارقان خودرو در کرج تأثیرگذارترین دانشمندان زن جهان روزنما: نمایی از دیوار کنونی پلاسکو روحانی مسکو را به مقصد تهران ترک کرد هوای پاک تهران در ایام نوروز شبی که امام (ره) به جای سرباز بیت نگهبانی داد پاسخ به شایعاتی درباره استخر محل فوت آیت‌الله هاشمی/ تاثیر تصادفات جاده‌ای بر عمل پیوند عضو در ایران/ اعلام نرخ تورم سال ٩٥/ واکنش علی دایی به برد ایران برابر چین/ کارگران «آدمند» نه «آهن»! چرا «ماجرای نیمروز» در سینمای ایران یک اتفاق مهم است؟ رهبران آمریکا و چین به زودی دیدار می‌کنند تبادل اسناد همکاری روسای جمهور ایران و روسیه اولین پس لرزه های «برگزیت»؛ همه پرسی جدایی اسکاتلند از بریتانیا احتمال فروش هواپیمای پیشرفته روسی به ایران روحانی پنجشنبه به گیلان می‌رود ثبت ۲۴ میلیون اقامت نوروزی تا نیمه تعطیلات سه کودک در میانه غرق شدند وب گردی ۴ علت بوی بد دهان! حقیقتی درباره پیوند استرس و سفید شدن مو برگزاری کوچکترین مسابقه اتومبیل رانی جهان بر روی یک قطعه طلا راهنمای خرید یک گوشی هوشمند میان رده مقرون‌به‌صرفه پیدا کردن افراد در اینستاگرام به وسیله شماره موبایل خواص آویشن چیست وقتی کبد چرب سلامت شما را به خطر می اندازد علت ضخیم شدن دیواره قلب چیست و چگونه درمان می شود؟ شناسایی چهره مردی هفتصد ساله به کمک فناوری تشخیص چهره ۶ قابلیت جدید برای اپلیکیشن واتس اپ درد بعد از پرکردن دندان و راه های درمان آن چگونه به بازارهای بین المللی وارد شویم? راه حلی برای از بین بردن بوی سیر دریای مرده کجاست؟ شگفت انگیزترین غارهای جهان (عکس) آب خوردن در این زمان ها ضرر دارد سارقان اخاذ خودرو در شیراز به آخر خط رسیدند آيا ميدانيد؟! پربازدید ها پربحث ترین عناوین تهدید ایران توسط داعش آنهم با زبان فارسی/ سانسور فیلم به خاطر یک شباهت!/ پاداش 12 هزار دلاری فدراسیون به شاگردان کی‌روش/ چرا سیداحمد چند روز پشت سر امام نماز نخواند؟ از «اگر تهمت زنندگان اصلاح شوند، پدرم حلالشان می کند» تا «دوران ترامپ بهترین فرصت برای حل همیشگی مشکلات ایران و آمریکا» از «بزرگترین رقیب روحانی در انتخابات ریاست جمهوری» تا «عذرخواهی حجاریان از اصغر فرهادی» معرفی همه چهره های معروفی که برای شورای شهر تهران کاندیدا شدند + اسامی پایان تلخ آخرین معشوقه دیکتاتور ورود نیروهای کُرد «دموکراتیک سوریه» به رقه، پایتخت احتمالی جدید داعش در دوران پسا رقه و شایعات مربوط به مرگ بشار اسد پشت پرده سفر نوروزی روحانی به روسیه/ انتقاد تند آیت‌الله جوادی‌آملی از بانک ها/ توصیه سخنگوی دولت اصلاحات به رئیس جمهور/ آمار مشاور رهبر انقلاب از تعداد بیکاران/ روایت مهناز افشار از زندگی شخصی با رامین تصاویری از زنان گشت ارشاد اندونزی تهدید ایران در ویدئوی داعش به زبان فارسی! تصاویری از کتک کاری تفریحی در تمرین تیم‌ملی! ادعاهای عجیبب اردوغان علیه ایران علاقه مارچلو لیپی به «کباب کوبیده» ایران1 - چین 0 / چینی ساخت ایتالیا هم در آزادی شکست/دومین عیدی یوزها وکی روش با گل طارمی+جدول جراحی زیبایی حیرت‌آور دختری که چانه نداشت ساعتی که اگر تنظیم شود، نوروز پربارتر خواهد شد آقای احمدی نژاد شب عملیات کربلای۵ کجا بودی؟  (۸۸ نظر) با مشکل بی اعتنایی به «لطفا پارک نکنید» چه باید کرد؟  (۷۷ نظر) تهدید ایران در ویدئوی داعش به زبان فارسی!  (۴۴ نظر) باید ترمز خودروسازها برای افزایش قیمت کشیده شود!  (۴۱ نظر) برخورد جدی دیگری بین شناورهای ایران و آمریکا در تنگه هرمز / افزایش خشونت در رفتار شناورهای آمریکایی  (۳۹ نظر) همه آمده اند؛ از آقازاده ها تا افشاگر، داور، مربی، هنرمند و واعظ منتقد!  (۳۹ نظر) برداشت موز در زرآباد کنارک  (۳۵ نظر) اردوغان کمک به تروریست های منطقه را افتخار می داند؟  (۳۳ نظر) ادعاهای عجیبب اردوغان علیه ایران  (۲۹ نظر) بیماران در ایران از چه حقوقی برخوردارند؟  (۲۹ نظر) تصاویری از زنان گشت ارشاد اندونزی  (۲۳ نظر) درگذشت رییس پلیس راه چابکسر بر اثر تصادف  (۲۳ نظر) تهدید ایران توسط داعش آنهم با زبان فارسی/ سانسور فیلم به خاطر یک شباهت!/ پاداش 12 هزار دلاری فدراسیون به شاگردان کی‌روش/ چرا سیداحمد چند روز پشت سر امام نماز نخواند؟  (۲۲ نظر) خدمات مبتنی بر محتوا در قبوض تلفن همراه چیست؟  (۲۰ نظر) علاقه مارچلو لیپی به «کباب کوبیده»  (۱۳ نظر) فارسی العریبة صفحه نخست تابناک جهان اقتصادی ورزشی اجتماعی مجلس ویدیو انتخابات درباره ما تماس با ما خبرنامه پیوندها جستجو آرشیو آب و هوا اوقات شرعی RSS تمام حقوق مادی و معنوی این سایت متعلق به تابناک می باشد و استفاده از مطالب با ذکر منبع بلامانع است. طراحی و تولید "ایران سامانه"

Earlier this week, Apple launched Clips video creation and sharing app for iPhone and iPad. The report says Google’s new app will come with some of the same features as Clips. With Google’s new app, users can reportedly collaborate and create groups to share and edit photos. The app is said to come with Google’s artificial intelligence capabilities that will help users to tag and organize photos. It would also be able to identify objects in a photograph and then group them. The report did not share any other details of the new app but it will be interesting to see what Google has to offer. Last year, Google launched Allo and Duo apps which have been updated regularly with new features and improvements. It is not known when Google is planning to release the new photo editing app. Source "Google is said to be working on a new social app for sharing and editing photos", 5 out of 5 based on 5 ratings.

The company has announced that it will shut down Google Talks aka Gtalk/GChat feature in Gmail on June 26 and it will be replaced with Hangouts. Users will be  will automatically be transitioned to Hangouts. Gtalk launched in 2005 as an official chat client for Gmail users. In 2013, the company began replacing Google Talk with Hangouts, while still giving users the option to continue using Google Talk. If you are still using the old Google Talk Android app, which was replaced with Hangouts in 2013 in the Google Play Store, that app will now stop working. Moreover, as reported earlier this week, Google is officially killing SMS support for Hangouts for Android on May 22. The company is encouraging Android users to switch over to the newly renamed Android Messages app. After Google removed messaging app on Nexus devices and released an updated Hangouts app that combined SMS and Hangouts conversation at the end of 2014, it released a standalone Messenger app in November 2014, which was recently renamed as Android Messages. Finally, Google is also retiring a number of Gmail Lab add-ons on or around April 24. They include Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews. Finally, two legacy Google+ features in Gmail, the ability to email Google+ profiles and the use of Google+ Circles, will also be retired on April 24.

A new autofill function will be able to store data such as usernames, passwords, addresses or credit card details and automatically fill out forms. Plus, the update brings “Picture in Picture” (PiP) display capabilities for watching a video while using other apps alongside. Android O overhauls notifications too, allowing developers to create themed notification channels, grouping alerts from various apps so users can decide which ones they receive. In general, users will have greater control over notifications and which ones they want to see displayed onscreen. The number of notifications per app will also be displayed, as in iOS. Another visual change comes in the form of adaptive icons, matching the icon style to a user’s particular version of Android, with more rounded or square icon designs in the various manufacturer interfaces. Google has already stated that Android O will support the latest version of Java (8) as well as new wireless technologies like Sony’s LDAC codec for Hi-Res audio. This latest version of Android is expected to land in Google’s latest Pixel smartphones before progressively rolling out from fall this year. Google is yet to announce which sweet snack will lend its name to the latest OS. After Android KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat, could it be time for an Android Oreo? -Relaxnews simangele RELATED ARTICLES International business Stung Mercedes vow to strike back in China TechknowAge Smartphone maker Samsung backs away from planned split TechknowAge Find where you parked your car with Google Maps’s latest update TechknowAge BMW to squeeze more mileage out of luxury segment TechknowAge Hacked websites on the rise: Google NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  The Journal of the American Medical Association.  These are some the most elite academic journals in the world. And last year, one tech company, Alphabet’s Google, published papers in all of them. The unprecedented run of scientific results by the Mountain View search giant touched on everything from ophthalmology to computer games to neuroscience and climate models. For Google, 2016 was an annus mirabilis during which its researchers cracked the top journals and set records for sheer volume. Behind the surge is Google’s growing investment in artificial intelligence, particularly “deep learning,” a technique whose ability to make sense of images and other data is enhancing services like search and translation (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning”). According to the tally Google provided to MIT Technology Review, it published 218 journal or conference papers on machine learning in 2016, nearly twice as many as it did two years ago. We sought out similar data from the Web of Science, a service of Clarivate Analytics, which confirmed the upsurge. Clarivate said that the impact of Google’s publications, according to a measure of publication strength it uses, was four to five times the world average. Compared to all companies that publish prolifically on artificial intelligence, Clarivate ranks Google No. 1 by a wide margin. Top rank The publication explosion is no accident. Google has more than tripled the number of machine learning researchers working for the company over the last few years, according to Yoshua Bengio, a deep-learning specialist at the University of Montreal. “They have recruited like crazy,” he says. And to capture the first-round picks from computation labs, companies can’t only offer a Silicon Valley-sized salary.  “It’s hard to hire people just for money,” says Konrad Kording, a computational neuroscientist at Northwestern University. “The top people care about advancing the world, and that means writing papers the world can use, and writing code the world can use.” At Google, the scientific charge has been spearheaded by DeepMind, the high-concept British AI company started by neuroscientist and programmer Demis Hassabis. Google acquired it for $400 million in 2014.  Hassabis has left no doubt that he’s holding onto his scientific ambitions. In a January blog post, he said DeepMind has a “hybrid culture” between the long-term thinking of an academic department and “the speed and focus of the best startups.” Aligning with academic goals is “important to us personally,” he writes. Kording, one of whose post-doctoral students, Mohammad Azar, was recently hired by DeepMind, says that “it’s perfectly understood that the bulk of the projects advance science.” Recommended for You Elon Musk’s OpenAI Unveils a Simpler Way for Machines to Learn A New Direction for Artificial Intelligence? Customer Service Chatbots Are About to Become Frighteningly Realistic Harvard Scientists Moving Ahead on Plans for Atmospheric Geoengineering Experiments The World’s Largest Artificial Sun Could Help Generate Clean Fuel Last year, DeepMind published twice in Nature, the same storied journal where the structure of DNA and the sequencing of the human genome were first reported. One DeepMind paper concerned its program AlphaGo, which defeated top human players in the ancient game of Go; the other described how a neural network with a working memory could understand and adapt to new tasks. Then, in December, scientists from Google’s research division published the first deep-learning paper ever to appear in JAMA, the august journal of America’s physicians. In it, they showed a deep-learning program could diagnose a cause of blindness from retina images as well as a doctor. That project was led by Google Brain, a different AI group, based out of the company’s California headquarters. It also says it prioritizes publications, noting that researchers there “set their own agenda.” AI battle The contest to develop more powerful AI now involves hundreds of companies, with competition most intense between the top tech giants such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. All see the chance to reap new profits by using the technology to wring more from customer data, to get driverless cars on the road, or in medicine. Research is occurring in a hot house atmosphere reminiscent of the early days of computer chips, or of the first biotech plants and drugs, times when notable academic firsts also laid the foundation stones of new industries. That explains why publication score-keeping matters. The old academic saw “publish or perish” is starting to define the AI race, leaving companies that have weak publication records at a big disadvantage. Apple, famous for strict secrecy around its plans and product launches, found that its culture was hurting its efforts in AI, which have lagged those of Google and Facebook.  So when Apple hired computer scientist Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon last year as its new head of AI, he was immediately allowed to break Apple’s code of secrecy by blogging and giving talks. At a major machine-learning science conference late last year in Barcelona, Salakhutdinov made the point of announcing that Apple would start publishing, too.  He showed a slide: “Can we publish? Yes.” Salakhutdinov will speak at MIT Technology Review’s EmTech Digital event on artificial intelligence next week in San Francisco. Weren't able to make it to EmTech Digital? We've got you covered.

Hopefully by the end of this post, youll have a better understanding of what Google is actually trying to do. TL;DR available at the end of this post. If you remember, Google had already announced that Hangouts would transition to a collaboration/productivity-oriented platform. It announced two new features called Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. Hangouts meet would take advantage of Hangouts video calls with multiple participants to hold meetings. Hangouts Chat is self-explanatory. Hangouts' rebranding aside, Google is announcing that SMS integration with Hangouts will no longer be supported starting on May 22. For those of you using Project Fi or Google Hangouts, this will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. Android Messages is Googles rebranded Google Messenger. It will be dedicated to providing a simple SMS interface and remains the default SMS client for smartphones that otherwise dont have a stock SMS app. Google is also in the process of updating Android Messages to support RCS, which allows for larger attachments and longer text messages than SMS. It will also support read receipts. In addition, Google is fully transitioning Google Talk into Hangouts. Some of us didnt even know folks still used Google Talk, so hearing about it today may be a surprise to some. Also, for those who were still using Google Talk in your Gmail inbox, youll soon be prompted to update to Hangouts. Finally, the Legacy Google Talk app (last updated in 2013) will no longer function effective immediately. TL;DR: Google Talk will completely transition to Hangouts. Hangouts will remain a business and productivity platform. SMS will no longer be integrated into Hangouts as of May 22. Project Fi and Google Voice users will remain unaffected for now. Google will focus Android Messenger's efforts solely to SMS and RCS. Oh yeah, all this while Allo and Duo remain as Googles headlining communication feature, oriented for consumers of all types.

By: AP | San Francisco | Published:March 25, 2017 9:29 am PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube. (Source: AP) An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday.

In cases where management of a Google My Business listing has been handed over to a third party, it can sometimes be difficult for the actual business owner to regain control of their own listing. In these instances, when a business owner cannot get in touch with the current verifier of a listing, users can start the verification process themselves to prove they are in fact the rightful owner or current representative. If you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to follow to reclaim ownership of your GMB listing: Navigate to Google My Business. Sign in to Google with the account you use to manage your business. Enter the name or address of your business, then select it from the search results. You may see a dialog showing part of the email address that verified the listing. If you manage this email address, sign in to that account to access your business listing. Fill out the form. The current listing owner may need to contact you for more info, so you won’t be able to submit your request without sharing your contact details with them. Click Submit. The current listing owner will receive an email asking them to get in touch with you, and you’ll receive a confirmation email. Check on the status of your request by clicking the link in your confirmation email. Allow a full 7 days for the current listing owner to respond to your request. If you don’t hear back after 7 days, you’ll be able to verify your affiliation with the business to gain access to the listing.

The said email has been shared over Reddit and states that the change will come into effect from May 22. The move is believed to be part of Google’s growing focus on the enterprise segment. Google recently launched a ‘Hangouts Meet‘ for corporate video conferencing. In the enterprise segment, Google already competes with Skype, and is now also facing competition from new products like Slack and Microsoft’s Teams.  Coming back to Hangouts, users who have enabled Hangouts as the default SMS app, will be notified from March 27 regarding the change.

The internet giant's core business of serving up advertising along with online search results appeared to be safe from the boycott, motivated by companies seeking assurances that their marketing messages won't be displayed along with hateful or outright terrorist content, particularly videos on Google-operated YouTube. The "backlash" could broaden into a rebellion against the market practice of software programming ad placements, slowing not only Google's revenue but also that of other internet firms, according to Jackdaw chief analyst Jan Dawson. "I would think Google (and parent company Alphabet) would be extremely lucky to emerge from all this with minimal financial impact," he said in a blog post. "I think it's far more likely it sees both a short-term dent in its revenues and profits from the spreading boycotts and possibly a longer-term impact as brands reconsider their commitments to programmatic advertising in general." California-based Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw ads fearing placement alongside extremist content, said this week it is introducing new tools to give firms greater control. "We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn't align with their values," Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post. "We're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content." - Hateful videos - The boycott began last week after the Times newspaper of London found BBC programs were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from Britain for inciting hatred. The analysis found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google had failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the European Union after it anonymously signaled their presence. The British government subsequently put its YouTube advertising on hold, saying in a statement, "it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content." Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, include the BBC, The Guardian newspaper group, McDonalds UK and the British arm of the major advertising agency Havas. The movement spread to the United States this week, with AT&T and Verizon pulling ads from Google. Google's parent Alphabet has lost slightly more than $20 billion in value since the start of this week based on a slip in its share price, in a sign the boycott has made investors nervous. - Limits of software - Still, analysts believe the boycott's overall financial impact should be relatively small given the breadth of Google's advertising activities. Even a "draconian" estimate of fiscal damage was limited to whittling perhaps a percent off Alphabet's revenue, Morgan Stanley said in a note to investors. "It is a hit on their revenue, but it is an even bigger hit on their brand; on their reputation," Altimeter Group principal analyst Charlene Li said. "Google hasn't taken it seriously enough." She recommended that Google engage advertisers directly and openly. A solution may not be easy. Google needs to strike a balance between pleasing advertisers and those who upload videos to YouTube and are free to take their creations elsewhere if unsatisfied with their shares of ad revenue. Google's setbacks could benefit traditional television networks as ad dollars return there from YouTube or stall a shift to online, Morgan Stanley said. Google rivals such as Facebook could also benefit if they prove safer havens for digital advertising. Above all, the boycott highlights the limits of "programmatic" advertising, the practice of letting software algorithms decide pairing between marketing messages and content sought by online viewers. The technology is broadly used by internet firms, which heavily rely on software and artificial intelligence to figure out what ads will interest people at any given moment. Advertisers can chose "keywords" for targeting their ads, or sometimes use demographic options such as age groups or where people live. Read More Google and the leading social network Facebook stopped publishing ads on websites posting sensational and fabricated stories following controversy about the role "fake news" may have played in the US presidential election last year. In February, YouTube ended an advertising partnership with its biggest star, PewDiePie, who had published videos containing anti-Semitic insults and Nazi references. The boycott will push for programmatic ad software to become more precise and better understand the content offered for pairing in order to reduce risks for advertisers, Li said.

(Barbara Ortutay) Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is "laser-focused" on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this story. Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Google Inc.

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Walmart and Dish joined an already impressive list of companies that have pulled their ads from the search giant over concerns the Silicon Valley giant isn’t able to ensure their ads will not pop up on unsavory sites or be attached to scummy videos. Google said it was stepping up its efforts to protect the brands. However, it might not be happening as quickly or be as effective as the advertisers had hoped. The four companies said they were suspending their ads on YouTube and on Google’s ad exchange after the Wall Street Journal reported that some ads were still being placed against anti-Semitic content. Other advertisers, including Starbucks, General Motors and FX Networks, said they were suspending their various activities with Google. Google has been ratcheting up its game — hiring more people and talking with advertisers about its efforts — to prevent ads appearing in objectionable content. The Friday exodus comes after a week of nonstop negative press that was kicked off by a March 17 Times of London report that resulted in an entire ad agency holding company yanking ads for all of its clients. Walmart, in a statement, said, “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values.” Google parent Alphabet has seen its market cap shrink by about $26 billion in a week. Its shares have fallen 4.5 percent since March 17, to $814.43 on Friday. Alphabet was downgraded on Monday by Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research which warned that unless Google could say its systems are foolproof it would continue to suffer from the fallout. Google has said it is retooling its video verification process and introducing new artificial intelligence in response to the problem. In an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg, Google added it would create a new hot line manned by humans. The WSJ found ads from Google’s own YouTube Red subscription service running on racist videos containing the “n—–” in the title. The ads are served up typically as part of automated or programmatic ad programs that deliver traffic to advertisers from across the web. Some marketers put filters to screen out blacklisted Web sites.

For those who are wondering how official this announcement is, Google has since confirmed on their blog that this indeed will be happening over the course of the next couple of months. According to Google, “In the next few weeks, you’ll see a notification in the classic Hangouts app to switch to another SMS app already on your phone for SMS, or to download Android Messages if one isn’t available. Choosing a new messaging app will not impact your SMS message history, and all your messages will be accessible in whichever new app you choose.” With Google starting to make Hangouts more enterprise focused with Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat, there are some who are speculating that the removal of SMS is part of their plan to perhaps create their own version of Slack or Microsoft Teams where Hangouts will be used as a tool for communications in the work space. Google has reassured users that the consumer version of Hangouts will not be going anywhere so for those who use it to chat with friends, it’s business as usual. However if you are looking for SMS integration, like Google said you can consider the Android Messages app as an alternative. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Apps, Google and hangouts.

Although the current Hangouts app isn’t going away just yet, Google plans to start taking away some of its capabilities, starting with the removal of SMS functions. According to an email sent to GSuite administrators and subsequently posted to Reddit, Google will remove the SMS messaging feature from Hangouts on May 22. Hangouts users will reportedly be notified of this change via an in-app message starting March 27, and prompted to select a new default messaging app from the ones that are installed on the phone or to download a new one. If you are a Google Voice users you will still be able to send SMS texts from both Hangouts or the Google Voice app, just not using your carrier number anymore, only your Voice number. The company is likely trying to remove any associations Hangouts has with traditional SMS messaging, so it can position Hangouts Chat as more of a business collaboration tool, and leaving carrier SMS texts to the native Android Messages client or Allo — yes, Google’s messaging strategy has been a kind of a mess over the last few years and the company is trying to correct course.

When you write “Is s*x …?” into Google, the first thing to pop up is, “is s*x addiction real?” To answer this, the Daily Star Online spoke to Rebecca Dakin, The Great British Sexpert who revealed not only is is real, but it can consume your entire life. “Yes, it is a very real thing,” Rebecca said. “It is much more common now because of the Internet and the access to P0*n which is so readily available.” “It involves lack of control along with s*xual urges and behaviours, however it isn’t recognised medically as there is a debate of whether it’s just an excuse for infidelity.” Addiction to s*x can be likened to any other addiction – whether it be food, alcohol, caffeine – and can also be referred to as hyper s*xual behaviour or nymphomania. “In extreme cases, people want to have s*x multiple times a day and are constantly thinking about it,” Rebecca explained. “They could just be walking down the street and get a sudden urge and then will have to find the nearest bathroom just so they can relieve themselves. It can take over your life.” Rebecca explained it is difficult to know the exact number of people who suffer from the addiction as women don’t generally want to admit to it. “There is still a stigma around women who enjoy s*x as they are seen as ‘promiscuous’ or it’s shameful, and they are judged. So there are many women with s*x addictions who go undiagnosed,” she said. “s*x addiction can affect men and women at many different stages in their lives. There is a rise in younger, school-aged children because they have access to the internet at a younger age.” If you feel like you have a s*x addiction, Rebecca advised to do some research online first and see if you have any of the symptoms. With this knowledge, you can then seek help. Rebecca, who is a trained therapist, uses hypnotherapy on her clients to help them suppress their urges. Yet she said other options include psychotherapy, behavioural therapy, s*x addiction groups and in extreme cases, medication. However, if you think your partner is the one who suffers from addiction, communication is key. “You have to be able to talk openly with your partner and broach the topic sensitively,” she said. “Explore the options before you bring it up. In my experience you can’t just turn around to someone with an addiction and say you’re an addict. They have to figure it out for themselves. Be sensitive to how they may be feeling about it.” Rebecca said one of the things that can happen when you are in a relationship with some who is a s*x addict is the partner can feel they are seen as just s*x rather than a person, and a “lot of resentment building up there”. To avoid this, talk to your partner about it and figure out a way you can work through it together.

An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening in a sign of the skepticism surrounding Google’s promise to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Dish Network became the latest companies to suspend their advertising on YouTube after The Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. Even though the defections are continuing, most analysts aren’t worried yet. Starbucks and General Motors also joined in the YouTube boycott Friday, March 24, 2017. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File) Posted: Friday, March 24, 2017 12:15 pm More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott Associated Press | 0 comments SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is "laser-focused" on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. ___ AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this story. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Is DARPA’s Memex search engine a Google-killer? 14 Apr 2015 19 Google Post navigation Previous: Season 5 Game of Thrones episodes leaked online Next: Teen charged after using teacher’s admin password to access school computer by Mark Stockley 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit The history of computing features a succession of organisations that looked, for a while at least, as if they were so deeply embedded in our lives that we’d never do without them. IBM looked like that, and Microsoft did too. More recently it’s been Google and Facebook. Sometimes they look unassailable because, in the narrow territory they occupy, they are. When they do fall it isn’t because somebody storms that territory, they fall because the ground beneath them shifts. For years and years Linux enthusiasts proclaimed “this will be the year that Linux finally competes with Windows on the desktop!”, and every year it wasn’t. But Linux, under the brand name Android, eventually smoked Microsoft when ‘Desktop’ gave way to ‘Mobile’. Google has been the 800-pound gorilla of web search since the late 1990s and all attempts to out-Google it have failed. Its market share is rock solid and it’s seen off all challengers from lumbering tech leviathans to nimble and disruptive startups. Google will not cede its territory to a Google clone but it might one day find that its territory is not what it was. The web is getting deeper and darker and Google, Bing and Yahoo don’t actually search most of it. They don’t search the sites on anonymous, encrypted networks like Tor and I2P (the so-called Dark Web) and they don’t search the sites that have either asked to be ignored or that can’t be found by following links from other websites (the vast, virtual wasteland known as the Deep Web). The big search engines don’t ignore the Deep Web because there’s some impenetrable technical barrier that prevents them from indexing it – they do it because they’re commercial entities and the costs and benefits of searching beyond their current horizons don’t stack up. That’s fine for most of us, most of the time, but it means that there are a lot of sites that go un-indexed and lots of searches that the current crop of engines are very bad at. That’s why the US’s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) invented a search engine for the deep web called Memex. Memex is designed to go beyond the one-size-fits-all approach of Google and deliver the domain-specific searches that are the very best solution for narrow interests. In its first year it’s been tackling the problems of human trafficking and slavery – things that, according to DARPA, have a significant presence beyond the gaze of commercial search engines. When we first reported on Memex in February, we knew that it would have potential far beyond that. What we didn’t know was that parts of it would become available more widely, to the likes of you and me. A lot of the project is still somewhat murky and most of the 17 technology partners involved are still unnamed, but the plan seems to be to lift the veil, at least partially, over the next two years, starting this Friday. That’s when an initial tranche of Memex components, including software from a team called Hyperion Gray, will be listed on DARPA’s Open Catalog. The Hyperion Gray team described their work to Forbes as: Advanced web crawling and scraping technologies, with a dose of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, with the goal of being able to retrieve virtually any content on the internet in an automated way. Eventually our system will be like an army of robot interns that can find stuff for you on the web, while you do important things like watch cat videos. More components will follow in December and, by the time the project wraps, a “general purpose technology” will be available. Memex and Google don’t overlap much, they solve different problems, they serve different needs and they’re funded in very different ways. But so were Linux and Microsoft. The tools that DARPA releases at the end of the project probably won’t be a direct competitor to Google but I expect they will be mature and better suited to certain government and business applications than Google is. That might not matter to Google but there are three reasons why Memex might catch its eye. The first is not news but it’s true none the less – the web is changing and so is internet use. When Google started there was no Snapchat, Bitcoin or Facebook. Nobody cared about the Deep Web because it was hard enough to find the things you actually wanted and nobody cared about the Dark Web (remember FreeNet?) because nobody knew what it was for. The second is this statement made by Christopher White, the man heading up the Memex team at DARPA, who’s clearly thinking big: The problem we're trying to address is that currently access to web content is mediated by a few very large commercial search engines - Google, Microsoft Bing, Yahoo - and essentially it's a one-size fits all interface... We've started with one domain, the human trafficking domain ... In the end we want it to be useful for any domain of interest. That's our ambitious goal: to enable a new kind of search engine, a new way to access public web content And the third is what we’ve just discovered – Memex isn’t just for spooks and G-Men, it’s for the rest of us to use and, more importantly, to play with. It’s one thing to use software and quite another to be able to change it. The beauty of open source software is that people are free to take it in new directions – just like Google did when it picked up Linux and turned it into Android.

Reply Mark Stockley says: April 14, 2015 at 1:58 pm I guess this is a rhetorical question but so our readers are clear – the Deep Web is everything beyond the ‘event horizon’ of commercial search engines. Reply 3th3r says: April 14, 2015 at 7:03 pm Erm no. The true deep web is deeper than that. It contains sites which cannot even be connected to unless you are on an anonymized distributed network and the sites have a TLD of .onion. Reply Mark Stockley says: April 14, 2015 at 9:41 pm At Naked Security we use Deep Web and Dark Web as follows (because we think it’s how they’re most commonly understood): Deep Web refers to sites on the World Wide Web that could be indexed by commercial search engines but aren’t because there are no references to them or because they’ve elected not to be indexed. Dark Web refers to the collection of websites on encrypted networks like I2P and Tor that you’re referring to. The Dark Web is a subset of Deep Web – it is true that sites on Tor are beyond the search horizon of commercial search engines but it is not true that all sites beyond the search horizon of commercial search engines are on Tor. Interestingly it’s a bit muddier than that – some .onion site content is available on the WWW, and indexable by Google, as a result of Tor2Web services like Onion City. https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/02/18/onion-city-a-search-engine-bringing-the-dark-web-into-the-light/ Reply Chris says: April 14, 2015 at 2:01 pm That’s deep, man.

It sounds like the basis to a God AI. Something out of Eagle Eye or Person of Interest. Especially if it actually gets smarter based on what it “reads.” Reply Ken says: April 14, 2015 at 5:57 pm “You are being watched. The government has a secret system: a machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I know, because I built it. I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything. Violent crimes involving ordinary people; people like you. Crimes the government considered ‘irrelevant’. They wouldn’t act, so I decided I would. But I needed a partner, someone with the skills to intervene. Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

Any connection? Check out this web page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex_Technology_Limited Reply Laurence Marks says: April 14, 2015 at 7:49 pm No. The word memex (a portmanteau or word-combination of “memory” and “index”) was the subject of a 1945 paper by Vannevar Bush envisioning a future device very similar to today’s Apple or Android tablets. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex Reply puravidatf121 says: April 15, 2015 at 5:59 am Since DARPA is funded by … well you know who. It would seem to me this would just be another means of “TRACKING” folks. If the “Web absent of Light” which supposedly contains a large number of “Obscure” web sites with sometimes nefarious subject matter. Well I can’t help but think that if an individual were to search for said subject matter it would tag that search for follow-up. I’m just not buyin into a Government funded agency creating a Search Engine that should theoretically allow the user to be “Anonymous” unless of course their terms of use clearly state otherwise. I mean it’s already easy enough for L.E.O. to sit back and just watch the AZZHats post their illegal activities on You-Tube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. A search engine like this is just another tool for their use. Reply Mark Stockley says: April 15, 2015 at 11:30 am Government is a massive, many-headed beast. Don’t forget that the US Navy and DARPA developed and funded both the ARPANET (from which the Deep Web grew) and Tor (which makes up most of the Dark Web). By your own logic they wouldn’t need Memex to track people because they created the environments that Memex will be tracking you in. Memex components will be open source, like Tor, which means you’ll be free to find and remove any tracking you discover and give other people your tracking-free versions.

And then, could they not make it (the data) available publicly, after you “click/sign” some waiver? Maybe even have to pay some triffle sum (say through Paypal (or whomever) for the privilege…. So now you could use the data on all of Google’s other properties. Gmail, Youtube, G+, etc…. And maybe use it on all of Microsoft’;s properties. Hum. The plot could be easily thickened. Because your “search” would then NOT be your search, but say a Google search… Good for paranoids. What DO you think, Sophos? Reply Mark Stockley says: April 15, 2015 at 11:34 am Google, MS et al will be free to access, use and reuse Memex components, and so will you. Tech start-ups will make hay with this.

(Photo by Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post) Print Email The Washington Post By The Washington Post The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on March 24, 2017 at 7:10 PM comments As the owner of a small business in liberal Massachusetts, John Ellis was a natural sympathizer of the nationwide call for advertisers to boycott Breitbart News, with its hard-edge conservative politics and close ties to President Donald Trump. But it made Ellis wonder about other, more extreme right-wing sites: Who is placing ads on them? A few clicks around the Internet revealed a troubling answer: He was. On a website owned by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer, Ellis saw an ad for his engineering company, Optics for Hire, pop up on the screen - even though he had never knowingly bought the ad. What Ellis had stumbled on was a little-known facet of the booming world of Internet advertising. Businesses using the latest in online advertising technology offered by Google, Yahoo and major competitors are also increasingly finding their ads placed alongside politically extreme and derogatory content. That's because the ad networks offered by Google, Yahoo and others can display ads on vast numbers of third-party websites based on people's search and browsing histories. Although the strategy gives advertisers an unprecedented ability to reach customers who fit a narrow profile, it dramatically curtails their ability to control where their advertisements appear. "No one has any idea where their ads are going," Ellis said. In some cases, he added, ad networks "are monetizing hate." In a sign of growing frustration, AT&T, Verizon and other leading companies this week pulled their business from Google's AdSense network in response to news reports that ads had appeared with propaganda from the Islamic State and violent groups. But the issue is broader. A Washington Post examination of dozens of sites with politically extreme and derogatory content found that many were customers of leading ad networks, which share a portion of revenue gleaned from advertisers with the site's operators. The Post's examination found that the networks had displayed ads for Allstate, IBM, DirectTV and dozens of other household brand names on websites with content containing racial and ethnic slurs, Holocaust denial and disparaging comments about African Americans, Jews, women and gay people. Some of these sites, the Post found, featured hateful and derogatory content throughout. In others, it was confined to comment sections, where users went far beyond the language used by the sites' writers, whose expressed views fell closer to the political mainstream. Google's AdSense, for example, last month ran ads for several firms alongside comments using a slur for African-Americans, saying "hang them all." Other Google-displayed ads, for Macy's and the genetics company 23andMe, appeared on the website My Posting Career, which describes itself as a "white privilege zone," next to a notice saying the site would offer a referral bonus for each member related to Adolf Hitler. "No business wants to be associated with sites like that," said Andy Kill, spokesman for genetic testing company 23andMe. "If you're trusting an ad algorithm to do this, this is what can happen," he said. "It's frustrating." My Posting Career did not reply to an email seeking comment. The problem has emerged as Web advertising strategies have evolved. Advertisers sometimes choose to place their ads on particular sites - or avoid sites they dislike - but a growing share of advertising budgets go to what the industry calls "programmatic" buys. These ads are aimed at people whose demographic or consumer profile is receptive to a marketing message, no matter where they browse on the Internet. Algorithms decide where to place ads, based on people's prior Web usage, across vastly different types of sites. The technology companies behind ad networks have slowly begun to address the issue but warn that it won't be easy to solve. They say their algorithms struggle to distinguish between content that is truly offensive and language that is not offensive in context. For example, it can be hard for computers to determine the difference between the use of a racial slur on a white-supremacy site and a website about history. The tech companies have also long been reluctant to put themselves in the position of an arbiter of speech - given the subjectivity involved and the legal risk of making decisions about what content deserves to be read or not. It's a situation that tech giants are increasingly encountering in related spheres, too, with the proliferation of false and highly politicized news sites spreading misinformation on social networks. On Monday, following inquiries from The Post and requests from advertisers who also had been contacted by The Post, Google apologized to advertisers. It announced it would be conducting an "extensive review" of ad policies with the goal of taking a tougher stance on "hateful, offensive, and derogatory content." Google said such comments violate its hate-speech policies but would not say whether it had taken action against the sites. The company said it reviews thousands of sites each day for violations and booted more than 100,000 publishers - including many single-author publishers - from its AdSense network in 2016. Yahoo, which blocked one site that was the subject of a query by The Post, said it condemns racist or other hateful speech, adding, "Of the billions of ads served on a daily basis, there are rare instances when automated ad platforms serve ads in places they shouldn't." (The Washington Post sometimes uses such networks to place ads touting its offerings, such as subscriptions, and also generates revenue featuring ads sold through advertising networks.) Many of the companies contacted for this story - including IBM, bareMinerals, Macy's, Everquote and Allstate - expressed surprise and dismay that their ads appeared near derogatory content. Several said they had requested that networks blacklist those pages, which is easy to do for individual sites but not for entire categories of sites. Automated filters typically miss certain kinds of derogatory speech, and tech companies traditionally have not hired the massive number of people necessary to carefully monitor content on billions of Web pages. Some advertisers also expressed frustration that ad networks had failed to keep marketing messages from appearing alongside reader comments that might upset customers - even on sites that themselves do not promote extremist content. Google's AdSense, for example, displayed an ad for cosmetics company bareMinerals in the comments section of Weaselzippers.us, an aggregator of conservative news. A user comment on the site used a derogatory word for gay men and said they should be "lying in a pool of blood." When The Post emailed an image of the Web page to bareMinerals spokeswoman Joanne Chiu Sulit, she said, "I was shocked that we were on that site." An email to Weaselzippers.us operators was not returned. - - - The issue of ad placements has become charged in an era of rising political polarization. The number of right-wing hate sites, as well as sites that traffic in sensationalist news and hoaxes, has doubled over the past year, according to ad auditing firm DoubleVerify. With so many new sites, it's difficult for advertisers to avoid having their ads appear in unwelcome places. "It's whack-a-mole," said Wayne Gattinella, chief executive of DoubleVerify. "You can flag keywords. You can use algorithmic decision-making to minimize it, but there is no way to filter the word choice in real time." Advertisers generally have little choice but to depend on ad networks. The major ones have policies prohibiting advertising on sites featuring discriminatory or hateful speech, but The Post found dozens of apparent violations. Many of the sites where The Post found violations are considered hate sites by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an advocacy group that tracks hate speech. "[Ad networks] have rules in place, but they don't enforce them," said Jillian York, an advocate with the Electronic Freedom Foundation, which runs Online Censorship, a program pushing technology companies to clarify why they remove content. Last month, an ad for insurance company Allstate appeared on Alternative-Right.BlogSpot.com, whose comments section praised "Hitler and his National Socialists as a visionary." Allstate said it has tried to avoid such sites through filters. "Allstate does not knowingly advertise on media that provokes hate or includes threatening, discriminatory or offensive language," spokeswoman Laura Strykowski said. Everquote and DirectTV ads appeared on Spencer's site, RadixJournal.com, alongside comments decrying the Catholic Church for advocating racial mixing and deluging white, Christian countries with "savages of the worst kind." DirectTV declined to comment. Everquote said that although it uses ad networks, "We specifically require that these advertising networks refrain from placing our ads on any sites containing and/or relating to, among other things, violence, sex, racism, sexism, pornography, illegal or potentially illegal subject matter, negative publicity or any other highly explosive subject matter." Ads for Macy's, Amazon.com, and even Planned Parenthood, appeared on the racially inflammatory website My Posting Career. Ads to shop on Amazon.com appeared on a site with an article headlined "Yes, I am a Nazi," and a comments sections peppered with profanity and racial slurs. Amazon, which also runs an ad network, declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.) - - - Silicon Valley companies long have resisted calls to more aggressively police content on their platforms, saying a free and open Internet is the underpinning of the Web itself. With the exception of child pornography, Congress largely has agreed with the Silicon Valley viewpoint, leaving tech companies substantial legal leeway to monitor - or not - the content that appears on the sites and platforms that they operate. But advertisers are demanding changes. "[Tech companies] are struggling to adjust to a reality where the same tools that enabled them to connect the world are now being used to drive it apart," entrepreneur and venture capitalist Noah Lichtenstein said. "This is the crisis of our time: How do you balance the desire to have the Web be open and connected with a rising tide of institutionalized hate and the protection of those who are being attacked?" It's not clear how effective the push to deprive such sites of advertising will be. Spencer said targeting Radix Journal and similar sites is unfair to advertisers because they have so little control over where their ads appear. And if the goal is to deprive extreme sites of money, he predicted the effort would have little effect because the revenue from Web ads is so small, totaling at most a few thousand dollars a year. "If I were kicked off of all of these things, it would have no effect on my life whatsoever," Spencer said. Emails to contact information listed for Alternative-Right.blogspot.com received no reply. Breitbart News also did not return emails seeking comment about the advertising boycott directed against the site. Disqus, a Silicon Valley start-up that manages comments sections for 4 million sites, including those for Breitbart News, Radix Journal and Occidental Dissent, sells advertising alongside the comments. It has been trying to work through the issues raised by inflammatory content, said chief executive Daniel Ha, adding that the company has been flooded with complaints about hate speech from users, advertisers and employees. "User-generated content has always been extremely chaotic, and that's part of what makes the Internet so amazing - you can share very unpopular ideas," Ha said. "I think, however, that we've seen in the last year that there's a bigger responsibility for how that affects society." The company's terms and conditions prohibit instances of "extreme discrimination" on its comment boards, and a team of 10 reviewers makes the judgment calls. He said the line between "targeted harassment that feels violent" vs. someone making an off-color joke isn't always clear. In a blog post last month, the company announced a new tool that allows users to flag offensive comments. But the software is still largely untested. Ha said he had blocked three of the extremist sites after being contacted by The Post. One of them, the neo-Confederate site Occidental Dissent, used the development to make a public call for more donations, earning what site founder Brad Griffin said was about $1,000 - several times more than the advertisements had produced in recent months. "It worked out nice for me," Griffin said. --- Authors Information: Craig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Post.

See Offers Business Posted March 24 Updated March 24 increase font size Maine internet providers blast Senate vote to strip customers’ privacy protection Sen. Susan Collins voted with fellow Republicans to repeal rules preventing broadband providers from selling consumers' personal data. By Colin WoodardStaff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-791-6317 Share Comment Read Article The heads of two Maine-based internet service providers blasted an ongoing congressional effort to repeal privacy protections for their customers Friday, saying it is wrongheaded and an invasion of privacy. Sen. Susan Collins joined her Republican colleagues Thursday in voting to overturn landmark privacy protections for broadband internet customers, making it easier for internet service providers to collect, sell and share detailed information about individuals’ web browsing, app usage, personal movements and internet search terms without their consent. Fletcher Kittredge, CEO and founder of GWI, seen in 2013, says, "If you're monitoring someone's web connection, you know what they think, who they associate with and every intimate detail about them," so service providers should have to get subscribers' consent before they collect, sell and share the information. File photo/Gabe Souza Susan Corbett, owner of Machias-based internet service provider Axiom Technologies, says, "We believe customers have a right to know if a company is selling or using their data." Contributed photo/Topher Cox Related Headlines Senate votes to block start of new protections for consumers’ internet data Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → The vote broke along party lines, with 52 Republicans voting in favor of repealing the protections. Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, voted against it. Fletcher Kittredge, founder and CEO of Biddeford Internet Corp., which does business as GWI, said the vote was “absolutely appalling” and a threat to everyone who uses the internet. “This is very, very bad,” he said. “Your ISP can look at your traffic and discover the most intimate details of your life, and selling that information will ultimately be more valuable than selling the internet connection, which is something libertarians and civil libertarians ought to worry about, especially as the government and hackers will ultimately have access to it.” The House, which also is controlled by Republicans, is expected to take up the measure early next week. The privacy protections, which were to go into effect later this year, would require that internet providers obtain permission from subscribers before sharing or selling data on their users’ browsing, internet use, geo-location history and other information. Currently, broadband providers can collect all of that information unless a user tells them not to collect it. The adoption of the rules in October by the Federal Communications Commission was bitterly opposed by major internet providers like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon Communications, which argued they would result in higher costs for consumers because they would reduce the opportunity to profit from the sale of precision-targeted advertising. But Kittredge and the head of a Machias-based internet provider, Susan Corbett of Axiom, disagree with their national competitors, saying the measures are a clear threat to their customers. They note that internet providers – unlike web services like Google or Facebook – have the ability to collect the full picture of everything you do, from the video feed of your smart television to what disease you just looked up on the internet. “As an internet service provider we have access to individual’s data, where and how they surf the web, the sites they frequent and other important information most customers would be uncomfortable sharing,” Corbett said in an email. “We believe customers have a right to know if a company is selling or using their data in a way that invades their privacy and should be given a choice to decide for themselves.” Kittredge said the situation will get worse with the continued expansion of the “internet of things,” where cars, household appliances, home security cameras, baby monitors, and other devices become connected to the internet. “If you’re monitoring someone’s web connection, you know what they think, who they associate with and every intimate detail about them,” he said. “When you add access to video and audio feeds of what is going on in the house, they will know more about you than you know about yourself.” He said history suggests all that data, if collected by your internet service provider, will be available to the government and hackers, and for sale. “I’m sure my competitors are seeing dollar signs, but in the long run I think it’s a really bad idea because it reduces the value of an internet connection when you can’t trust your ISP.” He said his company would collect and sell such information “over my dead body,” but it puts GWI at a competitive disadvantage against its competitors. He also said he found it “deeply upsetting” that Collins voted for the measure. “As a Republican who is very close to becoming a former Republican, this goes against every principle and precept I thought the party had.” Collins spokeswoman Annie Clark defended Collins’ vote in a statement to the Portland Press Herald, saying that the Obama administration’s “new so-called ‘privacy’ rule” had “created an inconsistent, confusing standard.” “This new rule put extensive restrictions on internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast, while leaving much less strict standards in place for edge providers like Google and Facebook,” Clark said. “This inconsistency created confusion for consumers, competitive disadvantages for internet service providers, and limited broadband innovation without ensuring privacy for internet users. Therefore, Senator Collins voted to eliminate this misguided rule and looks forward to internet privacy rules that apply consistently to all providers.” But Kittredge says that argument doesn’t hold water, for two reasons: First, he said, you can avoid using Facebook or Google, but everyone has to have an internet provider. Second, internet providers like his company collect everything, whereas web service providers like Google and Facebook have only a partial picture of an individual’s online activity. “An ISP sees everything and can put it all together and draw inferences,” he said. “If you’re worried about inconsistency then the thing to do is apply the same rules to Google and Facebook, not say, ‘Geez, someone else is robbing you, so our remedy is to allow everyone to rob you.” King’s spokesman issued a statement on the senator’s vote that echoed many of the same points. “Broadband providers can see nearly everything that someone does online, from what sites they access to where they are physically located when they do it, which is why Senator King believes that they must be required to obtain a person’s consent before sharing that data with third-parties,” spokesman Scott Ogden said in an email. He said King understands the concerns of those looking for consistent standards, but noted that repealing the rule does not accomplish it, since the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that regulates web services like Google, has no jurisdiction over internet providers. “The result will be that broadband subscribers are left with no privacy or data security protections at all, and he thinks that’s a mistake that will compromise the personal information of millions of Americans,” Ogden said. The cable industry’s trade association applauded the repeal, describing it as a “step toward reversing the FCC’s misguided approach” and “restoring a consistent approach to online privacy that consumers want and deserve.” The Republican sponsor of the bill and President Trump’s new FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, have both said that the rules are onerous, and that it is unfair that internet providers would face these regulations when web companies like Google or Facebook do not. “It’s unnecessary, confusing, and adds another innovation-stifling regulation,” bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said when he introduced the measure last fall. Civil liberties groups have opposed the effort to repeal the privacy rules. “We’re disappointed that the Senate – including Senator Collins – voted against protecting the basic privacy of Mainers and all constituents in favor of protecting corporate profit,” said Oamshri Amarasingham, advocacy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. “We believe we should have to consent to sharing sensitive information with the rest of the world when we use the internet. We hope that the House will stop this from moving forward.” Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, D-1st District, said she will oppose repealing the regulations when the bill comes before the House. “It is unconscionable that the House and Senate leadership have chosen to make repealing broadband consumer privacy rights a top legislative priority in Congress when there is so much to be done to bring broadband access to Americans,” Pingree said via email. “I do not support this invasive resolution and strongly believe that internet service providers should not be given a blank check to collect data on their customers just to help companies boost their advertising.” A spokesman for Maine’s other House member, Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin, said he was undecided. “The congressman will closely review the legislation if it is brought up in the House,” Brendan Conley said via email. “He wants to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where consumers are protected consistently across the internet and gaps in consumer protection are not created.” Colin Woodard can be contacted at 791-6317 or at: [email protected] Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.

Which is the baby wipe anniversary, I believe. Or perhaps the Swiffer anniversary. Either way, we had no money for gifts after Googling local preschool prices. But it didn't matter. The sun was shining. I was wearing a skirt and non-pregnancy underwear. And my mother-in-law was in town, happily volunteering to watch our adorable spawn so we could drink wine at a restaurant while not simultaneously dodging baby headbutts for once. It was just what two stressed-out parents of small children needed. So, naturally, we spent most of the day in the emergency room. What happened, you ask? Good question. I still don't know. But to sum up, I felt like I was dying for 45 minutes and then felt completely fine. After an exam and some tests and an ultrasound, it was discovered that I had a very serious case of absolutely nothing being wrong with me. My official diagnosis was "um.your gallbladder, maybe?" followed by that shoulder shrug emoji. It was just what two stressed-out parents of small children didn't need. Instead of a nice dinner and adult cocktails not served in a sippy cup and a clumsy make-out session in the driveway, we have an unnecessary medical bill heading our way. Love. Ain't it grand? But that's what marriage looks like after seven years and two kids and one aging dog. Reality has replaced all the dopamine. You don't generally have time to be all lovey-dovey. Or shoot, even lovey at this point. We're lucky if we have a free hand to occasionally high-five one another. So, you have to show your love in other ways. It's saying "I'll clean up the dog vomit." It's saying "make sure you eat something." It's saying, "I duct-taped that one part of the dishwasher so it won't make the high-pitched noise that you hate anymore." It's hearing the baby cry in the middle of the night, again, followed by hearing, "Go back to sleep, I got her." It's hearing your partner use every curse word ever invented as they try to get said baby back to sleep and not judging them. It's hearing those three most beautiful words in the English language, "Take a nap." It's hearing the blissful laughter of small children who are being thoroughly entertained and distracted by another adult so you can spend six and a half minutes alone in the bathroom. It's making a big breakfast every morning even though you're exhausted because it's likely the only meal the two of you will get to eat together. It's the arms from out of nowhere that hug you from behind while you're standing at the kitchen sink stress-eating cheese. It's laughing off the fact the other person tried to karate chop your face when you hugged them from behind because it startled them because it's been so long since you two were able to touch in a manner that didn't include passing a small child back and forth. It's coming home with a bottle of wine when you know they've had a bad day. It's coming home with a handle of Captain Morgan when you know they've had a bad week. It's springing for the extra pizza topping even though money is tight because they deserve sausage and pepperoni, dammit. It's saving the last doughnut for them but they're saving the last doughnut for you, so said doughnut just sits there until it becomes inedible and you finally throw away the glazed petrified disk five days later. It's refraining from watching the next episode of "West World" for nine days straight because the other one is too tired to make it through an entire hourlong show once the kids are asleep. It's chugging coffee at 7:30 p.m. so you can finally make it through an episode of "West World" because the other one has been so patient for the past nine days. It's having inside jokes, which are made only funnier because you're both suffering from extreme sleep deprivation. It's giving them a firm, even stern, pep talk when they dare to start to doubt themselves. It's carrying around two kids all day and carrying an old dog up and down the stairs and still wanting to hear about their day no matter how tired you are. It's going to work all day and carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders and still wanting to hear all about how the baby almost crawled today. It's knowing that this is one of the hardest yet best times in both your lives. Which is why you rush home from work in a panic when your loved one calls and says, "I think I need to go the emergency room." And why, when you are curled up in the fetal position on the floor, writhing in mysterious pain, your only thought is that you can't die because you love all these people too much. Happy anniversary, Ryan. I love you. And the best gift I can give you after all these years is to let you know I wouldn't change a thing. Also, we're out of baby wipes.

"A week after Google apologized for running customers' advertisements alongside objectionable videos, triggering a change in policy, its YouTube site is still rife with examples that are angering more big advertisers and causing some to cut spending with the tech giant," reports the Dow Jones Newswire. Reporters from the Wall Street Journal spotted ads from Microsoft, Amazon, and Procter & Gamble appearing on hate videos -- and thus indirectly funding them. An anonymous reader quotes their report: Asked about the Journal's finding that their ads were still appearing with such content on YouTube as of Thursday night, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dish Network Corp. said Friday they were suspending spending on all Google advertising except targeted search ads. Starbucks Corp. and General Motors Co. said they were pulling their ads from YouTube. FX Networks, part of 21st Century Fox Inc., said it was suspending all advertising spending on Google, including search ads and YouTube. Wal-Mart said: "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values." An executive at one of the affected companies complained that Google "had assured us over the past few days that our brands were safe from this type of content. Despite their assurances, it's clear they couldn't give assurance." google youtube advertising ← Related Links → SAS Mocked For Recommending 60% Proprietary Software, 40% Open Source YouTube Says Content Owners Made $1B Last Year -- So Music Labels Should Stop Complaining Google To Revamp Policies, Hire Staff After UK Ad Scandal YouTube Loses Major Advertisers Over Offensive Videos Terrifying Anti-Riot Vehicle Created To Quash Any Urban Disturbance Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos More | Reply Login Still More Advertisers Pull Google Ads Over YouTube Hate Videos Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

[freepresshouston.com] 'Free speech' has become a mantra for bullying the people whose opinion is that there are things they don't like and don't want to see; but that in itself becomes a kind of censorship. Not by the government, but by other groups - and it is extremely easy to bombard websites with updates that drown out opinions that you as a person or group don't like. Ideally, if all people were honest and genuinely played by the rules of good citizenship etc, free speech would be truly free, but it only takes a small minority of bullies to take that away. Governments in democratic countries don't actually want to limit people's freedom of speech, because when people feel they can let off steam, they are less likely to want to upset things too much. It is the different bullying groups, the extremists, religious or otherwise, who talk the loudest about "freedom" and constitutional right, and they are also the ones who are working the hardest to take that away from the general public.

So they make their money from Twitch and Patreon and merchandise, rather than YouTube ads. Sucks but you can't really force advertisers to give you money. While the first part is true what you omit is that if people can not monetize videos they won't make them. You can be the best bread maker in the world, but if nobody pays you to make bread you are out of business and working for someone else as a shoe maker. It's also a selective process.

The rest is mostly adblocked to begin with. Also I have seen relevant ads on other sites - where the site itself sold the ads, to advertisers directly related to the topic at hand (a recycling site posting banner ads of recycling companies).Those were not adblocked, in part for not being part of an ad network so they fell off the radar. Not intrusive and relevant ads, that's totally fine with me. So it sounds like Internet advertising has to go back to basics. Sites themselves selling ads to advertisers instead of pulling in random ads. Advertisers themselves looking for relevant places to show their ads, instead of having their ads plastered over random sites. At the same time those failing ad networks can stop their invasive tracking and profiling, as it's quite obvious that doesn't work either.

(AAP) Although technology has long affected the labor force, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are heightening concerns about automation replacing a growing number of occupations, including highly skilled or "knowledge-based" jobs. Self-driving technology may eliminate the need for taxi, Uber and truck drivers, algorithms are playing a growing role in journalism, robots are informing consumers as mall greeters, and medicine is adapting robotic surgery and artificial intelligence to detect cancer and heart conditions. Of 700 occupations in the United States, 47 percent are at "high risk" from automation, an Oxford University study concluded in 2013. A McKinsey study released this year offered a similar view, saying "about half" of activities in the world's workforce "could potentially be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies." Still, McKinsey researchers offered a caveat, saying that only around five percent of jobs can be "fully automated". A report by PwC this month concluded that around a third of jobs in the United States, Germany and Britain could be eliminated by automation by the early 2030s, with the losses concentrated in transportation, storage, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade. But experts have warned such studies may fail to grasp the full extent of the risks to the working population. "The studies are underestimating the impact of technology - some 80 to 90 percent of jobs will be eliminated in the next 10 to 15 years," said Vivek Wadhwa, a tech entrepreneur and faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley. "Artificial intelligence is moving a lot faster than anyone had expected," said Mr Wadhwa, who is co-author of a forthcoming book on the topic. "Alexa (Amazon's home hub) and Google Home are getting amazingly intelligent very fast. Microsoft and Google have demonstrated that AI can understand human speech better than humans can." Mr Wadhwa calls the driverless car a "metaphor" for the future of labor and a sign of a major shift. Warnings of dire social consequences from automation have also come from the likes of the physicist Stephen Hawking and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, among others. Hebrew University of Jerusalem historian Yuval Harari wrote in his 2017 book, "Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow", technology will lead to "superfluous people" as "intelligent non-conscious algorithms" improve. "As algorithms push humans out of the job market, wealth and power might become concentrated in the hands of the tiny elite that owns the all-powerful algorithms, creating unprecedented social and political inequality, Mr Harari wrote.  Mr Harari points to the Oxford study, estimating a high probability of job loss to automation - cashiers (97 percent), paralegals (94 percent), bakers (89 percent) and bartenders (77 percent), for example. Others disagree. Boston University economist and researcher James Bessen dismisses alarmist predictions, contending that advances in technology generally lead to more jobs, even if the nature of work changes. His research found that the proliferation of ATM machines did not decrease bank tellers' employment in recent decades, and that automation of textile mills in the 19th century led to an increase in weaving jobs because it created more demand. "Robots can replace humans in certain tasks but don't entirely replace humans," Mr Bessen said. But he acknowledged automation "is destroying a lot of low-skill, low wage jobs, and the new jobs being created need higher skills". Former president Barack Obama's council of economic advisors also warned last year that most jobs paying less than $20 an hour "would come under pressure from automation". Although the net impact of robots remains unclear, tech leaders and others are already debating how to deal with the potential job displacement. Microsoft founder Bill Gates said last month that he supports a "robot tax", an idea floated in Europe, including by a socialist presidential candidate in France. But Mr Bessen, a former fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center, said taxing robots could be counterproductive. "You don't want to be taxing the machines because they enable people to earn higher wages," he said. "If you tax machines, you will slow the beneficial side of the process." Peter Diamandis, chairman of the X Prize Foundation for technical innovation and founder of the Silicon Valley think-tank Singularity University, is among those calling for a "universal basic income" to compensate people for job losses. Offering income guarantees "will be one of many tools empowering self-actualization at scale", he said in a blog post, arguing that automation will allow people "to follow their passions, be more creative". But Mr Wadhwa said the problems run deeper and will require more creative solutions. "A basic income won't solve the social problems of joblessness because people's identity revolves around our jobs," he said. "Even if we have enough food and energy, we have to deal with the social disruption that's coming. We need a much broader discussion." Mr Bessen said reversing the trends of the past decades, where high-skilled jobs gain at the expense of others, pose a "big challenge." "It's entirely possible we can meet the challenge," he said. "But the evidence in the past 20 years is that things are moving in the wrong direction." © AFP 2017 Technology World TRENDING VIDEO Violence erupts at pro-Trump rally Trump supporters have clashed with protesters at a rally in California’s south.

Seeing as it's unlikely to be supplanted anytime soon, companies such as Google and Dropbox have been working hard to squeeze every last byte out of its compression abilities. For Dropbox, the solution was Lepton, delivering images 22 per cent smaller with no quality loss. Now Google has its own option — Guetzli. And you can try it yourself right now. Normally, you'd have to grab the Guetzli source from GitHub and compile it yourself. Fortunately, as gHacks' Martin Brinkmann discovered, a more user-friendly approach is available, via an application called FileOptimizer. Created by Javier Gutiérrez Chamorro, FileOptimizer supports a great many formats and encoding methods, including Guetzli. However, it's not enabled out of the box. Here's how to switch it on (courtesy of gHacks): 1. Open the fileoptimizer.ini file. You find it in the main user folder, e.g. C:\users\martin\fileoptimizer.ini 2. Locate the parameter JPEGAllowLossy, and set it to true. This is done by replacing false in the line with true, so that the beginning of the line reads JPEGAllowLossy=true 3. Restart FileOptimizer if it is running already. From his testing, Brinkmann found that Guetzli performed as advertised, reducing JPEGs by 20-30 per cent with no perceptible loss in quality. The bad news is, it takes forever to produce this result. So give it a whirl... but only if your PC has nothing better to do today.

Isn’t that amazing, the power of time travel with words. Also, it’s the only way that I can tell you funny things while at the same time doing those mommy tasks that need doing. Speaking of time travel, if you missed out on what happened this week, allow me to take you back in time with all the important stories. Best Stories If you’ve ever wandered around a shopping center parking lot looking for your car, I have some good news for you. Actually, Google does – Google Maps can now help you remember where you parked your car. Also, if you’re one of the very few people who own an Xbox One but never played Ryse or The Walking Dead: Season 2, you’re in luck as it seems they are coming to Xbox Live’s Games with Gold. The leaks have begun, y’all! Destiny 2 is coming, and this box art looks fake enough to be real. Worst Stories The Terminator will always be back, right? RIGHT? Well, apparently not anymore. At least, not with its enduring lead actor. Apple has revealed a sexy new red phone, but you know what sucks? The front is still white! Who does that? Don’t they know that black is best and the phone would be even more gorgeous (and a must by) with a black front? Truly, though, the worst story of the week is the fact that the internet mobs descended on a woman who worked on Mass Effect Andromeda. She was harassed and her integrity questioned all because of the sometime janky animations in the new game. Did none of these people play the original games and see those animations? More importantly, is normal human decency so completely dead? I hate stories like these. Random Stories I loved Mystery Science Theater 3000 when I watched it back in the day. It’s making a comeback on Netflix, and it’s… odd. But that’s what was always so delightful about the original. How long does it take to learn impressive fight choreography? 15 minutes, if you’re Finn Jones. Doctor Dolittle was never my thing. Talking animals just feel a little too silly for me, but of course it’s a popular film that’s due for a reboot. And who better to star in it than… Robert Downey Jr? Really? Um, okay. Reviews and features Mass Effect Andromeda review – a fantastic, fumbling fresh start Gaming legitimacy – The battle of Us vs Us Marvel’s Iron Fist season 1 review – A misguided and middling adaptation Power Rangers review – An unexpectedly good blockbuster reworking of the cheesy ’90s TV series Games shouldn’t be afraid to demand urgency from players Mass Effect: Andromeda – Romance and banging guide Nier Automata – Superb action and sublime storytelling Life Review – A tense sci-fi thriller with plenty of life Header Image of the Week Of course this wins. Well done, Darryn! Comment of the Week This week’s winner is Ottokie with his brilliant comment about Star Citizen: Schrodinger’s game. It exists but also does not exist. Bonus additional content For once, Darryn didn’t send me something from the dark reaches of the internet. Awww, too cute! Here is something else to think about this weekend. Also, good news for MMORPG console gaming fans… all five of you. Really, how “massive” can these be?

In the last week a host of heavyweight advertisers paused their ad campaigns because the search giant has been unable to guarantee that ads won't appear alongside unsavoury content like racist or extremist videos. First was the UK branch of Havas, which suspended its campaigns last Friday. They were quickly followed by a host of brands in the UK, including the BBC, Marks & Spencer, HSBC, McDonalds and the UK Government. AT&T was the first US brand to follow suit And in Ireland Core Media decided to pause all advertising with YouTube and the Google display network on Wednesday. "It's clear that Google needs a bit more time to find a comprehensive solution," said Core Media's chief digital and data officer, Justin Cullen on Wednesday. "This is a big problem and it's a problem to be solved by technology. "At the moment, certain parties are tampering with the metadata behind the videos that they're posting on their YouTube channel, which is getting around the algorithmic checks that Google has in place. Google is one of the most advanced technology and data science companies in the world. So if anyone can solve this particular problem, they can. We trust in them that they can do it. But for now, they need more time to find a solution." To date the solution Google's proposing has amounted to giving advertisers greater control over where their ads appear. Advertisers will be able to exclude specific sites and channels from all their AdWords for Video and Google Display Network campaigns. And there's a new default setting for campaigns that automatically excludes websites and videos that are deemed potentially objectionable. "We'll be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising," said Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler. "In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn't have been, we plan to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues. In addition, we'll soon be able to resolve these cases in less than a few hours." But to be fair to Google, it's not like it's been sitting on its hands up to this point. Last year the company claims to have removed nearly 1.7 billion bad ads, axed over 100,000 publishers from its AdSense programme and pulled ads from over 300 million YouTube videos. It also recently provided its army of quality raters (yes, Google has thousands of contractors worldwide who evaluate search results) with updated guidelines on upsetting and offensive content. Upsetting-offensive content includes anything that promotes hate or violence, contains graphic violence, or (and how's this for a broad definition) "other types of content which users in your locale would find extremely upsetting or offensive". But the problem really is broader than just Google. "There is a lot attention on YouTube in particular," says Cullen. "But the reality is, when you have an open source network -which is what the internet is - it highlights the need for controls to be put in place in terms of the dissemination of information. Traditional media owners are subjected to certain regulations and restrictions. Whereas technology companies they don't see themselves as media companies, and don't act in the same way to responsibly deliver content to consumers." With all this turmoil there's a potential upside for traditional media outlets, which could be pitching themselves as safe and trusted platforms Channel 4 was quickest off the block. It has released research that claimed ads on broadcasters' video on demand (VoD) channels were cheaper and more engaging than video ads on YouTube and Facebook. The TV station subjected viewers to eye-tracking and skin conductance analysis in their homes, and also tested implicit responses with 1,000 people. The results showed VoD ads garnered 3.5 times greater attention levels than ads on YouTube, and viewers typically watch these ads in a more attentive state. The research showed VoD ads are more likely to be watched from start to finish. Around 70pc of Facebook users were seen to actively scroll past video ads while 73pc of YouTube videos and ads were played in the background, while users did something else. So while brand safety may be the crux of the stand-off with advertisers, attention and visibility may be the real challenges the search giant needs to address.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Analyst Sees Little Impact as Google Advertisers Suspend YouTube Ads By Paul Ausick March 23, 2017 10:10 am EDT Print Email Tweet Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is caught in a bind between some major advertisers and some of the content creators it depends on to attract a younger audience. Telecom giants AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Verizon Inc. (NYSE: VZ) have both issued statements stating that they have suspended non-search advertising on Google’s YouTube because, AT&T said, their ads are appearing next to “YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate.” Verizon’s statement was similar: “Once we were notified that our ads were appearing on non-sanctioned websites, we took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement and launched an investigation.” Other advertisers, including the British government and pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, have also pulled advertising from YouTube. Mizuho Securities USA doesn’t expect much near-term damage from the advertisers’ actions: We believe that YouTube could generate approximately $12 billion+ in gross revenue this year. If 10% of revenue is impacted by this ban, we estimate that this would impact Non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.15 in 2017 (based on 65%/35% rev split, 30% [YouTube] operating margin and 19% tax rate). This would impact our 2017 non-GAAP EPS by less than 1%. However, if Google does not nip this issue in the bud, we think there could be a broader repercussions around YouTube’s brand, if consumers, creators and advertisers stop coming to the site. Google’s dilemma is meeting advertiser requirements on one hand, and, on the other, alienating content creators who attract relatively small numbers of viewers, but who also appeal to the younger demographic. In a comment cited by Recode, Google said: We don’t comment on individual customers but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands. Mizuho concludes its note by reiterating its Buy rating on Alphabet stock with the following comment: We like the fact that Alphabet continues to innovate around ads, and we see device bidding, expanded text ads, and Google Cloud as meaningful drivers of growth in 2017. While we view this [YouTube] ad issue as a near-term concern, we believe that Google is working hard to address the issues and win back the trust of its brand advertisers. Alphabet’s stock traded down about 1.8% Thursday morning, at $834.79 in a 52-week range of $672.66 to $874.69. The 12-month consensus price target is $987.88.

Now, the service is scheduled to hit the chopping block. But don't panic. 10 Tricks To Master Google Hangouts Google Hangouts has been available for almost three years now, and while it still has a few minor issues, it's still a slick and powerful messaging platform that works almost anywhere. Dig a little deeper into the Google Hangouts app, and you'll find a bunch of features you might not yet have come across, from secret codes to floating chat heads — here are our favourites. Read more Gchat wasn't really a name that Google officially used for its messaging service. The chat client was really known as Google Talk and on June 26 it will cease to exist. It will now be replaced by Google Hangouts, a move that's been years in the making and makes a great deal of sense considering that Hangouts can handle Gchat functionality. Google hasn't just been doubling up on messaging services. It currently owns Allo, Android Messages, Duo, Hangouts, Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger and Voice. In the extremely crowded field of messaging apps, Gchat was generally beloved or simply considered innocuous. It just worked, it was already in your email and it had the option to not log your messages. That last feature meant it was used in offices across the country to talk smack about bosses and co-workers on a regular basis. Not everyone was a fan of the dying service. The Electronic Freedom Foundation criticised Google for dropping support of the open XMPP standard back in 2014. The company integrated Talk with its proprietary Hangouts and now that service will be integrated into Gmail. According to the search giant, contacts should migrate over and not a whole lot will change. Some might be sad that they aren't technically using "Gchat" anymore but most will probably just keep calling it that. The biggest change is that the Google Talk for Android app will no longer function. Google Hangouts will also be losing SMS support. It will be added to Android Messages which is scheduled to receive features like, "read receipts, group chat, hi-res photo sharing and more," sometime in the near future. In 2015, the Electronic Freedom Foundation gave Hangouts a two out of seven on its "Secure Messaging Scorecard." But there are a million ways to message these days and it seems that if absolute security is what you're looking for at the moment, Signal is the reigning king.

But rather than find herself the target of one of the president’s sharply worded tweets, the combative Dane, who last year slapped a 13 billion-euro ($14 billion) tax order on Apple Inc., is more likely to find herself in an antitrust twilight zone because Trump, who’s vowed to put America first, has yet to appoint top-level competition officials. Margrethe Vestager Photographer: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg Vestager told reporters last week she’s still in the dark about how many officials at the U.S. Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission she’d see during her short U.S. trip. Such meetings are a usual part of a careful co-operation between the U.S. and the EU as officials try to align deadlines for merger reviews and coordinate global cartel raids. Her visit comes months after she disregarded calls from the then President Barack Obama’s U.S. Treasury to avoid slapping Apple for its tax arrangements. While the EU and the U.S. antitrust authorities have often worked closely together, including to oppose a $28 billion oil-services merger last year, they’ve also clashed in the past on whether deals should be cleared or blocked. Nicolas Veron, a researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Europe is up against a potentially “destructive U.S. administration that’s willing to question very long standing positions of the U.S. government.” European regulators like Vestager must proceed with "extreme caution" in how to handle their opposite numbers in the U.S. Brussels ‘Hellhole’ The new U.S. administration has also undermined aspects of the trans-Atlantic relationship, with Trump having questioned the U.S. commitment to NATO, predicted other countries would follow the U.K. out of the bloc and even called Europe’s de facto capital, Brussels, a hellhole. Vestager also faces a White House that’s pledged to tear down regulations in a bid to promote more business activity. The former Danish economy minister will speak to almost 3,000 lawyers and officials at the American Bar Association, a key event in the antitrust world. She’s scheduled to speak at the event’s March 31  roundtable alongside the U.S. Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for antitrust, a position that hasn’t yet been filled. “It’s so early days that if they are confirmed by the time I get there it’s too early for us to meet,” she said on Wednesday. Her office said Friday that no meetings had yet been confirmed for her. Trump’s Pick The Justice Department’s antitrust division and the FTC, which share antitrust jurisdiction in the U.S., are both being run by temporary leaders until Trump names permanent replacements. Makan Delrahim, a former Justice Department lawyer now at the White House, is Trump’s pick to run the antitrust division, according to people familiar with the matter. Delrahim’s nomination requires Senate approval before he can step into the job. Antitrust, a policy spearheaded by the U.S. to rein in 19th century railroad and banking monopolies, is championed enthusiastically by the Brussels-based European Commission. Vestager said she works to keep markets open and to foster competition, basing her decisions on evidence and the law. This could see some conflict with a U.S. administration that is determined to favor American business over foreigners. “There are embers that are there that are glowing,” said Bill Kovacic, a professor at Georgetown Law and a former FTC Commissioner, of the EU-U.S. antitrust relationship. “There’s an unhappy recent track record of playing with fire in that area.” ‘Very Hostile’ The U.S. Treasury’s paper on the EU’s Apple case, sent by the previous administration, was “a very hostile memo. It was not so politely saying ‘you don’t know what you’re talking about, you can’t even do your own job properly,”’ he said. Aside from Apple, Vestager is spearheading a number of probes into American companies, including three at an advanced stage for Google, two for Qualcomm Inc. and one for Mastercard Inc. She’s weighing a complaint from airlines over aftermarket contracts from Boeing Co. and Airbus SE and investigating possible cartels between global banks over financial benchmarks, including in foreign exchange markets. U.S. Companies The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up The EU’s controversial investigations into tax rulings granted by European companies have overwhelmingly hit U.S. companies, with back-tax orders already issued to Apple and Starbucks Corp., with probes into Amazon.com Inc. and McDonald’s underway. EU officials argue that these tax structures are mostly used by multinationals, many of which are American, and that they are also probing two European firms. Still, Vestager seems to have avoided harsh enforcement for U.S. companies in recent months. She’s focused on fining European and Asian airlines, car-part manufacturers and car battery recyclers. The one American target under investigation that she’s moved on has been Amazon, which is working on a settlement that would allow it avoid fines. She approved a mega-merger between U.S. agricultural chemical giants Dow Chemical Co. and DuPont Co. on Monday after wresting tough concessions to overcome EU concerns that the deal could have harmed innovation. The EU had "very close contact with the case team of the Department of Justice all along to compare notes on this case," she said. Vestager insists that she’s neutral and that she doesn’t see “that the flag or the nationality of the company plays a role,” she told Bloomberg TV earlier this month. Even if the U.S. doesn’t take issue with EU antitrust enforcement, a cooling of what was once a close relationship might hold back regulators’ work. EU merger officials work closely and even rely on U.S. counterparts to examine how companies work and build cases on how a deal might be harmful. The EU’s handful of people working the Halliburton Co.-Baker Hughes Inc. merger probe was outnumbered by nearly two dozen U.S. officials. EU regulators "very much appreciate the concrete cooperation we have on a case-by-case basis" with the U.S. and "work very closely with U.S. teams on mergers," Vestager said in the interview. "That working relationship is very precious to us." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Guest 21 bot experts make their predictions for 2017 Adelyn Zhou, Topbots@adelynzhou March 25, 2017 4:41 PM Tags: 2017 predictions, Amir Shevat, andy mauro, Ben Parr, bot, bots, chatbot, chatbots, Dennis Yang, Jeff Pulver, jordi torras, marlene jia, matthew hartman, Oren Jacob, predictions, rachel law, Zor Gorelov Image Credit: Shutter_M 2016 was a huge year for bots, with major platforms like Facebook launching bots for Messenger, and Amazon and Google heavily pushing their digital assistants. Looking forward to 2017, we asked 21 bot experts, entrepreneurs, and executives to share their predictions for how bots will continue to evolve in the coming year. 1. Andy Mauro, CEO, Automat “In 2017, brands will realize that conversational marketing is a better way to learn about and build relationships with their customer than today’s digital marketing, which monitors their customers with cookies, pixels, search, and social data. We’ll also see powerful case study data showing that opt-in and conversion rates and the quality of profile information that can be obtained conversationally far outweighs the benefits of email marketing, marketing automation, and apps.” 2. Tania McCormack, director of product management, Flowdock “Bots will be even more helpful, more intuitive, and most of all, more human. In Flowdock, we aim to have our users interact with bots like we do the people around us to get the information and updates we need. Best of all, bots will continue to keep work fun and to make us laugh.” 3. David Mendlewicz, cofounder, Butterfly “We’re going to see more and more instances of bots helping us develop and grow as humans. To date, bots are primarily seen as a novel utility — a way to get things done more quickly or grasp information more immediately. Moving forward, the machine genius of bots will help understand our learning gaps and fill them in with relevant, personalized information that’s rooted in real data. In other words, bots will be a boon for education.” 4. Ben Parr, CMO and cofounder, Octane AI “There will be an explosion of unique content and experiences from bots as the barrier to creating and managing them drops. This will lead to some breakout bots. Some people will be famous primarily for their bots.” 5. Justin Vandehey, founder, Growbot “In 2017, I think we’re going to see bots grow up a bit, both in terms of standards for how they should be built and how they should be used. There’s a finite set of core workflows and jobs that can be improved. Bot builders who identify those workflows and fit in without requiring a ton of behavior change…those are the money bots.” 6. Jordi Torras, founder and CEO, Inbenta “Chatbots will get increasingly smarter, thanks to the adoption of sophisticated AI algorithms and machine learning. But also they will specialize more in specific tasks, like online purchases, customer support, or online advice. First attempts of chatbot interoperability will start to appear, with generalist chatbots, like Siri or Alexa, connecting to specialized enterprise chatbots to accomplish specific tasks. Functions traditionally performed by search engines will be increasingly performed by chatbots.” 7. Dan Reich, CEO and cofounder, Troops “The word ‘bots’ will slowly go away as people realize that the value is less about talking to a computer or bot, and more about having intelligent workflow within a conversational platform.” 8. Dmitriy Kachin, head of partnerships, Chatfuel “AI technology — once the machine learning aspect of the current AI engines moves on to the next level and the NLP functionality becomes more sophisticated, we should see some really interesting breakthroughs in terms of chatbot experiences that will appear as a result of that. Ecommerce — when the ability to monetize your bot becomes more robust with solutions integrating CRM systems, warehouse management systems, order tracking, etc. — there will be a lot more motivation to realize your offering in a chatbot form. The resulting increase in various ecommerce use cases and the corresponding user traffic should be interesting to watch. As a result, we’ll see overall wider adoption of bots.” 9. Rob May, CEO and cofounder, Talla “This year, we’ll finally see large enterprises adopting chat. In our own lead flow at Talla we’ve seen that Fortune 1000s are exploring platforms and what they can do with them. This is how people want to work — and they’re seeing the vision too. We’re at the tipping point where they’re starting to cross over. As a result, we’ll see the integration ecosystem continue to mature into more robust solutions.” 10. Lauren Kunze, CEO, Pandorabots, Inc. “Right now the industry needs data driven success stories as an antidote to hype, and this year certain bot applications will increasingly yield real business results. This will help brands filter the noise and differentiate upstarts from industry leaders. Beyond 2017, I predict bots will be the primary interface for casual interactions between people and brands, and people and connected things.” 11. Amir Shevat, head of developer relations, Slack “We will see conversational interfaces facilitating productive business workflows. We will see bots augment our life experiences in text and voice in consumer use cases.” 12. Mikhail Naumov, cofounder and CSO, DigitalGenius “In 2017, brands will understand when to use scripted chatbots and when to use machine learning algorithms. Customer service functions in particular will be significantly transformed with the latest advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence. Human and machine intelligence will be combined in a seamless way to make great experiences for customers.” 13. Zor Gorelov, CEO and cofounder, Kasisto, Inc. “We expect the bot landscape to expand in three key areas: monetization, security, and overall growth in capabilities. A marketplace on popular platforms will enable discovery and in-app transactions. This will drive a higher standard for security, especially in privacy-centric industries like banking, insurance, or healthcare. The more companies and players in the space, the faster the bots will improve and the more useful they will become.” 14. Marlene Jia, CRO, TOPBOTS “Bots will be built with specific use cases and objectives in mind, driving actual adoption of the consumer.. 2016 was a year of experimentation for both the brands and users, and there were a lot of learnings that emerged. In 2017, you’ll see brands and bot creators doing a better job identifying the use case for the bot and the narrow goals of what the bot should be able to do. We can’t guarantee AI will be at the stage it needs to be to make bots intelligent enough, but what we can do is have a clear idea of what the bot should do and design it based on that objective.” 15. Matthew Hartman, partner, Betaworks “We will start to see a set of bots that are growing, solving the discovery problem in unique ways. We’ll also start to see messaging services experiment with monetization that feels native and unique.” 16. Oren Jacob, CEO, PullString “We will see Alexa voice experiences grow substantially in usage, reach, and complexity. A lot of amazing things are being built for the Alexa platform.” 17. Jeff Pulver, founder, MoNage “The way we experience the internet is changing, and that the result of the shift in how communication evolves will be highly disruptive. We are now at a major inflection point for which there will be no turning back and from which we are likely to see the way we use the internet change. Apps may start to disappear over time. Websites will be less needed; the information shared on websites will be stored in the Cloud and accessed by services that need it. Communications will happen on our behalf and information will be presented in a way more in tune with how we process and share information once we search for it ourselves. Communications will be better, easier, and more relevant for us internet users as a result of AI. Furthermore, this change will make life better for our personal and business connections, implying new business opportunities and models to explore. Summing up the change, the interface between humans and computers is rapidly changing from an ‘operational’ interface (websites, apps) to a ‘conversational’ interface (chatbots, voice interfaces). This is revolutionary, given that the ‘operational’ interface has been the standard way to interact with computers since the earliest computers came on the market. In order for this fundamental shift to happen, there is a lot of work to be done.” 18. Dennis Yang, cofounder and CPO, Dashbot “We are already seeing continued strong growth in the bot space across all platforms for the first part of 2017. I predict we will see a number of bots hit one million DAU by the end of 2017. Furthermore, we will begin to see more bots that fully embrace the capabilities of conversational UIs, differentiating themselves from the web and mobile experiences to which we are currently accustomed.” 19. Tom Hadfield, CEO, Message.io “2017 will be the year of the conversational workplace. With the launch of Slack Enterprise Grid, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts Chat, and Workplace by Facebook all in the first four months of the year, the enterprise messaging space is proving to be where bots are finding mainstream adoption. 2017 will be the year that conversational interfaces begin to transform the $620 billion enterprise software industry, just as the graphical user interface did in the ’80’s, the web did in the ’90’s, and mobile apps did more recently.” 20. Sandeep Chivukula, cofounder, Botmetrics “More push, less pull. Today bots react to customers. The best bots of 2017 will predict what’s important to customers and help them take action.” 21. Rachel Law, CEO and founder, Kip “The line between software bots and robots and drones will blur as physical bots integrate into platforms. Soon you’ll be able to control Roombas and drones through Messenger!” Above: VB Profiles Chatbots Landscape.

As part of a broader effort to treat internet service providers and telecoms operators as utility companies, Obama imposed restrictions on what these companies could do with all the user data from browsers and apps. Emboldened by Trump, the Republicans have just allowed these businesses to collect, sell and manipulate such data without user permission. From the short-sighted domestic perspective, it seems like a boon to the likes of Verizon and AT&T, especially as they increasingly find themselves confronting their data-rich counterparts in Silicon Valley. Telecoms companies have been complaining (not entirely without reason) that the Obama administration favoured the interests of Google and Facebook which, invoking the lofty rhetoric of “keeping the internet free” only to defend their own business agenda, have traditionally faced somewhat lighter regulation. The Democrats, always happy to attack Trump, have jumped on the issue, warning that the Senate vote would foster ubiquitous and extensive surveillance by the telecoms industry – and Silicon Valley, of course, would never commit such sins. Under the new rules, complained Bill Nelson, a senator from Florida, “your broadband provider may know more about your health – and your reaction to illness – than you are willing to share with your doctor”. Never mind that Google and Facebook already know all this – and much more – and generate little outrage from the Democrats. The Democrats, of course, only have themselves to blame for such ineptitude. From the early 1980s onwards, centre-left movements on both sides of the Atlantic no longer discussed technology policy in terms of justice, fairness or inequality. Instead, they preferred to emulate their neoliberal opponents and frame choices – about technology policy, but also about many other domains – in terms of just one goal that rules supreme above all other: innovation. The problem with building a political programme on such flimsy economistic foundations is that it immediately opens the door to competing narratives of just what kind of policy produces more innovation. Within this debate, the entire history of the internet – a fluid and borderless object that can include everything from mainframe computers to software that powers servers – becomes an extremely contentious theme that, depending on how one slices and dices this very “internet”, can bolster demands for both greater regulation and greater deregulation of digital technologies. Whatever Trump’s proclaimed departures from the deadening orthodoxy of the Republican party, he shares its bizarre view – endorsed and promoted by Fox News and a new breed of savvy media enterprises, such as Breitbart – that the Democrats are just a bunch of closeted socialists who invoke the highfalutin rhetoric of “human rights” or “humanitarianism” to disguise their real radical agenda. This piercing insight doesn’t prevent Trump from also attacking Hillary Clinton and her lieutenants as being in the pay of Wall Street and Goldman Sachs: apparently, this is where ardent socialists plan the revolution these days. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A rare photograph showing Donald Trump using a computer. From the Twitter account of Kellyanne Conway, November 2016 Photograph: @KellyannePolls However, even a cursory analysis of both Bill Clinton and Obama’s global cheerleading for American businesses during the past two decades would reveal them to possess a set of remarkably robust capitalist instincts. From treaties such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or the Trade in Services Agreement, to the close collaboration between the US Chamber of Congress and the Department of Commerce in pushing the country’s latest technological exports (such as “smart city” technologies sold by Microsoft, Cisco, or IBM), the Democrats have long embraced “America’s capital first” as their motto. In this, they were not so different from the Republicans of the pre-Trump era. And yet, what Trump and the likes of John Bolton – who represent the unashamedly unilateralist, unhinged wing of the Republican party – take to be the Democrats’ poisonous mix of socialism and humanitarianism is often just a banal mix of capitalism and pseudo-humanitarianism. It is precisely through constant rhetorical appeals to the universalism of the “global village” that Washington has traditionally justified its economic expansionism – a tactic at work since the days of Woodrow Wilson and hardly an invention of Clinton or Obama. Whatever its theoretical merits, multilateralism as practised by America has always meant “multi-markets” first – and all the rhetorical flourishes second. Sometimes this rhetoric worked, sometimes it didn’t. But it still required some legitimising in the global arena. So every now and then, Washington had to play nice, rein in its own plutocrats, and make sure that their pillaging of the domestic population didn’t completely undermine the image of prosperity and freedom that underlined America’s dominance abroad. Obama didn’t much deviate from that script. For example, when the Snowden revelations took place, his administration didn’t simply say, “We’re an empire, we run everyone’s communications, so get on with it”, as, say, the preceding Bush administration might have done. Rather, Obama’s did its utmost to deny that any excessive and authorised surveillance was happening. There was some logic to it. Who would trust America’s tech companies otherwise? Why would government institutions in Germany, Russia or China agree to store their sensitive documents on servers there? Obama’s reassuring answer: US intentions were good and it’s to be trusted. And didn’t Obama do his best to defend net neutrality anyway? Any effort to pierce this rhetorical bubble – by pointing out, for example, that restrictions on the free flow of data did not imply restrictions on the freedom of expression but, rather, should be seen as (protectionist) trade instruments, or that there’s a good case to be made for not surrendering a country’s technological sovereignty if one doesn’t want to end up living under Silicon Valley’s neo-colonial regime – was immediately dismissed as reactionary and authoritarian, usually by the same army of Washington thinktanks with close ties to Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Goaded by the domestic telecoms industry, with little exposure to global markets, Trump may have done more to rekindle the debate about technological sovereignty than all the critics of America’s tech expansionism combined. While in the short-term, one can imagine how deregulating America’s telecoms will yield short-term gains, it’s hard to imagine how the practices it will permit – including hijacking of our search queries and internet traffic to show more ads and, potentially, infect our devices with malware – could be reconciled with the vision of a heavily Americanised global internet that is voluntarily agreed to by all the parties involved. It is this unwarranted trust in the Americanised internet that has underpinned the immense growth of one truly healthy sector of the US economy – technology. Well, goodbye to all that: the era of the Americanised internet is over. Obama could always speak about the need to promote “internet freedom” in authoritarian states, even as he oversaw the most sophisticated surveillance programme in history. The tech sector kept expanding, entering even more foreign markets. Trump, on the other hand, has no lofty rhetoric to fall back on and the deregulation agenda pursued by the Republicans will alienate whatever international allies he might have kept otherwise. Make America great again by eliminating America’s hegemony over the global internet: try that for a rousing slogan.

Credit: James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock Ben Riley-Smith, Assistant Political Editor Robert Mendick, Chief Reporter Nicola Harley 26 March 2017 • 12:01am Amber Rudd has named social ­media companies as she demands more action to tackle online terror and help in fighting radicalisation The Home Secretary picks out the little-known websites Telegram, ­Wordpress and Justpaste.it as she ­widens the Government’s criticism of internet firms. In an exclusive Telegraph ­article she reveals Google, Twitter and Facebook bosses have been summoned to a meeting to discuss ­action over extremism. She also hints that new proposals to make internet giants take down hate videos quicker will be included in a counter-terrorism strategy due within weeks. Watch | Amber Rudd accuses WhatsApp of giving terrorists 'a secret place to hide' 00:20 It comes after a terror attack saw Adrian Ajao kill four people and ­injure dozens more by mowing down tourists on Westminster Bridge and storming Parliament. “Each attack confirms again the role that the internet is playing in serving as a conduit, inciting and inspiring ­violence, and spreading extremist ­ideology of all kinds,” she writes. “But we can’t tackle it by ourselves … We need [social media companies] to take a more proactive and leading role in tackling the terrorist abuse of their platforms.” Scotland Yard said last night that Ajao’s murderous onslaught lasted just 82 seconds.  Adrian Ajao killed four people and injured more than 40 in a terror attack on Westminster. The Metropolitan Police issued a timeline, showing the attack ­began at eight seconds past 2.40pm and that Ajao was shot at 30 seconds past 2.41pm. With police investigations ongoing, the Telegraph has ­uncovered more details about what turned British-born Ajao into a killer. The 52-year-old once tried to run a woman down in his local village by mounting the pavement in his car, this newspaper has been told. It has also emerged that Ajao lived within a mile of members of a terrorist cell convicted of attempting to blow up a Territorial Army base in Luton when he lived there. Members of public and police officers pay their respects to the victims of Westminster terror attack in Parliament Square. Credit: Tolga Akmen/LNP On Saturday Tobias Ellwood, the hero MP who tried to save the life of Pc Keith Palmer minutes after the attack, revealed his “heartbreak” at the ­officer’s death. “I’m deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the messages of support, especially from the policing fraternity, which I now realise is as close knit as the military’s in supporting its own,” he said in a statement. “I played only a small part that day, doing what I was taught to do, and am honoured to have been invited to join the Privy Council afterwards. It is right that we concentrate our thoughts on the victims as we stand side by side to protect all that we hold dear, including our precious values and way of life which will always prevail.” Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood (centre) helps emergency services attend to a police officer outside the Palace of Westminster, London, after a policeman was stabbed.  Credit: PA It has been announced that Pc Palmer will be remembered ­permanently for his bravery at the ­National Memorial Arboretum. The 48-year-old husband and father will be commemorated at the UK Police Memorial at the site in Staffordshire. Eleven people were arrested as police investigate the attack and a number of addresses raided across London, Birmingham and elsewhere.  All but one – a 58-year-old arrested in Birmingham – have been released from custody. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, who is the Senior National ­Coordinator for UK Counter Terrorism Policing, said yesterday that Ajao is ­believed to have “acted alone”. He added: “We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never ­understand why he did this.  “That ­understanding may have died with him.” Candle lights on Westminster Bridge, London, after the terror attack Credit: PA Ms Rudd writes in this newspaper: “We need the help of social media ­companies: the Googles, the Twitters, the Facebooks, of this world.  “And the smaller ones, too – ­platforms like Telegram, Wordpress and Justpaste.it”  The three smaller companies named are little known to most Britons but have become a focus of concern within the Home Office. Government sources said that while the issues of extremists’ posts on ­Facebook and Google were well known, smaller internet firms were also facing the same challenges. Telegram is a messaging service not dissimilar to mobile phone texting with 100 million active monthly users. JustPaste.it is a free service which ­allows users to share text, images and video, while Wordpress.com is a free website publishing and hosting ­system. A police officer stands in front of armoured police personnel carriers on a street leading to the Houses of Parliament. Credit: AFP/AFP David Ibsen, who is executive ­director of the Counter Extremism ­Project, a New York think tank which combats online extremism, warned that the battle against jihadi groups would increasingly be fought on the ­internet. He told The Sunday Telegraph: “Online channels are key to jihadi ­movements. The growth of Isil was ­accompanied by directing attacks through modern communications channels, or inspiring attacks by ­modern communications channels.” He said extremist groups used ­programs like Wordpress to build sites to publicise their cause and ­achievements, while using encrypted communications channels like ­Telegram either to plan attacks, or to coordinate publicity for attacks after the fact. He said: “As the territory of Islamic State shrinks, they’re going to rely more and more on their use of these modern communication tools to carry out their aims.” Watch | Tech expert: Amber Rudd raises concerns over encrypted messaging services 01:21 TELEGRAM What is it? Telegram is a messaging service used by 100 million active users a month. It works like mobile phone texting, but users can use Telegram from computers as well as phones and can send files, videos and pictures as well as text. After creating an account by providing their phone number users can anonymously message each other, message groups of up to 5000, or create ‘channels’ which broadcast publicly to larger audiences. In addition to standard encryption Telegram has ultra-secure “secret chats,” which can only be accessed from the two devices involved and leave no trace on the company’s servers. Users can even instruct messages and content to self-destruct, meaning even should a third party (or security services) access the phone, messages will no longer be there. Why is it linked to terror? Telegram’s security, and commitment to privacy, has led to it being called the messaging app-of-choice for jihadis. In December, Washington think tank the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) said: “It has surpassed Twitter as the most important platform,” adding, “We see ISIS talking about the benefits of Telegram and encouraging its followers to use it.” MEMRI director Steve Stalinsky told the Washington Times: “Just about every second of the day, a jihadi is posting something new on Telegram.” Last year ISIL used a Telegram channel to instruct would-be terrorists to prepare a “Christmas gift for the filthy pigs/apes” and the group took to Telegram to claim credit for the lorry attack which killed 12 in a Berlin Christmas market. Who runs it? Telegram was created by Russian tech entrepreneurs Pavel and Nikolai Durov, brothers who founded popular Russian social media network VK. It is registered at Companies House in the UK with two listed ‘members’ - Dogged Labs Ltd, registered in the British Virgin Islands and Telegraph Inc, registered in Belize. It claims Berlin as an international HQ. In February 2016, Pavel Durov told TechCrunch magazine: “Privacy, ultimately, is more important than our fear of bad things happening, like terrorism.” WORDPRESS.COM What is it? Uunlike Telegram Wordpress is not a mobile phone messenger but a free website publishing and hosting system. Wordpress software supports more than 60 million websites from personal blogs to major newspapers, and the free hosting site Wordpress.com hosts approximately 40 per cent of the world’s blogging sites. To create a Wordpress.com account, users log in with an email address, which they could have created anonymously. They do not need to provide a phone number. Once users have picked an available web address and chosen a basic website template, the new site will appear online. Why is it linked to terror? Its low cost, ease of use, and anonymous interface means terror groups are as likely as the average website owner to create their sites using Wordpress.com - for propaganda, radicalisation or publicity. It is possible to secure and encrypt a Wordpress site’s server so content cannot be hacked, and to share an encryption key with others so content can be shared privately. But most such sites are publicly available and used to spread content. According to US think tank the Counter Extremism Project, Wordpress.com sites have played host to beheading videos, firing squads, and a video of a man being shot in the head, emblazoned with the words This In the Enemy Of Allah. Who runs it? The Wordpress project was co-founded in 2003 by two developers, American Matt Mullenweg, 33, and Briton Mike Little, 54. Mullenweg’s company Automattic owns Wordpress.com which acts as web host for the majority of smaller Wordpress sites. Automattic was valued at over $1bn in its latest funding round. Little, who lives in Stockport, developed the original Wordpress software alongside Mullenweg but has gone on to focus on other development projects rather than on the Wordpress.com web hosting business. JUSTPASTE.IT What is it? More than six million people worldwide use social media site JustPaste.it to provide a simple and anonymous way of uploading content to the web. Users can write or paste text, images, or web code into the online program, without registering or providing a phone number or email address. Content is uploaded instantly to a web address to which they can direct others. The site has no search function so page addresses must be publicised elsewhere (eg Twitter) and its simplicity means it runs extremely quickly even where internet connections are very slow. It boasts “secure content publishing that even NSA [the US National Security Agency] won't be able to break” but its encryption methods for non-Premium users are no more elaborate than the average online shopping site - its appeal is in total user anonymity. Why is it linked to terror? Through 2014 and 2015 Jihadi groups including ISIL shared photos and videos on JustPasteIt including beheadings and prisoner massacres.   Last year jihadi extremists used the site to circulate the names, home addresses and photographs of 76 United States Air Force personnel on the site. In December 2016 MEMRI director Steven Stalinsky wrote: “For some time now, Justpaste.it has been the most important content-sharing website for jihadis” Who runs it? JustPaste.It was created, and is still managed, by Mariusz Żurawek, 28, from his home in Poland. Following a request from the Metropolitan Police in August 2014, Zurawek claims to have removed more than 2,000 ISIL posts despite the force’s lack of jurisdiction in Poland. But he has also defended the site’s “no registration” policy. In December 2015 Zurawek said in an interview with online magazine Host Advice: “Surprisingly, I found that the bad publicity also created a positive impact and attention to the site that made other people start using it for good causes.” Share this article Follow Telegraph News Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram READ MORE ABOUT: Extremism Facebook Google Twitter London attack Amber Rudd Terrorism Show more Galleries Gallery 28 Mar 2017, 6:31pm Gallery: Telegraph cartoons, March 2017 Premium Gallery 28 Mar 2017, 5:24pm Gallery: Matt cartoons, March 2017 Premium Gallery 28 Mar 2017, 1:20pm Gallery: Mission impossible: Abandoned Soviet space rocket in derelict hanger, in pictures News latest 28 Mar 2017, 8:40pm Donald Trump's border wall faces battle in Congress as White House unveils plan for $18 billion cuts in medical research and infrastructure to pay for it 00:28 28 Mar 2017, 8:26pm Disgruntled passenger obstructs path of Putney bus for 20 minutes 28 Mar 2017, 7:34pm MPs who fail to declare outside interests should be treated like criminals, Westminster committee warns 28 Mar 2017, 7:17pm Samsung store suffers fire mishap a day before Galaxy S8 launch  28 Mar 2017, 7:01pm Major restaurants installing music systems which make you spend 10pc more  28 Mar 2017, 6:51pm Comment: Generation Putin has been betrayed by the scale of corruption in Russia Con Coughlin Premium 28 Mar 2017, 6:49pm Israel warns its citizens to get out of Sharm el-Sheikh and Red Sea amid fears of terror attack on tourists 28 Mar 2017, 6:44pm Pioneering heart surgeon denies rape and sexual assault at hospital 28 Mar 2017, 6:43pm Comment: The Article 50 negotiations are going to be a roller-coaster.

Fresh after adding shareable bucket lists and parking reminders, Maps can now share your location in real time as well. It’s a pretty nifty implementation. Open the side menu or tap on the blue dot indicating where you are, and you’ll see a new “Share location” option. Pick a few people to share with, and they’ll be able to see where you are in real time right on their own Maps app. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY You can set your location to be shared permanently with certain people, or set a time limit. You can also share your progress while navigating, and have the option to send your location as a link in messaging apps, too. It’s one of the more genuinely useful features Google has added of late. There are several uses that I can already think of: Checking to make sure your friend arrived home safe after a late night out You’re visiting town for a couple of days, and want to let your friends know what you’re up to without having to constantly update them on your location Making sure no one gets lost when traveling in large groups Here’s Google’s own explainer: Granted, those are things you could previously do with third-party apps – and Apple has Find My Friends – but having it built into the most popular maps app around is certainly convenient. Location sharing is rolling out worldwide “soon” and is coming to Android, iPhone, and the mobile and desktop web apps.

The feature is rolling out first in Brazil, where Google announced the update at a São Paulo event; it’ll become available elsewhere in the world in the coming days. Unfortunately, I can’t say I’m excited about it at this point. I already use WhatsApp for most of my essential messaging and calls these days, and I don’t see the need to invite my contacts to try another app. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE Of course, I’m biased because I started on WhatsApp a long time ago, and that may not be the case for other smartphone users who get started with other messaging services, depending on where they are in the world, what’s popular there and which apps come preinstalled on their devices (Duo is now a default app on my Android 7.0-based Xiaomi Mi 5, and I can’t uninstall it). Even so, Duo isn’t a particularly enticing app at this point; a vast majority of my contacts aren’t on it yet, which means I’ll need to first send them a message to download it before we can use it. Its spartan interface leaves offers little reason to fiddle with the app, unlike its rivals. With WhatsApp, for example, I can check out people’s photo and video statuses, see what my friends have been rambling on about in group chats and pick up the thread in past conversations. That doesn’t mean that Duo needs to become bloated with unnecessary features – but its functionality also doesn’t warrant a standalone app. We wrote last August about how Duo should be folded into Hangouts, and that idea still makes sense today. Google could even go a further and bake its Allo messaging app into Hangouts, making it smarter by way of the built-in AI-powered Assistant. I’d have considered using Duo if other options didn’t cut it – but they do, and as a result, Duo feels like an also-ran, or just a part of an app that Google is still figuring out. The same could be said for Allo: it’s just added the ability to share files (documents, PDFs, Android APKs, zip files and MP3s, for example) in conversations, while other apps with significantly larger user bases have had this for ages. For reference, Allo is yet to cross even 50 million downloads on Google Play since it released half a year ago, while WhatsApp has crossed 1.2 billion users this year. While clever features like Allo’s smart replies are nice to have, they simply aren’t enough to build a large user base quickly. But if Google can tightly integrate its messaging service with the rest of its products and the Android UI without making it feel like another app to get used to, the company might have a shot in the messaging app wars. If you’re still keen on giving Duo a go, you can grab the app from Google Play and the App Store for free.
