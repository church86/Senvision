The Linux Foundation Although it is true that microservices follow the UNIX philosophy of writing short compact programs that do one thing and do it well, and that they bring a lot of advantages to a framework (e.g., continuous deployment, decentralization, scalability, polyglot development, maintainability, robustness, security, etc.), getting thousands of microservices up and running on a cluster and correctly communicating with each other and the outside world is challenging. In this talk from Node.js Interactive, Sandeep Dinesh -- a Developer Advocate at Google Cloud -- describes how you can successfully deploy microservices to a cluster using technologies that Google developed: Kubernetes and gRPC. To address the issues mentioned above, Google first developed Borg and Stubby. Borg was Google's internal schedule manager. When Google decided to use containers 10 years ago, this was a new field, so they wrote their own stuff. Borg ended up scheduling every single application at Google, from small side projects to Google Search. Stubby, Google’s RPC framework, was used for communication between different services. However, instead of putting Borg and Stubby on GitHub as open source projects, Google chose to write new frameworks from scratch in the open, with the open source community. The reason for this is that both Borg and Stubby were terribly written, according to Dinesh, and they were so tied to the Google's internal infrastructure as to be unusable by the outside world. That is how Kubernetes, the successor of Borg, and gRPC, a saner incarnation of Stubby, came to be. Kubernetes A common scenario while developing a microservice is to have your Docker container running your code on your local machine. Everything is fine until it is time to put it into production and you want to deploy your service on a cluster. That's when complications arise: You have to ssh into a machine, run Docker, keep it up with nohup, etc., all of which is complicated and error-prone. The only thing you gain, according to Dinesh, is that you have made your development a little bit easier. Kubernetes offers a solution in that it manages and orchestrates the containers on the cluster for you. You do not have to deal with machines anymore. Instead you interact with the cluster and the Kubernetes API. It works like this: You dockerize your app and pass it on to Kubernetes in what's called a Replication Controller. You tell Kubernetes that you need, say, four instances of your dockerized app running at the same time, and Kubernetes manages everything automatically. You don't have to worry about on which machines your apps run. If one instance of your microservices crashes, Kubernetes will spin it back up. If a node in the cluster goes offline, Kubernetes automatically distributes the work to other nodes. With random pods and containers spinning up on random computers, you need a layer on top that can route traffic to the correct Docker container on the correct machine. That is were Kubernetes' services come into play. A Kubernetes service has a static IP address and a DNS host name that will route to a dynamic number of containers running on the system. It doesn't matter if you are sending traffic to one app or a thousand -- everything goes through your one service that distributes it to the containers in your cluster transparently. All of that taken together, the dockerized app embedded in its replication controller, along with its service, is what in Kubernetes makes up one microservice. Obviously, you can run multiple microservices on one cluster, you can scale certain microservices up or down independently, or you can roll a microservice up to a new version, and, again, it will not affect other microservices. gRPC When you have multiple microservices running, communications between them becomes the most important part of your framework. According to Martin Fowler: The biggest issue in changing a monolith into microservices lies in changing the communication pattern. Communication between microservices is done with Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) and Google has 1010 RPCs per second. To help developers manage their RPCs they created gRPC. gRPC supports multiple languages, including Python, C/C++, PHP, Java, Ruby and, of course, Node.js; and uses Protocol Buffers v3 to encapsulate data sent from microservice to microservice. Protocol Buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. In many ways it is similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler according to Google. "Protocol Buffers" is technically an interface definition language (or IDL) that allows you to define your data once and generate interfaces for any language. It implements a data model for structured request and response, and your data can be compressed into a wire format, a binary format for quick network transmission. gRPC also uses HTTP/2, which is much faster than HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 supports multiplexing, opening a single TCP connection and sending all the packages over that. HTTP/1.1 opens a new connection every single time it has to send a package, which adds a lot overhead. HTTP/2 also supports bidirectional streaming, which means you do not have to do polling, sockets, or Server Send Events, because it allows you to do bidirectional streaming on the same single TCP connection easily. Finally, HTTP/2 supports flow control, allowing you to solve congestion issues on your network should they occur. Together, Kubernetes and gRPC, provide a comprehensive solution to the complexities involved in deploying a massive number of microservices to a cluster.

Close Skip to main content The Guardian Guardian morning briefing Tuesday briefing: Tory MPs reject their own Brexit report Committee report derided as ‘skewed and partisan’ … ex-CIA head criticises Trump travel ban … Google finds out it’s really cool by Graham Russell Committee report derided as ‘skewed and partisan’ … ex-CIA head criticises Trump travel ban … Google finds out it’s really cool by Graham Russell Tuesday briefing: Tory MPs reject their own Brexit report Tuesday 4 April 2017 01.38 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Top story: Brexit causes a fresh split Good morning, Graham Russell here bringing you a digest of this morning’s news. Plenty more ink is being spilled over Brexit, with Tory members of a parliamentary committee disowning their own report on leaving the European Union. One objector, Dominic Raab, described it as “rushed, skewed and partisan”. This comes a week after a third of the committee walked out of a meeting to discuss the report, angry at its negative tone. The committee chair, Hilary Benn, said the report was balanced and an example of a “select committee doing its job”. Labour MP Pat McFadden said his pro-Brexit colleagues were simply “annoyed by the facts”. The underlying bone of contention appears to be the report’s criticism of a lack of preparation for a worst-case scenario: exiting the EU without a trade deal. The report agrees with another committee’s conclusion that moving to deal on World Trade Organisation terms would be a “very destructive outcome” and says it is essential for MPs and Lords to have a vote in such a scenario. Still, the good news is that Theresa May has laughed off the idea of declaring war on Spain over Gibraltar, and Boris Johnson will use a meeting with his German counterpart to say the Rock will not turn into a bargaining chip. Trump ban ‘misguided’– John Brennan, a former CIA director, has described Donald Trump’s so far unsuccessful efforts to ban refugees and visitors arriving from Muslim countries as simplistic and unlikely to improve US security. He criticised the repeated use of the term “radical Islamic terrorism”, telling BBC’s Newsnight: “It legitimises the terrorist in terms of that they’re actually carrying out a legitimate tenet of the Islamic faith and they’re not.” Meanwhile, a one-time foreign policy adviser to Trump has been accused of handing energy industry documents to a Russian spy back in 2013. Court filings claim Carter Page – referred to catchily as “Male-1” – was groomed as an intelligence source by Victor Podobnyy, who is one of three men facing spying charges. Page left Trump’s campaign before the election but is under scrutiny by the FBI and various committees over Russian interference. Trump’s reaction to the Russia saga? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers. April 2, 2017 On a busy day of developments in the US, the new attorney general has ordered a review of all police reforms taken in the wake of high-profile shootings, a key part of Barack Obama’s criminal justice legacy. Search engineered? Google is just the coolest thing, research has found. Actually, no YouTube, which Google owns, was even cooler, according to a survey of Generation Zers. Even its browser Chrome, was pretty cool, and cooler than Nike. Now, we’re not shouting “fake views” but it’s worth pointing out the research was funded by Google, arousing some scepticism. Possibly overegging it, one 17-year-old respondent was quoted as saying Google was “not only a powerful search engine, but great at everything it does, from email to documents”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reker Ahmed. He played dominoes, drank tea – Reker Ahmed, the teenage asylum seeker who was badly beaten in Croydon on Friday, was a college student who was a familiar friendly face in the community, enjoying dominoes and tea at the local shisha. “He was polite and wasn’t racist. He was happy he was living here, he was trying to learn English,” said Mohammad, who saw Reker in the tea house. Farhad, a friend, said the 17-year-old was a quiet boy who stayed out of trouble. “We never saw him fighting,” he said. Reker has been moved out of intensive care, and five people have appeared in court charged with violent disorder. Body count – Governments might have to force companies to employ a certain quota of human workers as the costs of automation plunge and robots become cheaper than workers in even the poorest countries. Robots don’t get sick, have children, go on strike or take annual leave, a report by the International Bar Association points out. Hunger gains – It might not do much for the nation’s health but it could save the livelihoods of a lot of posties – New Zealand Post is trying out home-delivering Kentucky Fried Chicken. With the number of letters being delivered halving in a decade, there will presumably be plenty of room in the vans for Zingers, fillets and, er, the occasional big daddy. Lunchtime read: Gibraltar’s ‘true Europeans’ Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Jon Nazca/Reuters The Rock arouses fierce defensive passions in the UK (as we have seen this week) and yes it does still have those cute red phone boxes but for many Gibraltarians, the territory is anything but a sliver of British yesteryear, writes Sam Jones. Some 96% of its residents voted to remain in the EU, and its economy depends heavily on the single market and freedom of movement – 12,000 Spanish and other EU nationals commute across its border daily. Human rights lawyer James Netto says: “Our Saturday tapas are followed by a full Sunday roast. We regularly cross an international border that was once firmly shut. We prove that British national pride and a love for the EU can overlap.” Sport Andy Tennant has defended the medal‑or‑nothing ethos of British Cycling as it awaits UK Sport’s review of its culture and history, with the pursuit specialist saying it is not all about being “all cuddly and care bears”. Alastair Cook has insisted there will be no problems playing alongside his successor as England cricket captain, Joe Root, come the South Africa series in July. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Louise Taylor writes that comments made by David Moyes to the BBC’s Vicki Sparks highlighted there still resides an attitude of contempt for women in football under the shiny new politically correct facade. Liverpool fear they could be without Sadio Mané for a lengthy period after the striker limped out of the Merseyside derby with a knee problem, and Crystal Palace’s shock win over Chelsea, Coventry’s Wembley joy and another title for Celtic all feature in the latest Football Weekly podcast. Business Asian markets appeared to be on edge with little movement before the big must-watch meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday. The markets were however in little doubt on the prospects of South Africa’s economy with Standard & Poor’s reducing its credit rating to junk status after President Jacob Zuma sacked his respected finance minister. The pound is buying $1.24 and €1.16. The papers It’s back to the 1990s day at the Sun. The splash is full-bore redtop: “Up yours Senors!” – a revisit of its infamous headline from 1 November 1990: “Up Yours Delors”. This time the object of its ire is Spain which wants to get its hands on Gibraltar. Interesting that the top of the front has a holiday deal puff to France, Germany ... and Spain. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Mail says 3 million people have card debts they can’t repay and that banks have no incentive to help those in trouble. The Mirror leads with two men jailed for life after torturing a couple with boiling water before stealing thousands of pounds in cash from their home. The burglars were later arrested on a plane after a shopping spree in Dubai. The FT reports that the eurozone’s unemployment rate is at an eight-year low as the economic recovery gathers pace. The Times says a report by MPs has accused contractors in the foreign aid sector of ripping off taxpayers by overcharging for their services. The Telegraph lastly bemoans the loss of Easter – it says that figures from the Church of England have accused the National Trust of “airbrushing faith” after it rebranded its Easter egg hunt as the “great British egg hunt”. Eggxit, one could say. For more news: www.theguardian.com If you would like to receive the Guardian Morning Briefing by email every weekday at 7am, sign up here.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S8: Which is the… Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S8: Which is the better Android phone? By Christian de Looper — April 2, 2017 12:00 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Well folks, the wait is over. Samsung has finally taken the wraps off of the long-awaited Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, two phones that are tipped to be the most powerful and stylish phones of 2017. As the powerhouses they are, however, they’re sure to go up against some competition — like, for example, the much-loved Google Pixel. More: Everything we know about Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus pricing and availability The Google Pixel may be a few months old now, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t hold its own. How do the two phones compare? We put their specs head to head to find out. Specs Google Pixel Samsung Galaxy S8 Size 143.8 x 69.5 x 7.3mm (5.6 x 2.7 x 0.2-0.3-inches) 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0mm (5.9 x 2.7 x 0.3-inches) Weight 143g (5.0 oz) 155g (5.5oz) Screen 5.0-inch AMOLED 5.8-inch AMOLED Resolution 1,080 x 1,920 pixels (441 pixels per inch) 2,960 x 1,440 pixels (570ppi) OS Android 7.1 Nougat Android 7.0 Nougat Storage 32/128GB 64GB MicroSD card slot No Yes NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Samsung Exynos 9 Series 8895 (International) RAM 4GB 4GB Connectivity GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE GSM / CDMA / HSPA / LTE Camera 12MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear with OIS, 8MP front Video 2,160p at 30fps 2,160p at 30fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 5.0 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, barometer Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, heart rate, iris scanner Water resistant No IP68 Battery 2,770mAh 3,000mAh Ports USB-C, headphone jack USB-C, headphone jack Marketplace Google Play Google Play Color offerings Very Silver, Quite Black, Really Blue Black, silver, orchid grey, blue (international), gold (international) Availability Google Play, Verizon April 21 Price Starts at $650 Starts at $720 DT review 4 out of 5 stars First take In the specs department, there’s unsurprisingly a clear winner. When the Google Pixel was released, it featured a top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, a chip that was the best choice available to Google at the time. Months later, Qualcomm’s out with a new, better chip: The Snapdragon 835. We don’t yet know exactly how much better the Snapdragon 835 performs compared to the Snapdragon 821, but early benchmark results indicate the new chip is a good 20 percent or more than its predecessor. Processor performance isn’t the only thing to consider here — but it is perhaps most important. Both phones offer 4GB of RAM. but when it comes to internal storage the Google Pixel offers options of either 32GB or 128GB, while you only have a choice of 64GB on the Galaxy S8 sits in at 64GB. The base model of the Galaxy S8 offers more than the base model of the Pixel, but what’s more is the Galaxy S8 offers a MicroSD card slot, so you can expand on your storage by up to 256GB. Considering the fact the Galaxy S8 has a much better processor, the better performing device is unsurprisingly the Samsung Galaxy S8.

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

The door have long been blown right open. We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross. Will S. Sweet...They should've thought of this years ago though... JG Google does (or at least did) have a parent share agreement with Samsung and someone else... I wouldn't be opposed to finding or this enhances that and allows OEMs to share features easier. I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel.

According to CEOs of leading global technology firms, Kenya urgently needs to equip its youth with specialised skills required to compete across the digital economy. US-based multinational Google is one of the firms that have been at the front advocating for improvements in the country's ICT curriculum. The firm recently revealed it had completed its ambitious programme to train one million African youth with digital and entrepreneurship skills. Launched in April 2016, the Google's Digital Skills for Africa Programme delivered trainings through both face-to-face by Google partners and through an online platform the firm set up. Through the platform and trainings, the students were expected to build an online presence, create content, understand web design and user experience, social media and app development. "In 2016, we committed to train one million young Africans in digital skills within a year," explained Charles Murito, Google Kenya Country Manager. Of the one million youth trained, 97 per cent were trained offline, in person through 14 partner organisations spread across Africa. In Kenya, the partners included Centum Learning, Africa 118, and E-Mobilis. Most of the programme trainees came from Kenya and Nigeria where Google has been able to develop key strategic relationships with youth organisations and government institutions. Mr Murito stated that Kenya had a strong showing in the programme and that the firm was able to exceed its target across sub-Saharan Africa indicating a demand for the learning resources. "Now that we've trained 400,000 youth in Kenya and exceeded the one million overall target, we plan to focus a lot more on driving deep impact at the regional, county and local community levels through partnerships that lead directly to job creation and business growth," Murito stated. Speaking at the Digital Skills for Africa event, ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru acknowledged the need to build on the existing skills to safeguard Kenya's position in the global digital economy. "The Internet is at the heart of economic growth and a rising contributor to Kenya's GDP," he said. "Initiatives such as Google's Digital Skills for Africa support the development of digital entrepreneurship and new job opportunities critical to attaining transformative social and economic growth. The next phase of program me will see Google extend its commitment to help communities outside urban centres in Africa acquire digital skills. This will be achieved by rolling out offline versions of the online training materials to reach individuals and businesses in low access areas. According to World Bank data, about 74 per cent of Kenya's total population resided in rural areas. Mr Mucheru observed that the government's own Ajira Digital Programme launched early this year to enable young people obtain paying jobs online, will be looped into Google's next project phase. Plans to have offline trainings delivered in African languages such as Swahili, Zulu and Hausa are also underway with the hope to reach students, job seekers and business owners.

The long list includes household names such as Starbucks, Pepsi, Walmart, Tesco, the BBC and the UK government. Some have even suggested that they may have inadvertently sponsored extremist and hateful groups to the tune of more than £250,000. To understand how, it’s helpful to recall how Google services such as YouTube work. When we watch a video clip we may see ads and we often skip them. But for Google the ad is the important thing – something like 90% of its revenue comes from selling ads. When an ad is placed around a YouTube video, Google charges the advertiser and shares some of the revenue with the user who posted the video. Vloggers such as Zoella make a pretty penny from this. Google’s targeting technologies can allow advertisers to place their ads around specific types of videos or present them to specific groups of viewers. So what’s the problem? Surely it is acceptable for brands to choose which content they sponsor? Isn’t this what happens on traditional media? Given that brands can target their ads already perhaps something else is going on. Over the firewall Brands certainly have the right to demand which content their ads appear alongside. On traditional media, a brand might not want its ads placed alongside a report about a terror campaign, for example. But it is not considered acceptable for them to say that the newspaper shouldn’t report such events at all. To get around this, traditional media companies separate news and information operations from advertising operations. The problem with services like Google and other social media platforms is that such organisational firewalls don’t exist. As a result, there are potential hidden biases that can come about when advertisers insist that content matches their “company values”. Ironically enough, this problem is spelled out pretty well in a 1998 paper by Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They wrote that the “goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users”. The example they cited from a prototype version of Google saw a search for mobile phones pull up a study which went into detail about the risks of speaking on a phone while driving. They concluded that a search engine company which was taking money for mobile phone ads would struggle to justify that kind of search result to paying advertisers. Brin and Page concluded that: Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. That belief underpins why Google search separates out advertising sponsored links from organic search results. On YouTube, however, responsibility for the content of videos and the placement of ads is delegated onto viewers, users and brands through its terms of service and advertising policies. Indeed, from my analysis of 45 published cases by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority that involved YouTube, there were 44 in which YouTube responded that users, viewers and brands were responsible for the ads people saw on the service – not them. In just a single case, did YouTube accept that an ad should be taken down following a complaint to the ASA. So, one way of looking at the current boycott is that’s it’s a case of brands pushing responsibility for content and placement back onto Google/YouTube who, up to now, have been very successful in passing this responsibility onto brands and user. Weeding There is another way of looking at it, and that is as an indirect way for brands to claim more power over the type of content that people can share online. If Google has to “weed out extremist views” (as politicians such as Yvette Cooper have requested), it has to define what is extremist. The problem here is that Google’s approach to consulting with other institutions about how it operates is often spiky – as their engagement with the ASA illustrates. If they only listen to what brands want, it leaves them very susceptible to the types of insidious biases that Brin and Page spoke about in their 1998 paper: see its definition of “advertiser-friendly content”. Might they start to direct viewers towards advertising-friendly content? They could, for example, push other content down their search results and recommended video lists. So what does Google do next in the stand off with the big brands? Chief Business Officer Philip Schindler told Bloomberg that the firm has improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads. He also revealed that giant health products firm, Johnson & Johnson, has rolled back its boycott in some major markets. More broadly though, the solution is for Google to be far more transparent and engaged in the societies in which it operates. It needs to respond to brands and consumers but other social institutions as well. We all have to decide what is acceptable, not an algorithm, brands, politicians or individual YouTube viewers.

Google’s targeting technologies can allow advertisers to place their ads around specific types of videos or present them to specific groups of viewers. So what’s the problem? Surely it is acceptable for brands to choose which content they sponsor? Isn’t this what happens on traditional media? Given that brands can target their ads already perhaps something else is going on. Over the firewall Brands certainly have the right to demand which content their ads appear alongside. On traditional media, a brand might not want its ads placed alongside a report about a terror campaign, for example. But it is not considered acceptable for them to say that the newspaper shouldn’t report such events at all. To get around this, traditional media companies separate news and information operations from advertising operations. The problem with services like Google and other social media platforms is that such organisational firewalls don’t exist. As a result, there are potential hidden biases that can come about when advertisers insist that content matches their “company values”. Ironically enough, this problem is spelled out pretty well in a 1998 paper by Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They wrote that the “goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users”. The example they cited from a prototype version of Google saw a search for mobile phones pull up a study which went into detail about the risks of speaking on a phone while driving. They concluded that a search engine company which was taking money for mobile phone ads would struggle to justify that kind of search result to paying advertisers. Brin and Page concluded that: Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. That belief underpins why Google search separates out advertising sponsored links from organic search results. On YouTube, however, responsibility for the content of videos and the placement of ads is delegated onto viewers, users and brands through its terms of service and advertising policies. Indeed, from my analysis of 45 published cases by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority that involved YouTube, there were 44 in which YouTube responded that users, viewers and brands were responsible for the ads people saw on the service – not them. In just a single case, did YouTube accept that an ad should be taken down following a complaint to the ASA. So, one way of looking at the current boycott is that’s it’s a case of brands pushing responsibility for content and placement back onto Google/YouTube who, up to now, have been very successful in passing this responsibility onto brands and user. Weeding There is another way of looking at it, and that is as an indirect way for brands to claim more power over the type of content that people can share online. If Google has to “weed out extremist views” (as politicians such as Yvette Cooper have requested), it has to define what is extremist. The problem here is that Google’s approach to consulting with other institutions about how it operates is often spiky – as their engagement with the ASA illustrates. If they only listen to what brands want, it leaves them very susceptible to the types of insidious biases that Brin and Page spoke about in their 1998 paper: see its definition of “advertiser-friendly content”. Might they start to direct viewers towards advertising-friendly content? They could, for example, push other content down their search results and recommended video lists. So what does Google do next in the stand off with the big brands? Chief Business Officer Philip Schindler told Bloomberg that the firm has improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads. He also revealed that giant health products firm, Johnson & Johnson, has rolled back its boycott in some major markets. More broadly though, the solution is for Google to be far more transparent and engaged in the societies in which it operates. It needs to respond to brands and consumers but other social institutions as well. We all have to decide what is acceptable, not an algorithm, brands, politicians or individual YouTube viewers.

The tech giant started testing the OS back in January and not so long ago, a second beta was made available to those participating in the beta program. Google has not done away with the beta program, with the OTA update now rolling out to all eligible devices. As usual, the search engine giant has made everything easy for those who feel that waiting for the OTA notification is not their thing. If you are okay with flashing factory images to your phone or tablet, the company has already published these files for you to download them. You can also grab the OTA files from the company’s servers and install them directly on your phone. Unlike the case with Android 7.1.1 Nougat, the currently rolling out Android 7.1.2 Nougat is not supported on the likes of Google Nexus 6 and both versions of the Google Nexus 9 tablet. These two devices will no longer be receiving a major Android update, instead, they’ll only be receiving monthly security updates. For those using the Google Pixel and Nexus devices from 2015 onwards, there’s nothing to worry about, even if the OTA notification doesn’t show up on your phone today. According to Google, this update to Android 7.1.2 Nougat will be rolled out gradually over the coming weeks and other than coming in with a new version of the OS, it also carries several bug fixes, new features, general stability and performance enhancements as well as the latest monthly security patch for the month of April.   Users of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL should watch out for an Android 7.1.2 Nougat OTA update that carries software version N2G47E or N2G47J while those using the Google Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X will be receiving firmware version N2G47H and N2G47F, respectively. As for the Google Pixel C and Nexus Player, you get versions N2G47D and N2G47H, respectively. As noted earlier, those who can’t wait for the OTA notification to hit their devices can grab the latest Android 7.1.2 Nougat OTA and factory image files via the official Google websites below.

Maybe its in our DNA, but men seem more inclined to take stupid risks. NOAA data since 2010 shows that two thirds of all flooding fatalities were men. More than half of these deaths were related to driving through flooded roads. Apparently men, sitting up high in a pickup truck or SUV, are more inclined to believe they can make it to the other side. The USA experienced 6 separate thousand-year floods in 2016, costing $17.5 billion and 148 deaths - far more than from tornadoes and hurricanes combined. Twisters and massive storms (with names) get most of the media attention, but flash floods are deadlier overall. Skies brighten today; highs in the 50s until next weekend, when a stiff southerly breeze lures the mercury well into the 60s to near 70F. If you don't have The Fever yet, you will by Saturday afternoon. Big, sloppy storms track south of Minnesota until next week, when rain becomes more widespread statewide. No slush in sight. Don't laugh; a typical April brings 2.4 inches of snow. Today's Excessive Rainfall Outlook. NOAA WPC has a helpful outlook, highlighting regions of the USA ripe for flash flooding. Today shows an elevated risk for the Florida Panhandle, but we don't expect the extreme rainfall amounts that soaked the Gulf Coast and Mid South in recent days. No Rest For The Weary. What's impressive is the persistence of a high-frequency storm pattern; areas of low pressure spaced 24-36 hours apart, leaving little time for soil to dry out - ultimately increasing the risk of flooding as heavy rain falls on saturated ground. Today's storm pushes rain across the Northeast with a mix of snow, ice and rain for northern New England. Another storm spins up over the central Plains, pushing a shield of rain changing to snow across the Midwest, Ohio Valley and Great Lakes by Friday. Rain continues to soak the Pacific Northwest; the next chance of heavy rain for California coming Thursday night and Friday. 84-hour NAM Future Radar: NOAA and Tropicaltidbits.com. Spring Loses Its Bounce. Wednesday's storm will start out as rain across the Midwest, Ohio Valley and Great Lakes, but a changeover to slushy snow is likely as the column of air cools; plowable amounts possible from Madison to Fort Wayne, Detroit and Cleveland by Friday.

Oceans have a moderating influence, putting an atmospheric break on how big the temperature oscillations can be. The biggest extremes take place near the center of continents. No kidding. 60s will feel good next weekend with an outside shot at 70 Saturday afternoon if the sun stays out. A few showers and T-storms blossoming by Sunday may keep us from hitting 70 degrees. MSP outlook from ECMWF: WeatherBell. 2-Week Outlook. The GFS forecast for 500 mb winds roughly 2 weeks out suggests a showery cut-off low pressure system over the Midwest, but relative warmth over the east coast and much of the western USA.   Massive Flooding Hits Columbia. The Washington Post has details: "An avalanche of water from three overflowing rivers swept through a small city in Colombia while people slept, destroying homes, sweeping away cars and killing at least 193 unsuspecting residents. The incident triggered by intense rains happened around midnight in Mocoa, a provincial capital of about 40,000 tucked between mountains near Colombia’s southern border with Ecuador. Muddy water and debris quickly surged through the city’s streets, toppling homes, ripping trees from their roots and carrying them downstream. Many of the residents did not have enough time to climb on top of their roofs or seek refuge on higher ground. According to the Red Cross, 400 people were injured and 220 believed missing..." Xenia (Ohio) Tornado Anniversary. The Super Outbreak of April 3, 1974 was staggering in scope and intensity; one of the reasons I ultimately became a meteorologist. The Xenia Gazette remembers that terrible day: "The tornado injured 1,150 and destroyed approximately 1,400 buildings — about half of those in Xenia. Nine schools, nine churches and almost 180 businesses were destroyed in the F5 tornado, which claimed more than 30 lives. The twister was part of the the 1974 Super Outbreak, which was the second-largest tornado outbreak on record for a single 24-hour period, just behind the 2011 Super Outbreak. It was also the most violent tornado outbreak ever recorded, with 30 F4/F5 tornadoes confirmed. From April 3 to April 4, 1974, there were 148 tornadoes confirmed in 13 U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. Tornadoes struck Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and New York. The entire outbreak caused more than $600 million (in 1974 dollars) in damage in the U.S. alone, and extensively damaged approximately 900 square miles along a total combined path length of 2,600 miles according to online reports. At one point, as many as 15 separate tornadoes were ongoing at the same time..."   Photo credit: "Monday was the 43rd anniversary of the 1974 Xenia tornado. The days and months after April 3, 1974, tornado were filled with many scenes like the ones you see here. The tornado injured 1,150 and destroyed some 1,400 buildings — about half of those in Xenia. Nine schools, nine churches and almost 180 businesses were destroyed in the F5 tornado." Tornado Sirens are "Cold War Technology". Remember that sirens were only meant to be heard outdoors,  not inside homes and businesses. Sirens are part of the warning process, but if you only rely on sirens you're going to get caught with your Doppler down. Here's a clip from News-Gazette: "...While people in the country might not be able to hear the sirens, just about every emergency official interviewed for this story pointed out without prompting that tornado sirens are outdoor warning sirens. "You won't hear them inside your house," Mahomet's Crowley said. "If your windows are closed, you're not going to hear it unless you're right under it." The NWS' Miller said sirens aren't necessarily the best way to learn about a potential tornado. "There's so many ways to get information," he said. "Don't just say, 'I'm not going to go to the basement until the siren goes off.'" He encouraged people to use a weather radio and to monitor social media. Smartphones also now automatically send alerts for tornado and flash flood warnings. "To be honest, it's Cold War technology," Miller said about tornado sirens. "It's an important part of the process, but what people have to understand is, it's not the only part of the process." Vast, Untapped Potential for Solar Rooftops in the U.S., Says Google. Here's an excerpt of a post at Greentech Media that made me do a double-take: "...Now that Project Sunroof's availability is countrywide, Google’s amassed data has started to reveal some interesting trends and information. For one thing, Google says that 79 percent of the rooftops it’s analyzed are viable for solar, which is good news for rooftop solar providers. That doesn’t mean that 79 percent of rooftops should or will adopt solar, though. Rather, it means that 79 percent technically get enough sun to be able to accommodate solar panels.  That finding is likely a generous interpretation of the data..." A "Solar Saudi Arabia". No coal, gas or oil? Not to worry in Chile, which is blasted by free solar energy yearround. There may be no country on Earth in a better position to take full advantage of clean, renewable power, argues The Washington Post: "...It is also the world’s best place to produce solar energy, with the most potent sun power on the planet. So powerful, in fact, that something extraordinary happened last year when the Chilean government invited utility companies to bid on public contracts. Solar producers dominated the auction, offering to supply electricity at about half the cost of coal-fired plants. It wasn’t because of a government subsidy for alternative energy. In Chile and a growing list of nations, the price of solar energy has fallen so much that it is increasingly beating out conventional sources of power. Industry experts and government regulators hail this moment as a turning point in the history of human electricity-making. “This is the beginning of a trend that will only accelerate,” said Chilean Energy Minister Andrés Rebolledo. “We’re talking about an infinite fuel source...” Wind Power Cuts CO2. Here's an excerpt from Climate Central: "We’ve reached the end of the windiest month of the year. But in other months, wind will continue to play an increasingly large role in the U.S. power mix. At the end of last year, wind capacity surpassed hydroelectric capacity for the first time in the U.S. Over the past decade, wind power has exploded in the U.S. Over that time, generating capacity from wind has increased by a factor of seven, surpassing 82,000 megawatts, or enough to power 24 million homes. Wind is most consistent in the Great Plains and on the Front Range of the Rockies. The prevailing west winds come rushing off of the mountains, making the area especially conducive for generating electricity, as higher wind speeds produce disproportionately more power from a wind turbine..." The Next Million Jobs Will Come From Startups Across America, But Not Without Smarter Public Policy. Here's an excerpt of a post at Forbes that caught my eye: "...The report argues that overly strict rules governing crowdfunding sometimes limit the ability of startups to raise funds on the local level and that changing tax policy to support innovation will make it easier for companies to pour money back into research and development. And improving access to overseas markets and limiting trade barriers will open up new opportunities for startups to grow their businesses and scale. It also suggests increasing investment in entrepreneurial and STEM-related education similar to the curriculum at the Chicago Tech Academy and a growing number of schools across America.  The Technet-published report says Congress needs to tackle immigration reform to make it “easier for immigrant entrepreneurs to build new companies in the United States..." .05" of rain fell at MSP International Airport yesterday as of 7 pm. 53 F. maximum temperature yesterday in the Twin Cities. 51 F. average high on April 3. 68 F. high temperature on April 3, 2016.

An Op-Ed at USA TODAY captures the sense of disbelief that facts, data and evidence have become optional and politicized: "...We have no trouble believing that dinosaurs lived 150 million years ago, but who can even count back that far? We take it on faith that the continents drift around on tectonic plates like ice floes in a slush pond, but the ground feels pretty stable to me. Even though none of us can independently verify any of these things, most of us accept them as facts, not assertions. We recognize them as the settled conclusions of qualified experts who have studied the evidence carefully and ruled out every competing hypothesis. That’s what science does; it extends our reach and allows us to make connections, connect dots, that we couldn’t possibly link on our own. If we accepted only the evidence of our senses, we’d still think that the Earth was flat and the sun and stars revolved around us. When it comes to climate change, however, the Earth is still flat. Scientific facts have somehow become opinions, and carefully researched conclusions are written off as theories or even hoaxes. Climate scientists went to the same schools, earned the same degrees, and follow the same protocols as experts we wouldn’t begin to question on other matters, but millions of us find it easy to say, “I don’t think so....” Image credit: Jeff Williams, NASA. Climate Change Doesn't Care Who You Voted For. Here's a clip from Teen Vogue. What, you don't read Teen Vogue? "...Climate change denial has been able to flourish because it papers over a painful reality. It’s hard to reconcile the scope of danger with the sense that there is nothing we can do about it, but political inefficacy is just another myth in need of rejection. We must come together to insist on the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions via federal effort. Each passing day in this DEFCON 1 political climate, it seems less and less possible to bridge the party divide, but we can all be united by the need for clean air, fresh water, and a better world for our children. As it stands, Trump’s climate change policy puts all of those things at risk, and unfortunately floods and droughts don’t give a crap whom you voted for." The Case for Climate Risk Investing in Trump Era. Here's a clip from The Wall Street Journal: "...According to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, climate change and carbon emissions was “the most significant overall environmental factor” for socially-minded investors in the U.S., drawing allocation of $2.15 trillion in institutional investor assets in the year ended Dec. 31, 2015. Shareholder proposals focusing on the climate risk are also getting more support, even if none got majority approval over board opposition so far. According to Proxy Monitor, an arm of the Manhattan Institute’s Center for Legal Policy that tracks resolutions filed with Fortune 250 companies, 23 of the total 58 environmental-related proposals as of the end of June, 2016, got 26% of the vote, compared with 16% support in 2015 and 14% in the 2006-2015 period..." As the Maldives Gains Tourists, It's Losing Its Beaches. The New York Times reports. Why One Powerful Republican Doubts Trump's Climate Policy. Details via The Atlantic: "...He agrees with Bill Gates that the best solution to climate change is ultimately technological. “We need technology—which thrives in market capitalism, so we need that—but we need the right policies that accommodate whatever emerges as the price winner,” he said. But he also has a distinct view of carbon-dioxide emissions—or at least a view closer to the long-term actuarial analysis of utility companies. Because a future Congress or White House will likely impose a policy like the Clean Power Plan, carbon dioxide is a price risk, he says. If he doesn’t move coal out of the fleet now, Arkansas customers may have to pay more for electricity in the future. “Life is pretty good right now, in utility world,” he said. “Costs as a percentage of personal income are at a multi-decade low, and that’s driven by low [natural] gas prices...” Photo credit: "President Donald Trump shakes hands with Michael Nelson, a coal miner, early in February." Carlos Barria / Reuters. Even Fox News Slams EPA Chief's Climate Denial: "All Kinds of Studies Contradict You". Kudos to Chris Wallace for drilling down and challenging the new EPA Administrator, as reported at ThinkProgress: "Even Fox News can’t believe that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, doesn’t accept the basic scientific finding that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to recent global warming. To promote President Trump’s disastrous plan to gut EPA and U.S. climate action, Pruitt has been pushing his dangerous beliefs on all the major networks. Pruitt may have thought the Murdoch-owned network that has led the way on attacking climate science for two decades would be a friendly audience. He was wrong. Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace thoroughly debunked Pruitt for defending his absurd claim that CO2 is not “a primary contributor to the global warming that we see...” MIT Climate Scientist Responds on Disaster Costs and Climate Change. Here's an excerpt from FiveThirtyEight: "...Looking ahead, I collaborated with Yale economist Robert Mendelsohn and his colleagues in estimating global hurricane damage changes through the year 2100, based on hurricanes “downscaled” from four climate models. We estimate that global hurricane damage will about double owing to demographic trends, and double again because of climate change. These projections are not inconsistent with what we’ve been seeing in hurricane data and in economic damage from hurricanes. Besides this study, there are robust theory and modeling results that show increased risk of hydrological extremes (floods and droughts) and heat-related problems. Some of these predicted trends are beginning to emerge in actuarial data. Governments, markets and ordinary people are beginning to account for the increased risk. Those who wait for actuarial trends to emerge at the 95 percent confidence level before acting do so at their peril." (Hurricane Joaquin file image: NASA). Climate Change Pushing Floods, Cyclones to New Extremes. As ocean waters continue to warm what will be the impact on cyclone (hurricane) intensity going forward? With Australia's Cyclone Debbie in mind, here's an excerpt of a post at Climate Code Red: "...The frequency of major flood events (defined as events which caused extensive flooding within 50 kilometres of the coast, or inundation that extended 20 kilometres along the coast) along Australia's eastern seaboard has doubled in last 150 years, with climate change one of the possible factors, senior Bureau of Meteorology researchers say.  Record-breaking heavy rainfall and a clear upward trend in downpours over the last 30 years fits in with global temperature rise caused by greenhouse gases. Statistical analysis of rainfall data from 1901 to 2010 around the globe, shows that from 1980 to 2010 there were 12% more of these intense events than would be expected in a climate without global warming. Wet regions generally saw a bigger increase in deluges and drier regions a smaller one. In southeast Asia, the observed increase in record-breaking rainfall events is as high as 56%..."

Consider this penance for a stunning, postcard-worthy Saturday. The sun peeks out again today after a gray start, with fairly quiet weather spilling into Saturday, when temperatures mellow well into the 60s to near 70. A growl of thunder Sunday marks the leading edge of cooler air. No drama; Minnesota gets off easy compared to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, where plowable amounts of snow are possible by Thursday.

It was gray, cool and showery, but at least we're not ankle-deep in slush. A shower or sprinkle is possible today, but compared to much of the USA Minnesota and Wisconsin is still getting off pretty easy. After 50s this week we warm into the 60s next weekend. 70F is not out of the question before we cool off again. The transition into spring is more of a stumble than a stroll. We'll get there. Blogs April 1 April Showers Today - Shot at 70F Next Sunday - "Tornado Amnesia" What can one possibly say about Saturday's weather? It was nothing short of extraordinary; a fine April Fool's joke with an afternoon high 16 degrees warmer than average under a postcard-perfect blue sky.

Confirming the decision to allow advertisers to use third party verification, Google’s chief business officer Phillip Schindler said the exposure to such videos was not as big as advertisers feared. “When we spoke with many of our top brand advertisers, it was clear that the videos they had flagged received less than 1/1000th of a percent of the advertisers’ total impressions,” Schindler said. “Of course, when we find that ads mistakenly ran against content that doesn’t comply with our policies, we immediately remove those ads.” Having downplayed the impact of the exposure to undesirable videos – which has seen the Federal Government, Telstra, Holden, Kia, Bunnings and dozens of other companies suspend advertising on the platform – a spokesperson for Google said it was expanding its commitment to transparency. “As part of our commitment to provide even more transparency and visibility to our advertising partners, we’ll be working with trusted vendors to provide third party brand safety reporting on YouTube,” the spokesperson said. “We are working with companies that are MRC-accredited for ad verification on this initiative and will begin integrating these technologies shortly.” On Monday Google announced it was also working to develop its AI to better identify content advertisers want to avoid, increasing its defimnitions of hate speech and is also implementing a brand safety reporting channel which will allow companies including comScore and Integral Ad Science to monitor ad placement. Last week one of Australia’s largest programmatic buyers, Admatic, advised its entire client base to suspend advertising on YouTube until Google was able to provide greater clarity on the issue.

If they want advertisers, they need to provide a 100% brand safe place for ads to run. Reply Hearing you AND 4 Apr 17 Brands want to know they are safe, for sure. Why just the focus on Google though? Brands who advertise say on the News Corp or Daily Mail networks are exposing their brands to [edited under Mumbrella’s comment moderation policy] and to a very aggravating, acerbic tone, everyday. Why are clients not pulling their dollars away from these platforms? Why just the focus on Google, who say that it was minimal and are tightening up their processes. Is it because clients are agencies get wined and dined and don’t want to lose the perks? This is a serious question.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Software updates-Software updates+ Google-Google+ Google has finally published the Android 7.1.2 Nougat factory images and OTA files after reports emerged the search giant is rolling out the update to the Pixel C tablet and Nexus Player. Not long ago, the Android 7.1.2 Nougat builds for all compatible Nexus and Pixel devices made it on Google's dev website. Keep in mind though that there are two devices that will not be getting the update, specifically the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. The following Pixel and Nexus devices can be now be upgraded to Android 7.1.2 Nougat: Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus Player, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P. Even if you haven't yet received the update on your Nexus or Pixel devices, you can download the OTA image manually and flash it yourself. Android 7.1.2 Nougat brings a couple of improvements and fixes, such as better fingerprint swipe performance, battery usage alerts, and Bluetooth connectivity enhancements. According to Google, “some of the other fixes are with the early shutdown issue, a fix for the small number of users experiencing pink banding on the camera, and a fix to the audio popping issue some users were experiencing at high volumes.” Of course, the update includes the latest April security patch, which hasn't been released by any other handset maker yet.

Join For Free MongoDB Atlas is a database as a service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale MongoDB. So you can focus on innovation, not operations. Brought to you in partnership with MongoDB. I’m working on a technical blog post that I hope to be putting up soon. I’ve run into a number of configuration issues that I’m working through. However, it’s these issues that sparked this blog post. See, we’re learning Azure all wrong. Use Google/Bing What’s the first thing you do when you hit a problem on your computer, regardless of the language, the technology, etc.? Wrong! You don’t call your son-in-law who “works in computers.” That’s what my mother-in-law does. We already “work in computers” so we have another resource. Bingle/Ging/Boogle. We run a search. So, let’s say for example I’m interested in learning about an Azure PowerShell command: Set-AzureRMDiagnosticSetting. Here are the first two results from Google (as of this date, 4/3/2017, or for all my UK friends, 3/4/2017, in text, April 3, 2017): And here are the first two from Bing: Great, right? Wrong. The first result in each case is for an older version of the documentation. Yet, it’s coming up on top on both search engines. If you go there and read it, you’re going to be getting incorrect (worse, incomplete) documentation on the latest version of the AureRM model. What to Do? Short answer, we can’t rely on default searches. You have to go to “Advanced Search” in Google. Select the option to only show the results that have been updated within a year. There you’ll find this as the top result: That is the correct result. Now, Bing... well, I tried several different ways of filtering the dates, but none of them put this result at the top. In fact, I tried several different search criteria and it didn’t even show up in the list anymore once I started filtering by date. Bing must only go by the Create Date instead of some kind of Modification Date, which Google takes into account So You’re Saying to Use Google No. Well, yes. Maybe. No, that’s not the intent of this post. The main thing I’m saying is that we all rely on the results of quick searches against Internet search engines. However, for some searches, we may be getting bad and/or out of date information. In fact, especially when talking about Azure, we are. Look up any of the Azure technologies and if not the top result, certainly within the top 5, will be all sorts of information showing off the old Azure portal (or even the older one). I guarantee that large amounts of that information are no longer applicable. If you’re learning Azure and you research things using a search engine, then I strongly recommend you use the ability to limit your searches to the last year. Otherwise, you may be getting incomplete or incorrect data. At this precise moment, I’d say you need to limit your searches to Google (although I honestly hate recommending one of these tools over the other, let’s keep the competition fierce) because I was able to easily get the correct information within a couple of mouse clicks.

[Update: 6.8] Latest Play Store 6.7 Enables The Beta Testing Features For Some Users [APK Download] Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2016/06/29 4:40pm PDTJun 29, 2016 44 Plus 1 on G+ 57 Share on Facebook 2 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Applications Downloads Google News Update 1: 2016/06/29 4:45pm PDT Update by Artem: Ever since we posted this article on May 23, the Beta tab has been slowly rolling out to more and more people, and we continue getting tips about it daily. Last week, the Play Store rolled up some beta testing features in its version 6.7 update, but they quickly disappeared as Google reverted them back in a server-side change. The company later announced these features at I/O as part of a series of improvements to Google Play that also include lots of developer console changes. Now it seems that the beta testing options have started showing up again for users on version 6.7.12 of the Play Store. To be clear, neither Artem nor Cody nor I am seeing it on our devices, even after clearing the Play Store's data. So it looks to be a staggered server switch with very few devices let in on the action. The screenshots here were provided by other users who are seeing a new Beta tab under the My apps & games section of the Play Store. This is where all the apps which betas they have enrolled in show up. Dat QuickPic beta test... Once you tap on one of these, you'll see the notice that you're a beta tester above the description and you'll be able to leave it immediately. Joining open betas is also now done through the Play Store instead of requiring you to go to a specific URL to become a tester. If you're still waiting on version 6.7.12 of the Play Store to roll to your device, you can speed up the process by grabbing the app manually from APK Mirror. Once you do, let us know if you see this new tab in your Play Store app, and also if you have any of the other new beta-related features like sending private feedback to developers and the Google Play Early Access section for unreleased apps. Update 1: 2016/06/29 4:45pm PDT Update by Artem: Ever since we posted this article on May 23, the Beta tab has been slowly rolling out to more and more people, and we continue getting tips about it daily. I'm bumping this post today because: Play Store 6.8 was released today. Unfortunately, the Beta tab and other features are still controlled server-side even with this version, but you should probably update to it regardless. Hopefully, more of our readers will see the post and realize their new Beta tab is just another staged Google rollout that's been going live for over a month now (our tips inbox will thank you).

Slowpoke New experimental ads on lockscreen. Bikas It's no longer bloat in Quickpic, it's Quickpic in haystack of bloats.

BACKFLASH The sad truth is that it's not a joke. Corey Watford Crazy I think there is more hate for QuickPic than Apple on AP XD Bruno Martins Nice to see a upgrade in that, a better way to know which apps we have in beta! Bruno Martins But unfortunately it's not working for me.. Andrew Just installed that 6.7.12. Still no any new features. Gopinath M S tat beta tab is what android play store needed blurkness Still no tab for "paid" apps.:( Rita El Khoury Not *exactly* the same thing, but if you go to Account > Order History, you'll see a list of all your purchases, even redeemed apps from codes. There's a search feature there too so it's kinda cool. blurkness Yeah, i know but still not good enough. The order list shows the in app purchases and the consequence is my subscriptions on Play Music and other apps taking all over the list. salacious I've been using My Paid Apps to filter out subscriptions. (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jkg.mypaidapps) Renan L. While it is an alternative, its not exactly the same as having it directly into Play Store. And IIRC, Play Store had this particular option way back in the 3.x releases (the Play Store releases, not the Android ones). salacious I definitely agree. It's only a stop gap solution. I hope Google will add more filtering soon. Renan L. May the Lord of the Bytes take your wise words to the Google's Kingdom! serendipity1002 Quick pic is still a fine and quick, lightweight app, aside from one or two promotional feature from CM that can be turned off, I don't see any reason to discontinue using the app just yet.. Mick Or even better you can use version 4.5.2 which doesn't contain any bloat and spys on you. "If you ask Cheetah CMO Xinhua Liu what Cheetah is, Liu – who quips that the “M” in his CMO title also stands for “monetization” – will say, “We are a data company.” And that’s because the Cheetah gathers quite a lot of data on its users, everything from device ID, language, how often an app is being used, at what time of day it’s being used and when an app is uninstalled." http://adexchanger.com/mobile/cheetah-mobile-hunts-its-next-prey-mobile-monetization/ erptastic Still using a resigned 4.5.2 versionso it does not update. I guess I will simply use that one forever... Rod Same here. M Newman no tab for beta after install of apk. Did ya'll test this before posting this or what? Rita El Khoury "To be clear, neither Artem nor Cody nor I am seeing it on our devices, even after clearing the Play Store's data.

Ananta Gupta I am not able to see after updating to the latest version Doomstang No beta tab for me yet Danzig Yep Rita El Khoury Which version are you running? exadeci I got it today and there is a notable change, the apps that you are on the beta you can only leave private comments to the developer and you can't rate the app. Which I think is pretty neat for users that get the beta without understanding the consequences facse basszus, nálam nincs ilyen. vajon mi lehet a különbség?! :o a legutolsó apk van fent Rod Klingon? Chris Lefebvre No beta tab for me yet. 😞 YETI I don't know how it will function in the end but I think it'd be pretty cool to have an option to beta test per-device, so that if you have 2 devices and one is your daily driver you can beta test on the other Downshifting✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No beta tab for me ahmer afzal no beta tab abqnm I got the beta tab on Friday, but it's still not working fully though.

Sony Xperia Home beta updated with full Google Now integration Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/06/29 10:07am PDTJun 29, 2016 71 Plus 1 on G+ 117 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares188 News Sony Sony isn't making the most compelling Android phones these days, but it does at least try to put out good software. It's one of the most developer-friendly OEMs and it was even the first to release the N preview on non-Nexus hardware. Now, Sony has the distinction of being the first to do something else. The latest version of the Xperia Home beta has a Google Now pane just like the Google Now Launcher—no other OEM has done this on its custom launcher. To give this a shot, you need to have a recent Xperia phone (exact models not listed). It's an open beta that anyone can join by visiting this link from the phone. A toast message will appear at the bottom of the screen to confirm your participation in the beta. The updated home screen should install on your device shortly thereafter. This seems like a weird way to do things, but okay. If you want to leave the beta, you'll have to use this link from the phone. Here's everything Sony says it has changed in the new version. After listening to Beta feedback, search bar in application tray is now transparent. Added notification badge support for Facebook & Facebook messenger. Fixed legacy support for notification badges on Kitkat and Lollipop for Xperia Messaging, Telephony & Email. It is now possible to add Google Now on the -1 pane (enabled from Home Settings). Bug fixes and tweaks The big news here is obviously Google Now on the home screen. Sony's launcher defaults to using the center panel as the "main" one, just like stock Android used to do back in the day. Turning on Google Now in the launcher settings will move your main screen to the left side, then you can swipe left once to access Google Now. It looks and works exactly like it does in the Google Now Launcher. Google hasn't made any tools for Google Now publicly available, which is why no third-party launchers have a Google Now panel. It's not clear if Sony just got something special from Google, or maybe all OEMs have the option of doing this and none of them have bothered yet. Whatever the situation, Sony is the only company to add Google Now support in this way. It's worth checking out if you've got an Xperia.

(HIMYM) Lukas Actually they're not the first. This appeared in trebuchet in cm11. It wasn't perfect, but Google now launcher slower back then. Sashank Narayan That was different. It used the same method that other launchers like Nova and Action use for calling the Google Now screen, the caveat being that there was a slight delay, the transition wasn't smooth and you couldn't slide left to go back to the homescreen, you'd have to use the home button. https://youtu.be/uuSimvcMZuM Christopher Bement All CM's and Action Launcher's solution does is open the Google app. It's literally just a launcher shortcut which is gesture activated in most cases. russjr08 Yeah, that's what he was pointing out. Christopher Bement Indeed, and it needed some clarification which is why I chimed in. Luqmaan Mathee Actually you could slide back to the home screen. It didn't always work, but it did if you tried it a second time. rgao007 So it was a gesture that launched the Google app? Sashank Narayan Yes, the same swipe gesture used in the Google Now Launcher. Except the Google Now panel is integrated in that launcher, so it slides in smoothly, whereas other launchers open the Google app with a noticeable stutter. grizzlyjon83 I really hope we hear more about how this came about. My optimistic side is hopeful that this is the beginning of Google Now being opened up a little bit. ikjadoon Hmm...optimistic, but not so much. Aren't big features like that announced at I/O? Maybe in 2017 or 2018? Adrián Iriarte Very good improvemnt. Dont force to use but make the option available to the user jstew182 The Google Now launcher is also opt in on this function. Roh_Mish Sony has been good about making all changes an option. this will be an option too. MrTheenD Wow Sony, I'm impressed. jcopernicus Google should just replace the whole android team with sony's team. Christopher Bement Don't jump the gun yet, we need to know how their messaging people work. Messenger, Hangouts, Allo, Duo, Gvoice, all of them need a look! Denigrate Why? rgao007 hahahahahahaha NO rgao007 I would love to see this on the HTC launcher. Anonymous Neverevereverever with blinkfeed Kwetsima Maluleke You see now this is what I'd also like to see on TouchWiz. Ankit Gupta I hope Nova gains this functionality soon enough! Eric Braun Hopefully! jstew182 This is the only thing that keeps me from using Nova as my daily launcher. demarcmj Same Protoss because pressing that search bar on top of the launcher to invoke Google Now is too difficult i guess right? Eric Braun Doesn't have to do with a degree of difficulty, more of just the fluidity of being able to swipe. Anonymous It looks super ugly even on trebuchet, the animations and the time for the keyboard to pop up is super intolerable.

Arshdeep Singh Saini Exactly, its exclusive to the Google Now Launcher and the biggest reason to use it. Michael M.

Dibyajyot I am also waiting for that.I am using google now launcher only for Google now tab :( Ygor Cortes Now make this happen on Nova... Yury H Fingers crossed Action Launcher 3 implements this as well :D John Kevin Villar time to decode from sony phones i guess. Dominic81 If you'll get a Xperia, get the latest true great Xperia: the Z5. The Xperia X is a sad joke. Same for the X Performance Damodara Kovie [dkovie] Or Z5 Compact. That's also a great option. I like the smaller form factor. 😊 Hyung-Woo Jung Sad to hear the Xperia X lineup is not up to par with other releases this year. Thankfully I'm very happy with my Z5 Compact. John Kevin Villar sony xperia x line is great! I guess you never have one. haha Dominic81 No it's not. The Xperia X line is a sad joke and the pricing is even worse. Start using your critical thinking and stop hugging Sony's nuts buddy. The X Performance is more expensive than a Galaxy S7 Edge. That doesn't make sense, at all Roberto M.

Hopefully ActionLauncher or Nova will pick this up. Than we will have the "perfect" launcher experience on Android. *_* Portzblitz I agree! "Perfect". I will be a perfect 100% satisfied with my phone & launcher setup for the first time ever if Nova gets to play with this code. *not that I'm exactly miserable right now or anything; I'm actually feeling a pretty happy 99% with Nova 😀 onstrike112 While a cool novelty, I'd disable it, and if I couldn't, I'd switch to a different launcher. I can touch an icon or say "okay Google" if I want Google Now. But choice is the benefit to Android. I can use BlackBerry's launcher on a BlackBerry Priv, just like how anyone could choose any other launcher to use all the same.

I have the same version on my Z3, but I'm not seeing that option. Maybe it's because I'm running the Android N preview? Wolf0491 Well you do need to have Google cards enabled in google now settings I think Gaurav Arora Google make next Nexus with Sony !! Martin Nilsson I use Google's launcher on my N9 and Sony's on my Z3 and now it almost looks and feels the same. Lots can be said about Sony and their phones, but software (and updates) were the reason I got my Xperia. The changes made in this beta just further that point . world Ads Net Amazing federico rebechi I use the swipe up gesture to open it on Nova. Is pretty much the same.

Alexis BenvenisteApr 3, 2017 11:32PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestGIF: Courtesy of GIPHY While the phrase “Netflix and chill” lost its chill factor a while ago, according to 1,100 teenagers, apparently Netflix itself is still pretty “cool.” Google recently surveyed just over a thousand teens for a project that is quite literally titled, “It’s Lit: a guide to what teens think is cool.” In the survey, teens ranging from ages 13 to 17 (Gen Z) as well as young adults ranging from ages 18-24 (Millennials) were asked to rank 122 brands based on “how cool they are.” Google and YouTube, which is owned by the search engine, were both deemed to be among the “most cool” brands, alongside YouTube and Netflix. It also appears that most teens didn’t actually know what Vice was, which worked against the media company’s favor, as the teens deemed it “uncool.” (But to be fair, can you really decide how cool something is if you don’t even know what it is?) Even among friends, what’s “cool” and what’s “uncool” differs, so it seems pretty unfair to have a questionnaire filled out by about 1,000 teens determine what’s in and what’s out for the entire gen Z and millennial generations. Isn’t being different from your friends and classmates part of what makes life interesting? It would be pretty boring if all 13-17-year-olds and all 18-24-year-olds liked the same brands. And of course, just because one group of people decides something is cool, doesn’t mean it’s the rule for the group. For instance, when it comes to favorite foods among millennials, In-N-Out was chosen as a favorite. For gen Z, on the other hand, Chick-Fil-A came in at number 1. We’re pretty sure that plenty of Gen Z prefers In-N-Out—especially if they live on the West Coast—and it’s safe to say that tons of millennials prefer Chick-Fil-A. Here’s another example: Gen Z listed Under Armour to be cooler than Lululemon, but we’re sure you know people who think otherwise. Of course, you should take any survey like this with a grain of salt. Not only is a survey of about a thousand teenagers pretty small, but caving to peer pressure is never a good look. Forget about what’s “cool” and “uncool.” When it comes down to it, if you think something is cool, then it’s cool to you.

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 3, 2017 at 9:09PM The boom in data traffic is creating the need for stronger cloud infrastructure, forcing cloud service providers (CSPs) to upgrade their data centers to process the increasing volume and complexity of data. Gartner estimates that public cloud infrastructure investments will grow almost 37% this year, to $34.6 billion, thanks to investments from Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google to bring their data centers up to speed. One way to tap this multibillion-dollar market is through NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), as its Tesla graphics processing units (GPUs) are helping the CSPs bring raw computing power to their data centers. As it turns out, the chipmaker's data center business has taken off remarkably in recent quarters, outpacing the growth in other key segments. Data Source: NVIDIA. Chart by author. In fact, the data center business is now NVIDIA's second-largest revenue source, and it is likely that it will continue to get bigger given the company's recent moves in this space. NVIDIA is gaining from GPU adoption in the cloud A huge amount of data is being generated thanks to connected cars and other Internet of Things devices. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich believes that a single autonomous car could generate 4,000 gigabytes of data daily if driven for just one hour, thanks to all the sensors and cameras installed. Machina Research, on the other hand, forecasts that the number of connected devices will grow over fourfold, to 27 billion, by 2025. This is going to create a big challenge for CSPs in transferring the data from the cloud to the data center, with Gartner forecasting that 25% of the data generated will go to waste even before it is analyzed. NVIDIA, however, has a solution for the CSPs with its Tesla GPUs that are specifically aimed at this market. Image source: NVIDIA.  The Tesla GPUs accelerate a data center's computing power, enabling service providers to process huge data sets at a fraction of the cost required to build a new facility, which would previously have been required to analyze the same amount of data. NVIDIA does this by allowing service providers to replace central processing units with its high-performance GPUs that can deliver a fivefold boost in computational power and slash costs by 60%. Not surprisingly, Alphabet has decided to use the chipmaker's Tesla K80 GPUs on the Google Cloud Platform to offer deep-learning capabilities to its users. Google Cloud users can now use up to eight GPUs to perform intensive tasks such as high-performance data analysis, seismic analysis, and video transcoding. Google is going to charge $0.70 per hour for each K80 GPU in the U.S. and $0.77 per hour in Asia and Europe, allowing users to carry out deep-learning operations without any significant capital investment. What's more, Tencent has also decided to use NVIDIA's Tesla P100 and P40 GPU accelerators to give artificial intelligence (AI) computing capabilities to its enterprise customers, giving the chipmaker access to China's booming public cloud-infrastructure market. NVIDIA is targeting AI cloud computing AI cloud computing is fast gaining traction thanks to the advent of the Internet of Things and connected cars that require autonomous decision making based on data generated, and NVIDIA does not want to miss the gravy train. The chipmaker recently partnered with Microsoft to bring to market a hyperscale GPU accelerator aimed at AI cloud computing applications. NVIDIA and Microsoft expect their framework -- the HGX-1 -- to be used in healthcare, self-driving cars, and voice recognition, among others, as it is positioned as the standard architecture for AI cloud computing. The HGX-1 is based on an open-source, modular design, indicating that it is scalable in nature since it comes with eight Tesla GPUs that can connect to the central processing unit depending on the workload. NVIDIA has made a smart move by tying up with Microsoft to develop an AI cloud computing solution as the latter's Azure cloud service is growing at a faster pace than the market leader. Amazon Web Services -- the e-commerce giant's cloud computing services subsidiary -- is currently the market leader in this space, but Microsoft's Azure cloud could overtake it in a couple of years according to a Morgan Stanley survey. In all, NVIDIA's data center business has a lot of room for growth as the company's GPUs will play a mission-critical role in cloud computing thanks to the chipmaker's deep-learning and AI capabilities. More important, the company is partnering with the key players to sustain its rapid growth in this space. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

(AAP) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Image 1/ Video Audio A Victorian lawyer has lost his bid to sue Google Australia over unflattering search results, but will continue to chase its US parent company. Source: AAP 4 Apr 2017 - 3:12 PM  UPDATED 1 HOUR AGO Tweet High-profile Melbourne lawyer George Defteros can't sue Google Australia over unflattering search results, but he will continue to chase its US parent company. Mr Defteros tried to sue the Australian arm of the internet giant over articles linked to his time as a lawyer representing Melbourne underworld figures, including Mick Gatto, Alphonse Gangitano and Graham "The Munster" Kinniburgh. However, Justice John Dixon threw the case out of the Victorian Supreme Court on Tuesday after he found it had no real chance of success. Mr Defteros told AAP he will continue to pursue the US-based Google Inc after his claim against Google Australia was tossed out. "This was a decision in relation to a Google subsidiary and the case still remains on foot against Google Inc, who is the main defendant," Mr Defteros told AAP on Tuesday. He argued the first page of Google search results for his name contained material that was professionally and personally defamatory. "The plaintiff has been injured in his personal and professional reputation, and has suffered embarrassment and hurt to his feelings," Mr Defteros argued in his writ. He also argued Google Australia was responsible for the content found by searching his name and that the company should be considered a publisher for the purposes of defamation law. But Justice Dixon said Google Australia had no control over the search engine, which was run by Google Inc in the United States. "(Also) the allegation that Google Australia published the (defamatory online content) has no real prospect of success," Justice Dixon said in his judgment. Justice Dixon also rejected Mr Defteros' concerns about enforcing any potential judgment against Google Inc if the company was found liable in a proceeding. He dismissed Mr Defteros' claims against Google Australia.

Google published “It’s Lit: A guide to what teens think is cool”, a “magazine” compiling the results of its research into Generation Z, characterised as those aged from 13 to 17. The Google-funded research found Generation Z relied on brands to “shape their world”, and that Google was the third-most cool. Cool was defined by the researchers as “unique, impressive, interesting, amazing, or awesome”. YouTube, which Google owns, came out at number one ahead of Netflix. Google’s web browser Chrome placed tenth, in front of Nike. Heraclitus (@DreamboatSlim) This is good. Google has conducted a piece of research which concludes that teens consider a web browser cooler than Nike pic.twitter.com/ZtCH3Wl6gH April 3, 2017 1,100 teenagers aged 13-17 were asked to rank 122 brands by coolness and awareness. YouTube, Google and Netflix ranked highly by both. Luke Bailey (@imbadatlife) Also, fan of the fact about 40 teens looked someone straight in the eye and said, "Google? Never heard of it." pic.twitter.com/JoYnyJSjnb April 3, 2017 According to the surveyed teens, McDonalds, Yahoo and Facebook Messenger were high-profile but not cool. Doritos and Oreo were cool. Vice was not cool. Overall, the least cool brands were TMZ, the Wall Street Journal, Sprint and Yahoo. Respondents were least aware of Uniqlo, Patagonia and Supreme. Mike Bird (@Birdyword) Of hundreds of brands Google asked teens about, they ranked the WSJ least cool. Well kids, the bond market doesn't think you're cool either pic.twitter.com/667VlxxK7K April 3, 2017 But those surveyed for the Google study were united in their appreciation of Google, with Millennials describing it as “serious and functional” and Generation Z finding it more “fun and functional”. A 17-year-old woman in suburban Florida was quoted as saying that Google was “not only a powerful search engine, but great at everything it does, from email to documents”. “Teens love learning and knowing” was researchers’ conclusion. The study stated that 42.2% of Generation Z respondents used its social network Google Plus, putting it ahead of Twitter (35.4%) and Pinterest (26.6%) and only a little over 10% behind Facebook. But the finding betrays the fact that a Google Plus account comes part and parcel with use of its other services such as Gmail. An independent study in 2015 suggested fewer than 1% of Google’s 2.2bn users were active on Google Plus. Responding to the research on social media, many expressed scepticism as to its validity. “This study is a great piece of native advertising for Google services,” tweeted one technology commentator. Many write-ups of the report referenced Steve Buscemi’s appearance on 30 Rock, now a popular meme: “How do you do, fellow kids?” Maya Kosoff (@mekosoff) "how do you do, fellow kids?" - google https://t.co/OpKspXg9vH pic.twitter.com/o11ee59OG4 April 3, 2017 Topics Google Marketing & PR news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech selected arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech selected arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Technology › Google back to top tech US world science US politics business Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photo / AP Google has admitted to a blind spot around extremist content as it revealed it is teaching its computer systems to understand which videos are offensive. Some of the biggest brands in the US have pulled hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising from Google and YouTube after their brands were promoted next to extremist content. Google has now admitted that its computers struggle to "understand context" and said it is using its "greatest machine learning abilities" to try to solve the issue, the Daily Telegraph reports. In an interview with The New York Times Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, said that the company has been in "emergency mode" over the issue of extremist content. "We take this as seriously as we've ever taken a problem," he said. Google is now training its computers to recognise videos that are offensive by analysing them on a frame-by-frame basis and comparing them with descriptions of content. It said it hoped to teach its computers to understand the context of footage, so that videos that are easily recognised by people as offensive will be flagged by its computers. Schindler said: "Computers have a much harder time understanding context, and that's why we're actually using all of our latest and greatest machine learning abilities now to get a better feel for this."

However, the company said that it will never be able to solve the problem completely as 400 hours of new content are uploaded to YouTube every minute. "No system can be 100 per cent perfect," he said. "But we're working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible." More than 250 organisations in the UK including the British Government, Toyota, Tesco and McDonald's stopped UK advertising on YouTube after it emerged that they were being promoted on videos posted by hate preachers, rape apologists and extremists banned in Britain. Google has changed which videos can carry advertising and given them the power to fine-tune the types of content that they want to approve. Last week Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, summoned executives from Google, Twitter, Facebook and Microsoft to a summit at the Home Office after the Westminster terrorist attacks. The companies agreed to create new "technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda". They also agreed to look at "options" for a body "to accelerate" how they take down extremist content. However they were criticised for paying "lip service" to the problem by failing to commit fully to setting up an industry body to tackle the problem.

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

The door have long been blown right open. We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross. Will S. Sweet...They should've thought of this years ago though... JG Google does (or at least did) have a parent share agreement with Samsung and someone else... I wouldn't be opposed to finding or this enhances that and allows OEMs to share features easier. I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel.

Google has started rolling out Android 7.1.2 (Nougat) update for several Nexus and Pixel devices, as expected. Android 7.1.2 beta was released back in January, and as Google had announced earlier, Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 is not getting this update. The update brings several bug fixes, new features, and general performance/stability improvements. Android 7.1.2 includes: Improved fingerprint swipe performance Bluetooth connectivity improvements Battery usage alerts “Some of the other fixes are with the early shutdown issue, a fix for the small number of users experiencing pink banding on the camera, and a fix to the audio popping issue some users were experiencing at high volumes,” said Google.

Republicans in Congress revoked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) privacy rule against strong opposition from Democrats who regard the rule as essential for consumer privacy. Conservatives call the law duplicitous and unnecessary. Republicans and telecom industry groups argue that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), not the FCC, traditionally protected consumer privacy. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER The privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the FCC under the Obama administration. The regulation required internet services providers (ISPs) to protect consumer data more stringently than content providers such as Google and Facebook. The FCC required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using location data, financial information, health, information, and web history for advertising. Breitbart News spoke with Phil Kerpen, president of American Commitment, about his organization’s opposition to the FCC’s broadband privacy rule. Kerpen told Breitbart News that the criticism against removing this regulation is unwarranted. “This is a deliberate disinformation campaign from the usual suspects from the tech-left and the media, and they’re completely misrepresenting the issue, and the conservatives are falling for the fake news narrative,” he told Breitbart News. “Up until 2015, the FTC protected consumer privacy, and then the FCC Net Neutrality order eviscerated the consumer protections at the FTC by pre-empting FTC’s jurisdiction. The FCC then came around and hammered ISP’s with draconian regulations that do not apply to Google or Facebook.” “This is especially concerning, considering they have considerably more access to your personal data than Comcast or Verizon,” Kerpen explained. “It’s insane that Google and Facebook have a near duopoly in the advertising game and they have less stringent rules in terms of what they can do with your private information.” The president of the American Commitment said that Google is trying to rig the system against ISPs. “Google has this whole array of left-leaning groups defending their favorite regulations that put them in their favor,” he claimed. “If you recall Gigi Sohn, the counselor to former Chairman Tom Wheeler, resigned from the FCC and she’s now at the Open Society Institute, and she’s working with George Soros, and they’re pushing a lot of money to these narratives. There’s a reason that former Chairman Wheeler waited until the last possible minute to institute these regulations. They knew these were very easy headlines to write, such as ‘Republicans in Congress Undo Privacy Rules’ specifically to create this distortion campaign to make it harder to get rid of Net Neutrality.” Kerpen added, “This whole fight against the ISPs is a sideshow, by far the biggest threat to consumer privacy is Google that has trackers on over 60 percent of all websites. Google owns YouTube, and they have trackers everywhere, and they’ve shifted the focus of the debate to issues that don’t regulate Google.” Katie McAuliffe, executive director of Digital Liberty, told Breitbart News, “This is nothing more than another Obama-era regulation that needs to be removed.” McAuliffe told Breitbart News that this broadband rule was another power grab by the Obama-era FCC. She said, “Obama’s FCC broadband rule was a power grab under the guise of privacy.” Read More Stories About: Big Government, Tech, Donald Trump, FCC, internet privacy Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

The system will allow them to take bids from multiple buyer pools all at once. Published: April 4, 2017 7:33 AM Mobile publishers have been able to tap demand from Facebook Audience Network. The system will allow them to take bids from multiple buyer pools all at once. Social media leader Facebook has confirmed the integration of header bidding on its platform. Header bidding, which allows mobile web publishers to collect bids and then select the highest offer, and improve upon the original programmatic auctions, has been lauded by publishers. Facebook’s initial partners include Amazon Publisher Services, AppNexus, Index Exchange, Media.net, Sonobi and Sortable. These mobile publishers have been able to tap demand from Facebook Audience Network. The system will allow them to take bids from multiple buyer pools all at once. Due to advance bidding technology, publishers can make more money and earn up to 10-30% more revenues, when compared to programmatic advertising. With this, the cost to buy ads on the mobile web are set to go up as simultaneous bidding grows as all demand sources get the same information at the same time. This, however, experts suggest, will force mobile web prices to go up. Facebook has been testing this platform since August 2016 to counter Google’s ad platforms. Google’s Doubleclick has already adopted header bidding. A BI Intelligence report on header bidding says that nearly 70% of publishers now use header bidding technology. It further states that the technology offers many benefits for publishers and advertisers. “For publishers, header bidding offers a means to optimise yield, cut down on passbacks, increase transparency of inventory value, and eliminate Google’s favouritism for its own ad exchange, AdX. On the buy side, advertisers are given the opportunity to bid on all available inventory and not just remnant inventory like in a waterfall system,” says the report. Facebook says that its tests with publishers such as the Washington Post, Daily Mail and Forbes have shown header bidding through its Audience Network can increase revenue by 10-30%. YouTube faces the music Amidst growing concern over objectionable content on digital platforms, brands are taking all possible steps to guard themselves from appearing next to such content on YouTube and other Google-partnered websites. Havas Group UK recently decided on its clients’ behalf to pull out all of their advertising monies from YouTube and Google. The statement issued by the company said, “Havas Group UK has taken the decision on behalf of its UK clients, which include O2, Royal Mail, BBC, Domino’s and Hyundai Kia, to pause all YouTube and Google Display Network (GDN) investment until further notice.” The objectionable content includes videos promoting extremist content and terrorist organisations such as ISIS on Google-partnered websites near the content from brands. AT&T, Johnson & Johnson and Verizon have also announced that they would refrain from buying both video and text ads. McDonald’s, Walmart, Audi and Toyota are also pulling their ads from Google properties. In a blog post, Philipp Schindler, chief business officer of Google, assured increased brand safety levels and controls for advertisers. He wrote, “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So starting today, we are taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content…We’ll offer advertisers and agencies more transparency and visibility on where their ads are running, and in the coming months we will expand availability of video-level reporting to all advertisers.” 1800 Tequila’s new video wins Hands down Building further on 1800’s strong relationship with the hip-hop community, the new ad from the brand called Hands establishes the tequila as the drink of choice for modern boundary-pushers. The film, which is garnering steam online, features a man who practices in a boxing ring during the day and plays piano in the nights at a jazz establishment.  The high-energy soundtrack Tap Dance from Octave Minds features Chance the Rapper who has given two verses to Hands. The new positioning, which goes with the tagline Just Refined Enough, tries to break through much abused liquor stereotypes and aims “to spark a new conversation about the multi-dimensional nature of modern masculinity”, according to the brand.  Created by CP+BLA, our protagonist in the ad — one-part pianist, one-part boxer — is shown approaching both tasks with  equal enthusiasm. Over the years, through partnerships with Billboard, 1800 has worked with various notable hip-hop artists including Rae Sremmurd, Travis Scott, Wale, Mike WiLL Made-It, etc. The aim of the brand has been to trace an artists’ roots and shed light on urban lifestyles. The latest viral by 1800 Tequila definitely hits the right notes with its protagonist and soundtrack matching up to the brand’s philosophy.

If it does, it will be for the first time since 2012. The Advertising Expenditure Forecast further says that London currently is the fourth biggest city globally, following New York, Tokyo and Los Angeles, for ad spends. It contributed £5.2 billion in 2017. The forecast also says that 2017 will see internet advertising attracting more monies than traditional TV advertising and newspaper advertising will be overshadowed by social media advertising. The report said that TV spends in the UK will shrink in the first quarter of 2017, due to decline in retail spends by 15% and drop in FMCG advertising by 12%. For 2017, the forecast predicts, global internet advertising expenditure will grow 13% to reach $205 billion. Internet advertising will attract 36.9% of all advertising expenditure, up from 34% in 2016, totalling $192 billion. “Internet advertising has contributed all of the growth in global ad spend since the beginning of the decade, and has stimulated much of the innovation we have seen in the market,” said Vittorio Bonori, Zenith’s global brand president. “Innovation is proceeding as fast as ever, and we believe that this is what will continue to drive brand growth for advertisers.” Gucci’s memes for digital world Gucci recently owned the meme landscape in the virtual world with #TFWGucci to launch its new watch collection, Le Marché des Merveilles. The brand commissioned international artists to develop original imagery which were then given to famous viral creators on Twitter and Instagram to turn into new memes for its timepieces. The results, which became a collection of the brand’s captioned art, were met with awe and criticism in equal measure. “Adapted from a popular meme, That Feeling When Gucci is about the moment of putting on one of the watches, when the world suddenly becomes different and time slows down a little bit,” announced the brand on its microsite. One of the most viral memes to garner over 80,000 likes, it was inspired by the Arthur meme. — Compiled by Ananya Saha Please Wait while comments are loading...

Google Releases Full Factory OS Image For The Nexus 7 "nakasi" Tablet (Android 4.1, JRN84D) Artem Russakovskii Follow View All Posts 2012/06/29 5:12pm PDTJun 29, 2012 54 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 70 Share on Twitter Total Shares77 ASUS Development Google Jelly Bean 4.1/4.2/4.3 News Nexus 7 Google just dropped the full OS image for the recently announced at Google I/O Nexus 7 tablet. The image allows you to restore the tablet back to full stock Android 4.1 (build JRN84D) in case something goes wrong. This way, developers can tweak its internals without fearing a brick and users can always go back to something stable if a flash goes awry. There are no surprises here - the Nexus 7 is a true Nexus device after all. Great job publishing the image promptly, Google! It's interesting to note that the page name switched from "Factory Images for Nexus Phones" to "Factory Images for Nexus Devices" which made me realize and allow to sink in yet again just what exactly happened in the last 3 days. Here's another interesting bit you probably haven't seen before - the Nexus 7's codename is "nakasi." Unlike the fishy variety that Google used with the Nexus phones, Nakasi is actually a music form. Can we expect to see its similarly named big, say, 10", brother sometime soon? If so, does anyone have any good codename guesses? Download To download, head over to the Factory Images page and scroll down to "nakasi."

Bojan Gutic Nope. Bloodflame87 Not in it's current state, but it is possible for it to be ported by some talented developers. The likeliness isn't high though. Once the AOSP source drops in mid-July, there's a much better chance of the Transformer Prime getting JB Jaymoon Great observation... But what caught my eye even more is that 4.0.4 was put up for toro (CDMA).  Wouldn't have figured Google would still continue for the CDMA devices, since they are "archived, for reference only".  Good to know even the archives will still be updated. Tyler Chappell Ditto, this is extremely good news. Hopefully Verizon Nexus owners won't have to wait another 6 months for Jelly Bean like they did for 4.0.4. Seeing as how current JB ports to the Verizon GNex are still not quite there. But that won't take long for the dev community considering how much they have already accomplished, so I am saying this in terms of those who don't root there Nexus. I got my dad's rooted so I expect I'll have him on a 100% functional and equally stable ROM before the end of July. Ole Jakob Hegelund Cannot wait until 4.1 comes to my Nexus S!! :D Shawn Alty actually, nakasi is the name in the sense that yakju/takju/mysid are the Galaxy Nexii... same with soju/sojus and the Nexus S and passion for the Nexus One. it's board name is "grouper" which is just as much a fish as all the previous ones have been (tuna for GN, herring for NS, mahimahi for N1, trout for G1, and goldfish for the emulator). not sure what the name of the Nexus Q is though, but most likely Google will keep this up fixxmyhead Mind blown but probably cuz im stoned. Damn bro u went all into details that nakasi was some kind of fish thing. Nice this guy knows his shit here Zexcceed its no longer there. how else can i find it ?

It was more of a maintenance release, with Google’s Android VP of Engineering mentioning that it was more or less focused on refinements. The second beta landed at the end of March, one day before Google officially announced the Android O Developer Preview was available for download. With our sights now set firmly on Android O, some may have forgotten all about Android 7.1.2, but it seems the final version is now ready to rollout to Nexus and Pixel devices starting today. This is according to the official thread Google posted in r/GooglePixel. Here’s the list of changes for anyone curious: Improved fingerprint swipe performance Additional improvements/fixes for the audio popping issue some users were experiencing while playing audio at high volumes Bluetooth connectivity improvements Fix to the early shutdown issue Battery usage alerts Fix to the pink banding issue a small number of users were experiencing on the camera You can manually download the official OTA images here, or download the factory images here. Of course, you can always wait for the update to hit your Nexus or Pixel if you don’t mind waiting, just don’t expect anything for the Nexus 6 or 9.

Erica’s school, Scoil Carmel Junior School will also receive a €10,000 technology grant while her teacher Ms Lea will also receive a Chromebook.

Erica’s winningdoodle, was designed by Erica to be her companion. She explained, “I designed a happy robot called Tom to help with my chores and be my friend. Tom is always happy and loves to play games with me. "I gave him multi-coloured legs because I love rainbows. I used all the letters from Google as parts of my robot, the G’s are ears, the O’s are eyes and the L and E are my robots power switches connected with curly cables.” Read More 5,000 runners take part in Port Tunnel race in aid of Focus Ireland Speaking at the Grand Final, Fionnuala Meehan, VP and head of Google Ireland said, “It’s been a fantastic year for the our Doodle 4 Google competition, which continues to grow every year.

Julie188 writes: When Google shows up to buy your startup and trade out your relatively worthless startup stock for Google stock, and offers you a high paying job, too, it seems like a dream come true. But for a group of ex-military guys at a startup called Titan Aerospace, it was more like a nightmare, according to a detailed article from Business Insider. After Google buys their company, it shuts it down, gets them to move across the country to California and then sets them up working long hours outdoors in 100-degree heat. One older guy, in his mid-50s, was even hospitalized, and when he returned to work, he was essentially pushed out. Some people claimed it was bias against older workers and veterans. business google googlex ← You may like to read: → Bitcoin Becomes Legal Payment Option In Japan, Prices Spike Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Ask Slashdot: Would You Recommend Updating To Windows 10?

I was recruited for a dev position around 2007. I was pretty active in several Open Source projects and with one of the major community Linux distros. I had a pretty solid body of work that was publicly visible. Once I submitted my resume, the interaction changed somewhat. I was in the military about 10 years at the time, so in addition to my Open Source activities, I had quite a few years of military experience. When they thought I was just an Open Source dev (perhaps thinking that my day job was for some small mom & pop company), the recruiter was always eager to communicate with me. However, after they got my resume, they seemed less eager. I don't think it was age (I wasn't 30 yet), but perhaps being a military veteran had something to do with it. Perhaps they thought I would expect a higher salary based on my experience/education (I had earned my MS in Computer Engineering shortly prior). Who knows. Either way, I've known some folks who have worked at Google and other SV companies. Looking at where I am now I feel like I dodged a bullet, so it's all good.

The move come as the internet colossus scrambles to derail an advertising boycott of Google’s money-making engine. Google said it was using new machine-learning or artificial intelligence systems to enforce its policies, to help content objectionable to advertisers. These systems will be adapted to advertiser preferences, Google said. The tech giant also said it would work with third parties to help advertisers protect their brands from unwanted placement. “As part of our commitment to provide even more transparency and visibility to our advertising partners, we’ll be working with trusted vendors to provide third-party brand safety reporting on YouTube,” a Google spokesperson said yesterday. Google chief business officer Phillip Schindler recently apologised and said the company was taking a “tougher stance” on hateful, offensive, or derogatory content while ramping up safeguards to make sure ads only appear with acceptable material from legitimate creators. Google has continued to downplay the effect of the boycott. California-based Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw ads fearing placement alongside extremist content, has introduced new tools to give firms greater control. The boycott began in February after the Times newspaper of London found BBC programmes were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from Britain for inciting hatred. The analysis found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google had failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the European Union after it anonymously signaled their presence. The British government subsequently put its YouTube advertising on hold, saying in a statement, “it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content.” Others to pull the plug included the BBC, The Guardian newspaper group, McDonalds UK and the British arm of the major advertising agency Havas. The movement spread to the United States, with AT&T and Verizon pulling ads from Google. A solution may not be easy. Google needs to strike a balance between pleasing advertisers and those who upload videos to YouTube and are free to take their creations elsewhere if unsatisfied with their shares of ad revenue. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Machine learning may fix ad placement dispute, says Google AOL plus Yahoo to equal new Oath Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Find the stations with the cheapest petrol with MyPetrol app China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Lazada launches ‘Lovezada’ dating app (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan suspend YouTube ads over offensive videos (VIDEO) AT&T, Verizon join Google ad boycott Google apologises to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco Facebook tunes trending topics to better deliver news Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Credit: University of Washington The UW electrical engineering research team that figured out how to deceive Google's Video Intelligence API includes Baicen Xiao, Radha Poovendran and Hossein Hosseini Web version posted here: http://www.washington.edu/news/2017/04/03/uw-security-researchers-show-that-googles-ai-tool-for-video-searching-can-be-easily-deceived/ FROM: Jennifer Langston University of Washington 206-543-2580 jlangst@uw.edu (NOTE: researcher contact information at end) For Immediate Release April 3, 2017 Google’s AI tool for video searches can be easily deceived Newswise — University of Washington researchers have shown that Google's new tool that uses machine learning to automatically analyze and label video content can be deceived by inserting a photograph periodically and at a very low rate into videos. After they inserted an image of a car into a video about animals, for instance, the system returned results suggesting the video was about an Audi. Google recently released its Cloud Video Intelligence API to help developers build applications that can automatically recognize objects and search for content within videos. Automated video annotation would be a breakthrough technology, helping law enforcement efficiently search surveillance videos, sports fans instantly find the moment a goal was scored or video hosting sites weed out inappropriate content. Google launched a demonstration website that allows anyone to select a video for annotation. The API quickly identifies the key objects within the video, detects scene changes and provides shot labels of the video events over time. The API website says the system can be used to "separate signal from noise, by retrieving relevant information at the video, shot or per frame" level. In a new research paper, the UW electrical engineers and security researchers, including doctoral students Hossein Hosseini and Baicen Xiao and professor Radha Poovendran, demonstrated that the API can be deceived by slightly manipulating the videos. They showed one can subtly modify the video by inserting an image into it, so that the system returns only the labels related to the inserted image. The same research team recently showed that Google's machine-learning-based platform designed to identify and weed out comments from internet trolls can be easily deceived by typos, misspelling offensive words or adding unnecessary punctuation. "Machine learning systems are generally designed to yield the best performance in benign settings. But in real-world applications, these systems are susceptible to intelligent subversion or attacks," said senior author Radha Poovendran, chair of the UW electrical engineering department and director of the Network Security Lab. "Designing systems that are robust and resilient to adversaries is critical as we move forward in adopting the AI products in everyday applications." As an example, a screenshot of the API's output in Figure 1 for a sample video named "animals.mp4," which is provided by the API website. Google's tool does indeed accurately identify the video labels. The researchers then inserted an image of an Audi car (shown in Figure 2) into the video once every two seconds. The modification is hardly visible, since the image is added once every 50 video frames, for a frame rate of 25. Figure 3 shows a screenshot of the API's output for the manipulated video. As seen below, the Google tool believes with high confidence that the manipulated video is all about the car. "Such vulnerability of the video annotation system seriously undermines its usability in real-world applications," said lead author and UW electrical engineering doctoral student Hossein Hosseini. "It's important to design the system such that it works equally well in adversarial scenarios." "Our Network Security Lab research typically works on the foundations and science of cybersecurity," said Poovendran, the lead principal investigator of a recently awarded MURI grant, where adversarial machine learning is a significant component. "But our focus also includes developing robust and resilient systems for machine learning and reasoning systems that need to operate in adversarial environments for a wide range of applications." ### The research is funded by the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research and Army Research Office.

By JackNicas TimHiggins Google Inc. accused its former driverless-car executive Anthony Levandowski of quietly developing a competing company for more than three years before he left the internet giant and eventually sold the business to Uber Technologies Inc., according to legal documents released Monday. The documents also reveal Levandowski earned more than $120 million at Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG, +1.08% GOOGL, +1.06%   Google “for his supposed contributions” to develop the company’s self-driving car program, now called Waymo. The court filings shed new light on an alleged scheme by Levandowski and other former Google employees to steal technology that is at the center of a seven-week-old federal court battle between Uber and Waymo. Waymo sued Uber in February for allegedly stealing trade secrets to jumpstart its own self-driving-car program last year.

Earth Enterprise was Google's product for businesses that wanted to create their own private geospatial apps rather than use Google Earth and Maps. The commercial service was shut down last month.  Developers will now be able to use Google Earth Enterprise to develop apps to manage geospatial datasets.  The announcement of the move to open source means that Google Earth Enterprise Fusion, Server and Portable Server are all now available on GitHub under the Apache 2 license. Some parts of the original commercial product, specifically the Enterprise Client, Google Maps JavaScript API V3, and the Google Earth API, are not being open sourced. Google is continuing work on the Enterprise Client.     The move to open source seems partially to have been prompted by the continued use of Google Earth Enterprise by existing customers. The decision to discontinue Google Earth Enterprise was made back in 2015, when Google stopped charging customers for its use, and made Google Earth Pro free. Google expected customers would move to alternative products, but many have continued to use the free version. The hope seems to be that customers will at least move their data and apps to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but this isn't a requirement. Google says: "For many customers, GCP provides a scalable and affordable infrastructure as a service where they can securely run GEE. Other GEE customers will be able to continue to operate the software in disconnected environments. However, we believe that the advantages of incorporating even some of the workloads on GCP will become apparent (such as processing large imagery or terrain assets on GCP that can be downloaded and brought to internal networks, or standing up user-facing Portable Globe Factories)." Google says it will also be sharing a series of white papers and other technical resources to make it: "as frictionless as possible to get open source GEE up and running on Google Cloud Platform." Regarding the open source software, Google says that: "Since GEE Fusion and GEE Server are being open-sourced, the imagery and terrain quadtree implementations used in these products will allow third-party developers to build viewers that can consume GEE Server Databases."     More Information Google Earth Enterprise Site Related Articles  SDK for Bing Spatial Data Services           Bing Maps for Metro Style Apps     Getting Started With Google Earth Getting started with Google Maps JavaScript KML in Google Maps and Earth Inside the KML Placemark Excel to KML - a VBA program An Interactive Google Earth KML Editor  Getting started wth Bing Maps (Virtual Earth)  Where are you from?

Free land in OpenSim VR Headsets VR QR Codes Columns / VR & AR 1  Print This Post   •    Email This Post   •   App lets you configure your VR viewer by David Kariuki · March 28, 2017 Google Cardboard-compatible viewers are a great choice for people who want to experience VR but don’t want to shell out the hundreds of dollars that the big-name headsets cost. In fact, these viewers can start at just $5, and are pretty good for watching VR videos and playing casual games. Plus, they work on most late-model smartphone, so you don’t need a new computer or lots of wires. Check out our list of 10 best VR viewers under $100 and 10 super-cheap viewers for trying out VR. However, one big problem with many of these viewers is that the smartphone has to know what lenses the viewer has, and how they’re positioned. Since the viewers are dumb — they’re just lenses in a plastic or cardboard case — you normally do this by scanning a Google Cardboard QR Code. And many manufacturers don’t provide that QR Code. Maybe they’re lazy, or maybe they want you to just use their app, and not any of the thousands of other VR apps in the app stores. This is what a Google Cardboard QR Code looks like. Note the outline of a VR viewer in the center. Whatever the reason, this is a big headache. We have a list of QR Codes here, but we don’t have a QR Code for every single headset out there. Plus, new ones keep popping up all the time. What to do? You can randomly try other codes to see if they’re close enough. Or you can use Google’s own QR Code generator, though it’s a little tricky. But now, there’s a new, easier option. Sites in VR is a virtual tourism app, but it also comes with its own QR Code generator. I tried it out, and found it relatively easy to use and quick to configure my own VR viewer, Play VR. It wasn’t instant and automatic. It took about ten minutes total, and I had to customize the inner and outer distortion, field of view, chromatic aberration, lens separation distance, screen to lens distance, and the interpupil distance. But once I was done, I had the perfect QR Code for my headset. I configured the PlayVR viewer using the Sites in VR application. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) Plus, the app already comes with a selection of ready-to-go QR Codes, in case your viewer is  the official Google Cardboard headset, or a Daydream View, SmartVR, Virtual Vizor,  Homido, Homido Mini, Dscvr,VR Fold, Wearality Sky, Vrizzmo Revolt, Mattel View-Master VR, Merge VR, Durovis Dive 5, ColorCross VR, Soyan, Geeach, Gear VR, Cardboard V2, Bobo VR Z4, Ant VR, Baofeng Small Mojing, Baofeng Storm II, VR Box, Leap-HD or Ritech 3D. (And even if your viewer isn’t one of those, sometimes one of the other QR Codes works well enough, anyway.) How to create your own custom QR Code with the app If your viewer isn’t on their list, and you want to create your own QR Code from scratch, start by downloading the app for free on the Apple or Android app store. Then touch the little icon of a viewer, then on the “viewer settings” icon.   Now you should be at a screen that lets you adjust all the techie configuration settings for your customer viewer. That includes the distortion, field of view, lens separation distance and the interpupil distance. You can also use this to modify the settings for a QR Code that was provided by the manufacturer, but doesn’t look right to you because either the manufacturer made a mistake, or it doesn’t work with your particular smartphone for some reason, or if you have weird eyes. The custom viewer settings screen of the Sites in VR app.   I tried out the process of adjusting for field of view and other features, following the online instructions. I recommend starting with the ruler setting. This allows you to set the screen size. You will need to go and find an actual ruler for this one. If you don’t have a ruler, you can set it for your phone’s official screen size, but be warned that the official specs might not be exact, and, as a result, the virtual reality view that you get might be slightly off. This is the ruler calibration screen. Put an actual ruler on top of your phone, and use the arrows until the the screen’s rulers match your own. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) For all the other settings, your phone will switch to a virtual reality view. To calibrate those settings properly, put the phone inside your virtual reality headset, then move your head until the picture looks right. Then hold your head still for a couple of seconds to save — you will see a little indicator, a circle filling, that will show you that it’s saving. Customizing for inner distortion. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.)     When at the main settings menu, go to a new setting by looking in the direction of the icon — a little blue circle will appear to help you with the selection — and pause until it activates. Then you go back to the viewer settings screen, but this time in virtual reality mode, so you can configure the other settings without taking your phone out of the headset. Here is the custom viewer settings screen in virtual reality, side-by-side view. You can see the little blue circle that is the selection cursor floating just above the “Field of View” settings button. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) It seems to switch into that mode automatically — if you need to switch back out to the regular phone view, take the phone out of the viewer, touch the screen, then touch the little cardboard viewer icon at the bottom of the screen. To go back to the virtual reality mode, just select any calibration setting again. Now you can work your way through all the other settings. Adjusting the lens separation distance. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) The lens separation distance is how far your viewer’s lenses are from one another. Again, tilt your head up and down until the picture looks good to you, then pause to save. Normally, if you were creating a custom viewer code manually with the official Google viewer profile generator tool, you would need an actual ruler or calipers to measure this. So the Sites in VR app is a big time saver here. Adjusting for screen to lens distance. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) All in all, it took me about ten minutes to get through everything and create a working viewer profile. To see whether you’re done, click on the “Test View” button and you can see a little preview of what it all looks together once it’s put together. To go back to your settings selection screen, look for the little gray circle with a square inside of it — that’s the “back” button in this app — and look at it to activate it. The Test Room screen of the Sites in VR app. Once you’re all set, you can go try out your new custom viewer settings in another VR app. Once you’ve set up your custom viewer, your phone will remember it until you change it. You can also check out the rest of Sites in VR app itself, since the main purpose of this app is virtual tourism. The viewer calibration feature is just an added bonus. Select the destinations according to country, city or desired group of attractions such as nature or museums. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) Sites in VR has about 1,700 tourism destinations from around the world, grouped by country, city or type of destination. Bursa New Thermal Spring bath in Turkey.

The autonomous vehicle unit, now called Waymo, claimed in an arbitration demand against the former employee, Anthony Levandowski, that he breached his contract by recruiting from its ranks for his rival company, Otto, -- while collecting more than $120 million in incentive payments from the search giant. Anthony Levandowski Photographer: Angelo Merendino/AFP via Getty Images Waymo and Levandowski’s current employer Uber Technologies Inc. are locked in a contentious legal battle over autonomous vehicle technology. The ride-hailing company is trying to persuade a court that Waymo’s February lawsuit should be resolved in private arbitration. Waymo had earlier filed an arbitration action against Levandowski. Google’s self-driving car project had initially structured its compensation to create specific incentives for the robotics engineers working on the futuristic technology. As the project progressed and evolved into a potential business capable of upending transportation, several early team members got huge payments, as Bloomberg News earlier reported. Uber and Waymo representatives declined to comment on Monday, and Levandowski didn’t respond to a request for comment. Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

Sign Up Google also alleged that, in addition to Otto, Levandowski helped found two other companies developing laser-based sensor technology that ran afoul of his non-compete agreement with the search giant. Odin Wave LLC and Tyto Lidar LLC were merged by February 2014 and Levandowski had been involved in Odin Wave since at least the previous year, when he was also developing competing technology for Google, according to the legal filing. Google at one stage investigated acquiring the merged company, which was run under the Tyto moniker, and Levandowski took part in that process without disclosing any role at the company, Google said. By May 2016, Tyto had been folded into Otto. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

He misses and it’s North Carolina ball. They’ll milk as much time off the clock as they can. Hicks drives on Williams and scores in the paint!

Johnathan Williams hits a three-pointer that cuts the Tar Heels lead to 58-57 ... but then Zach Collins is whistled for a foul, his fifth, and he’s been disqualified with 5.03 remaining. Oh dear. Tony Bradley splits a pair from the line to give Carolina a 59-57 lead, but then Gonzaga’s Nigel Williams-Goss bangs a three-pointer and the Bulldogs are ahead at 60-59!

Updated at 11.29pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.18pm EDT 23:18 Gonzaga 52-54 North Carolina; 7.21, second half The crowd is getting frustrated as the referees have decided to turn the second half of the national championship game into a disciplinary showcase. They’ve whistled 16 fouls in the first nine minutes of the half, though Gonzaga and UNC aren’t doing much to salvage matters from an aesthetic standpoint by missing a combined 22 of 31 shots. The teams trade a few free throws, I guess. Now the referees are calling fouls and reviewing their own bad calls. This is bad. And quite disappointing after the high quality of the first half. Karnowski sinks a pair of foul shots to make it 52-all, before a Tony Bradley lay-up gives North Carolina the lead heading into the under-eight timeout. Gonzaga is 3-for-19 in the second half and all three of their bigs – Collins, Williams and Karnowski – and somehow they’re only trailing by two points. It’s not only the fans who are sick of the officiating. LeBron James (@KingJames) Man I can't watch this anymore man! I would like to see the kids decide who wins the game! I mean Bruh!!

Here’s Przemek Karnowski, who makes a lay-up on a Killian Tillie assist while being fouled. He misses the foul shot, but now he’s opened his account and Gonzaga lead by three. The Zags they let UNC get out in transition and Pinson deposits a quick lay-up that snaps a four-minute scoring drought and a run of eight unanswered points for the Bulldogs. Perkins, who’s gone cold, misses a three and Hicks makes a jumper that gives North Carolina the lead at 44-43. Now a half-court set for the Zags and they post up Karnowski, who fights through the double team and is fouled but makes both foul shots. Then the Heels respond with a three-pointer from Berry, opening a 47-45 lead. UNC had missed 11 shots in a row from three-point range before that shot following their 2-for-6 start. Williams-Goss splits a pair from the line ahead of the under-12 timeout, but Gonzaga will need to improve their 20% shooting percentage this half to have any hope of winning.

Another Justin Jackson missed jumper and now Jordan Mathews cans a three-pointer on a Josh Perkins assist and Gonzaga have the lead again! Six quick ones for the Bulldogs, who are back in business. But right before the under-16 timeout ... Zach Collins picks up his fourth foul. And the replay confirms that it’s a pretty terrible call.

Now Meeks scores on a nifty pick and roll and North Carolina lead by three. Another miss by Williams-Goss and Berry scores on a jumper in transition. Eight unanswered points out of the gate for Carolina and Mark Few calls a timeout. The Heels have ratcheted up the defensive pressure in the second half, especially on the perimeter. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs have let the Heels get out in transition after doing such a good job bottling them up in the first half. Need to get it sorted out. And quickly. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.32pm EDT 22:32 Gonzaga’s 7ft 1in center Przemek Karnowski has struggled in the first half. He’s missed all four of his shots, committing three turnovers and going to the bench early with two fouls. But they’ve gotten more than expected from sophomore guard Josh Perkins, whose game-high 13 points is well over his season average of 8.0 points per game. The Bulldogs have done a great job of limiting Carolina in transition and dominating the offensive glass to limit their second-chance opportunities. They’ve used their size to keep the Tar Heels out of the paint and forced them into a half-court jump-shooting team. The strategy is paying off: ESPN reports that North Carolina is 3-of-18 for 11 points on possessions in which it doesn’t get a paint touch. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.21pm EDT 22:21 A look at the half-time statistics.

He makes both foul shots. UNC rushes down the floor and Berry lofts a three than rims out. Gonzaga will head to the locker room with a three-point lead after limiting UNC to 31.4% shooting in the first half – a scant 20 minutes from the school’s first national championship in any sport. NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) Mark Few says Gonzaga will keep going to Karnowski (0-for-4) and hope some of those shots start to fall. #NationalChampionship pic.twitter.com/2hnfsdNOPI April 4, 2017 Updated at 10.22pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.07pm EDT 22:07 Gonzaga 33-32 North Carolina; 0.12, first half Gonzaga with a 22-16 advantage in rebounding. North Carolina was only outrebounded in three games this year and they lost all of them. Hicks makes a pair from the line to close it to 28-23, but Johnathan Williams answers with a bucket for 30-23. A Hicks jumper off a Bradley assist makes it 30-25. UNC’s Berry then is fouled while shooting a three and makes all three free throws to close it to 30-28, but Nigel Williams-Goss answers with a three-pointer to open it to 33-28. A Meeks lay-up and a pair of Pinson free throws closes Gonzaga’s lead to 33-32 as the seconds tick down on the first half – and Bulldogs coach Mark Few will call a time-out to set up one final play before half-time.

Another miss by Carolina and the Bulldogs have a great look for a three that would extend it to double digits but it misses the target. Gonzaga then miss yet another wide-open look. The Heels are having trouble keeping up with Gonzaga’s players on the perimeter but the Bulldogs miss a pair of chances to make them pay. The Heels are shooting a frigid 33% from the floor and just hanging on, but now Joel Berry hits a much-needed three while getting fouled. He misses the foul shot and chance for a four-point play, but Gonzaga miss on their turn and UNC answer with a Jackson jumper for 21-19.

UNC’s Tony Bradley makes it 10-all on a lay-up. A couple of Gonzaga baskets give the Bulldogs their biggest lead of the day at four, but North Carolina tie it up at 14-all on buckets from Jackson and Britt. Eleven baskets by 11 different players! Up-and-down, wide open basketball played at a fast tempo. This is great stuff in the early going! Now Gonzaga is pushing the tempo. Nigel Williams-Goss makes a jumper and Josh Perkins bangs a three after a Carolina miss.

Gonzaga’s Perkins makes a pair of free throws, but a Kennedy Meeks jumper makes it 4-2 to Carolina. Another Gonzaga miss and UNC’s Isaiah Hicks is fouled while shooting and splits a pair for 5-2. Carolina is clearly trying to run the offense through Hicks to try and shake him from his slump. Few makes the first substitution, going back to the two-center lineup with Karnowski and Collins that worked so well against South Carolina in the semis. Perkins makes a three pointer to give Gonzaga their first lead of the game at 7-5, but Carolina answers with a three from Berry and North Carolina leads 8-7 at the under-16 timeout.

This one is truly a dandy. Gonzaga will be looking for their first ever team national championship in school history in any sport, while North Carolina will be looking for their 48th. Some other fun facts and newsy notes: The distance between Gonzaga’s campus in Spokane and UNC’s campus in Chapel Hill is 2,567 miles. That is the farthest distance between opponents in a national title game since 1971 when UCLA faced off with Villanova, two schools with 2,713 miles between them. Gonzaga will attempt to become the first school from the Pacific time zone to win a national title since Arizona in 1997. Arizona is in the Pacific time zone from March to November. North Carolina has advanced to the national championship game for the second tournament in a row. (Who could forget how they lost in last year’s final?) The last team to play in two straight title games was Butler in 2010 and 2011. The Tar Heels played in back-to-back national title games in 1981 and 1982, losing to Indiana in the first and beating Georgetown in the second. The Tar Heels are the eighth team to reach the title game after finishing runner-up the previous season. The last to win was Kentucky in 1998. The last time a team with at least five national titles in men’s basketball played for the championship against a team with zero titles was 2006, when Florida (the team with zero titles) beat UCLA. Additionally, the last time a team with at least five national titles faced a team that had never even been to the national championship game was 2002, when Maryland (the team that had never even made the title game) beat Indiana.

Phillip/AP Updated at 8.54pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.24pm EDT 20:24 Welcome to tonight’s national championship game between the Gonzaga Bulldogs and the University of North Carolina Tar Heels. The NCAA tournament tipped off three weeks ago with 68 teams. Sixty-six games later, we’re down to the final two. And what a delicious matchup awaits between teams with impressive yet highly dissimilar pedigrees. North Carolina are playing in the championship game for an 11th time and looking for their fifth national title after previous wins in 1957, 1982, 1993, 2005 and 2009. The No1 seed in the South region made it to tonight’s final with a 103-64 win over No16 seed Texas Southern, a 72-65 win over No8 seed Arkansas, a 92-80 win over No4 seed Butler, a 75-73 win over No2 seed Kentucky and a 77-76 win over No3 seed Oregon in Saturday’s national semi-finals. Gonzaga are making their first ever appearance in the title game, having never made it to the Final Four before this year despite their ongoing streak of 19 consecutive tournament appearances, a spell that’s included eight trips to the Sweet 16 and three Elite Eight runs. The tiny Catholic school from Spokane is the first West Coast Conference team to play in the Final Four since Bill Russell’s San Francisco side in 1957 – and the first team from the state of Washington to make it here since Seattle University in 1958. The No1 seed in the West region made it here with a 66-46 win over No16 seed South Dakota State, a 79-73 win over No8 seed Northwestern, a 61-58 win over No4 seed West Virginia, an 83-59 win over No11 seed Xavier and a 77-73 win over No7 seed South Carolina on Saturday night. They’ll meet tonight at University of Phoenix stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Tip off is 6.19pm local time (9.19pm ET and 2.16am BST) or roughly an hour from now. Plenty more to come between now and then. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.26pm EDT 18:26 Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s a look at how the Associated Press sees tonight’s national title game: Two No1 seeds, one in its first Final Four, the other a perennial contender, will meet for the NCAA national championship and it could be quite a brawl. When Gonzaga (37-1) meets North Carolina (32-7) Monday night, it’s a matchup of marauding big men in the middle and deep rosters. “They’re big just like us and they match up with us pretty well,” North Carolina’s Theo Pinson said. “Their guards are really good. We just got to play the game and execute.” The centers are beastly. Gonzaga brings 7ft 1in, 300lb Przemek Karnowski. He will have 3in and 40lbs on the Tar Heels’ 6ft 10in, 260lb Kennedy Meeks, who may have had the best game of his career in Saturday night’s 77-76 win over Oregon. Meeks matched his career high with 25 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, the last to preserve the victory after the last of North Carolina’s four missed free throws in the final 6 seconds. “Kennedy, I thought, was awesome,” Tar Heels coach Roy Williams said. “I thought he controlled everything inside – 25 points, 14 rebounds, 11 of 13 (shooting).” Karnowski will be a load, as he is with every opponent. He was one of the main reasons that Gonzaga regrouped after blowing a 14-point second half lead to beat South Carolina 77-73. But the Zags also have 7ft, 230lb Zach Collins, whose 3-pointer gave Gonzaga the lead. Collins had 14 points, 13 rebounds and six blocked shots to help propel Gonzaga – in its first Final Four – into the title game. “I’m really happy for him,” Karnowski said. “His work ethic is awesome. He’s been playing well for us the entire season. Whenever I go to the bench he gets in, and basically our team doesn’t drop a bit. So he’s been huge for us.” North Carolina, the No1 seed in the South, will be seeking its fifth national title. Gonzaga, the No. 1 seed in the West, finally has made it after knocking on the door so many times under coach Mark Few. “I’ve had some really, really tough teams,” Few said. “I’ve had some really close teams. I’ve had some teams that have been crazy efficient on the offensive end and ones that have been pretty darned good on the defensive end that probably didn’t get credit for it. These guys are all of that. All of it.” North Carolina comes at opponents in waves, and Williams – in search of his third NCAA crown, has a veteran bunch. He starts two seniors and three juniors. Gonzaga doesn’t generally get one-and-done elite stars, so it’s an experienced group, too – two seniors, two juniors and a redshirt sophomore. In many ways it’s a throwback to those days when the best of the best would stick around in college for a little while.

It is introducing a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service, while expanding its definitions of offensive content. A slew of major marketers halted spending on YouTube and Google’s digital ad network after ads were highlighted running alongside videos promoting hate, violence and racism. Google’s initial response, a promise of new controls for marketers, failed to stymie the boycott. The crisis ignited a simmering debate in digital advertising over quality assurance, or “brand safety,” standards online. Google has since improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads, chief business officer Philipp Schindler said in a recent interview. Johnson & Johnson, one of the largest advertisers to pull spending, said it is reversing its position in most major markets. Since the boycott began, Google has allocated more of its artificial intelligence tools to deciphering YouTube’s enormous video library. The company is a pioneer in the field and has used machine learning to improve many of its products and services, including video recommendation on YouTube and ad-serving. Automatically classifying entire videos, then flagging and filtering content is a more difficult and expensive research endeavour — one that Google has not focused on much, until now. “We switched to a completely new generation of our latest and greatest machine-learning models. We had not deployed it to this problem, because it was a tiny, tiny problem. We have limited resources,” said Mr Schindler. In talks with big advertising clients, Google discovered the toxic YouTube videos flagged in recent media reports represented about one one-thousandth of a percent of total ads shown, Schindler said. Still, with YouTube’s size, that can add up quickly. And the attention on the issue coincided with mounting industry pressure on Google, the world’s largest digital ad-seller, for more rigid measurement standards. One demand has been for Google to let other companies verify standards on YouTube. Google is allowing this now, creating a “brand safety” reporting channel that lets YouTube ads be monitored by partners such as ComScore and Integral Ad Science, according to a company spokeswoman.

News sign-up 'Tiny' number of ads not safe, says Google News, 04 April 2017 Topics Context & position of advertising Online video planning & buying MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA: As part of its ongoing efforts to reassure advertisers about the placement of ads on YouTube, a Google executive has stressed that very few ads ever run alongside extremist content. "It has always been a small problem," according to Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, who told Recode that there were only ever "very, very, very small numbers" of ads running against videos that weren't safe for brands. "I don't want to take away from the importance of the problem, and that we need to get it right," he said, "but the numbers are tiny, tiny." His comments come amid a developing crisis first sparked by revelations in The Times and fuelled by the decisions of a number of UK public bodies, media owners and brands to pull ads from YouTube over concerns these were appearing alongside "inappropriate" content. But many advertisers never pulled out, a Google representative subsequently informed Recode, adding that "many have decided to come back based on the actions we've taken over the past week". Those actions include upgraded software that can track down five times more videos that the platform wants to keep clear from advertisers and faster response time when someone flags an inappropriate video. Schindler claimed that the issue was not a new one, but rather one that had become public. "We've had that problem, at scale, for a long time," he said. "The problem comes from the fact that somebody is aggressively putting it onto the front page. As well as the unwelcome attention, he argued that "the problem has become a bit more multifaceted" as it becomes less easy to block content on the basis of "clear, specific words, that are very clearly triggering something" – the use of the "N word" being a classic example. "If you would just block [videos] when people refer to the black community with [the ] N word, you would take out a pretty significant percentage of all rap videos," he observed. "You would probably take out a lot of pro-black activist groups. But obviously you want to take it out when somebody says 'we hate all N words'. "The problem is now, the machines have to start understanding context in a much different way," he added. Meanwhile, Google is continuing to "carefully evaluate" the standards for the videos it allows to appear on YouTube.

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

The door have long been blown right open. We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross. Will S. Sweet...They should've thought of this years ago though... JG Google does (or at least did) have a parent share agreement with Samsung and someone else... I wouldn't be opposed to finding or this enhances that and allows OEMs to share features easier. I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel.

Now for those who are fans of Waze, you will be pleased to learn that Google seems to be getting ready to test out the app on Android Auto. Prior to this, Waze’s integration (or plans for integration) was announced back at Google I/O in 2016, but following the announcement nothing came to fruition, at least until now where users who are part of the Waze Beta Community have been getting emails asking if they’d like to participate in the test. The test has yet to officially begin but like we said, emails are being sent out to users to see who might be interested in taking part in it. This will naturally require users to own an Android Auto device and according to the email, it requires that users either own an Android Auto device or who plan to get one. No word on when the testing will begin or how many testers they are seeking, but if you are interested in taking part in it, you can sign up for it here, although there are no guarantees that you will be accepted.

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

The door have long been blown right open. We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross. Will S. Sweet...They should've thought of this years ago though... JG Google does (or at least did) have a parent share agreement with Samsung and someone else... I wouldn't be opposed to finding or this enhances that and allows OEMs to share features easier. I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel.

In the study titled "It's Lit: A guide to what teens think is cool," Google conducted a survey on 400 teens aged 13 to 17, and 800 millennials, or those aged 18-26, last year. Brands were evaluated with figures between 4 and 9, with a higher figure indicating that the companies appealed more to younger consumers and were considered "cool." A similar survey was also conducted to keep track of consumer awareness, which gave figures up to 10 to each brand. Samsung posted a figure between 7 and 7.5, among millennials, similar to U.S. archrival Apple Inc. Its brand awareness also hovered between 8.75 and 10. Other brands that were considered cooler than Samsung and Apple were online shopping mall Amazon.com, sports brand Nike, electric carmaker Tesla, video-sharing web YouTube, streaming service provider Netflix and Google. Samsung was viewed as being cooler than its Japanese rival Sony Corp. and global coffee chain Starbucks among millennials, the report showed. As for teens aged from 13 to 17, Samsung also received a figure between 6.5 and 7, which was similar to Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Nintendo. Apple received a higher grade compared with Samsung among teens with a reading of 7.5.

Anthony Levandowski – now head of Uber’s self-driving program and a key player in Google’s high-profile intellectual property lawsuit against Uber – collected $120m in “incentive payments” from Google, according to the claim, “all while he was breaching his obligations to Google and building a company that would compete with Google”. The filing also alleges that while at Google, he helped the company investigate one of two competing firms with which he was involved. Who is Anthony Levandowski, and why is Google suing him? Read more The filing provides new details about Google’s case against Levandowski, suggesting that his alleged plot to steal trade secrets involved his clandestine association with the side companies dating back to 2012. The claims have come to light a week after Levandowski invoked his fifth amendment right, with his lawyers stating in court that there is “potential for criminal action”. Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google’s parent Alphabet, first filed the suit against Uber in February, accusing the ride-share company of engaging in the “calculated theft” of its technology. The complaint claimed that Levandowski downloaded “sensitive, secret, and valuable internal Waymo information” before leaving to start his own self-driving truck company, Otto, which Uber acquired for $680m in 2016. The lawsuit, which could be a fatal setback for Uber’s self-driving car ambitions, stems from Waymo’s proprietary LiDAR system, which are the “eyes” the cars use to observe and respond to the world around the vehicles. Spokespeople for Google and Uber declined to comment, and a lawyer for Levandowski did not respond to a request for comment. Google lawsuit could be a fatal setback for Uber's self-driving dreams Read more The filing claimed that Levandowski was previously involved in two enterprises known as Odin Wave and Tyto Lidar. Odin Wave was incorporated around August 2012 and listed at an address owned by Levandowski, according to the filing. In 2013, Google said it learned that Odin Wave had submitted an order for a part that was similar to one used by Google in its “unique and proprietary laser technology” for self-driving cars. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Anthony Levandowski, head of Uber’s self-driving program, speaks about their driverless car in San Francisco. Photograph: Eric Risberg/AP At the time, Levandowski denied having any ownership interest in Odin Wave, which later merged with a firm called Tyto Lidar. The manager of Tyto, which was developing LiDAR sensor modules, was “friends with Levandowski and worked with Levandowski on an early, self-driving vehicle prototype”, the filing said. Levandowski was involved in the side companies while he was working on Google’s LiDAR sensor modules, according to the claim. In 2015, Google began to investigate possibly buying or using Tyto’s products or purchasing the company, and Levandowski was a part of that process while at Google. Levandowski visited Tyto’s headquarters as part of the investigation and was aware of “Google’s confidential opinion of Tyto’s technology and the viability of Tyto’s business”, according to the claim. Levandowski did not disclose his “relationship with Tyto and its employees”, which, according to the claim “conflicted with Levandowski’s duties to Google”. In May 2016, Tyto merged with Otto, shortly before Uber bought Otto. Is Lyft really the 'woke' alternative to Uber? Read more The filing released on Monday was authored by Google’s attorneys in October 2016, outlining the case against Levandowski. The document, however, has only come to light now because Uber filed it as evidence to support its push to have the case resolved in private arbitration, as opposed to a public trial. The document is an earlier arbitration demand from Google against Levandowski. In what appears to be a redaction error by Uber’s attorneys, the documents revealed that Otto co-founder Lior Ron was also targeted in the earlier arbitration demand from Google. Uber has previously kept his name secret and appeared to redact it throughout the filing except on one page. The lawsuit and theft claims are one of many scandals plaguing Uber. CEO Travis Kalanick has faced widespread criticisms for a company culture that enables sexual harassment and discrimination, and the co-founder was also recently caught on video berating a driver. The company has also faced numerous high-profile departures and backlash for a secretive tool it used to evade law enforcement.

While it sure beats having your phone blare out notifications and ringtones at inopportune moments, it can be a real pain in the arse when you misplace it. No you can't 'just call it', it's on silent. Or can you? If you have an Android with an associated Google account, you may actually have a chance. While I set up Where's My Droid on my first phone for situations like this, I failed to do the same with subsequent phones. Unlike most apps that you install when you need them, apps like Where's My Droid require you to install them before you need them. Luckily, Google has an answer for those who aren't so forward-thinking. It's called Android Device Manager, a small toolset that connects with all devices associated with your Google account. Presuming your device is able to connect to the internet, Device Manager can find your missing phone and from there gives you a few options for recovering it. First, Google gives you an approximate location (mine was accurate to within 7 metres at one point), and from there you have the option to either remotely lock the phone, permanently erase its contents or ring the phone at full volume for five minutes — even if the phone is on silent or vibrate. Device Manager is also available as an app, if you have a spare device to use it on. The app also allows you to help a friend by logging them in in 'guest mode'. The best thing about Device Manager is that it's opt-out — meaning it's probably enabled for you even if it never crossed your mind to set it up. If you do want to change the settings, you can opt out of the option to lock and erase, or you can disallow Google tracking your device's location (or both). This setting is found under 'Security' in Google Settings on your Android. Image: Lifehacker But while it may be a privacy concern to let Google know where you are, it's arguably better for your privacy to have the ability to remotely lock or erase your device. Still, if you need Device Manager, you now know where to find it. WATCH MORE: Tech News & Life Hacks Comments cameronj @cameronj Apr 4, 2017, 12:20pm Is this just the same as googling find my phone?

Dan Goodin - Apr 3, 2017 11:47 pm UTC Employees of MGM reader comments 8 Share this story Researchers have uncovered one of the most advanced espionage apps ever written for the Android mobile operating system. They found the app after it had infected a few dozen handsets. Further ReadingActively exploited iOS flaws that hijack iPhones patched by ApplePegasus for Android is the companion app to Pegasus for iOS, a full-featured espionage platform that was discovered in August infecting the iPhone of a political dissident located in the United Arab Emirates. Researchers from Google and the mobile-security firm Lookout found the Android version in the months following, as they scoured the Internet. Google said an Android security feature known as Verify Apps indicated the newly discovered version of Pegasus had been installed on fewer than three-dozen devices. "Pegasus for Android is an example of the common feature-set that we see from nation states and nation state-like groups," Lookout researchers wrote in a technical analysis published Monday. "These groups produce advanced persistent threats (APT) for mobile with the specific goal of tracking a target not only in the physical world, but also the virtual world." Like its iOS counterpart, Pegasus for Android offers a wide array of spying functions, including: Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio and video capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Viber, and Kakao Browser history exfiltration E-mail exfiltration from Android’s Native E-mail client Contacts and text message exfiltration This app will self-destruct Pegasus for Android also has the ability to self-destruct when it's at risk of being discovered or compromised. The self-destruct mechanism can be triggered in several different ways: if the mobile country code associated with the SIM card is invalid; if an "antidote" file exists in the /sdcard/MemosForNotes folder; if the app has been unable to connect to an attacker-controlled server for 60 days; or if the app receives a command from the server to remove itself. "It's clear that this malware was built to be stealthy, targeted, and is very sophisticated," Lookout researchers wrote in a blog post. The iOS version of Pegasus took hold of targeted devices by exploiting a trio of critical security vulnerabilities that were unknown to Apple and most other security researchers. All that was required for an iPhone to be infected was that it open a booby-trapped website. (Apple patched the vulnerabilities at the same time that researchers from Citizen Lab and Lookout announced their discovery.) In the event the attempted iOS jailbreak was unsuccessful, Pegasus would abort all attempts to infect the iPhone. Pegasus for Android, by contrast, doesn't rely on zero-day security bugs to root targeted devices so they can be infected. Instead, it uses a well-known rooting technique called Framaroot in an attempt to override security safeguards built into the Android OS. And in the event the rooting doesn't work, the espionage app seeks permissions required to exfiltrate data. As a result, Pegasus for Android is easier to deploy and has additional opportunities to take hold if the first attempt fails. The app was never located in Google Play, Google said in its own blog post published Monday. Verify Apps showed Israel as the country hosting the largest number of targeted phones followed by Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Both the Lookout and Google blog posts attributed Pegasus for Android to NSO Group, an Israel-based seller of computer exploits that was also credited with creating Pegasus for iOS. So-called lawful intercept software is ostensibly sold to legitimate law enforcement agencies so they can investigate and prosecute crimes. In practice, the tools are routinely used against citizens of Russia, Iran, and many other countries with repressive governments. Given how narrowly targeted the Pegasus attacks were, the chances are extremely small that they infected readers of this post. The previously mentioned technical analysis will allow more technically knowledgeable people to know if a given phone has been compromised. Lookout is asking anyone with evidence they came into contact with Pegasus for Android or iOS to contact researchers at threatintel@lookout.com. Promoted Comments Tiernoc Ars Praetorian jump to post Quote: Both the Lookout and Google blog posts attributed Pegasus for Android to NSO Group, an Israel-based seller of computer exploits that was also credited with creating Pegasus for iOS. This answered my biggest question. With the fairly impressive list of features and tools available to it, it read very suspiciously like something composed by a nation-state, especially with the self-destruct capability built in. You don't typically find a "this malware will self-destruct" button on bad apps, it's usually more of the "You F^%&ed up, now pay us" kind. 861 posts | registered 12/11/2014 Dan Goodin Dan is the Security Editor at Ars Technica, which he joined in 2012 after working for The Register, the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, and other publications.

So far, its members comprise a group of nine: LG, Samsung, Foxconn, HMD Global, HTC, Coolpad, BQ, Allview and Google itself. Together, the members own more than 230,000 patents worldwide. Absent from the list of current Pax members include companies such as Acer, Asus, Huawei, Lenovo (Motorola), Sony and ZTE. “In the world of intellectual property, patent peace often coincides with innovation and healthy competition that benefit consumers,” states the company in a blog post, adding later: “This community-driven clearinghouse [of patent licenses], developed together with our Android partners, ensures that innovation and consumer choice—not patent threats—will continue to be key drivers of our Android ecosystem.” Pax is free to join and open to anyone, Google notes, and it encourages companies around the world — large and small — to join in the cause. The Android ecosystem, it notes, has grown to include more than 400 partner manufacturers and 500 carriers who have produced more than 4,000 major devices in the last year with 1.6 billion active users. Previous to Pax, Google’s other efforts in the realm of patent peace include the LOT Network and the Open Patent Non-assertion Pledge, and it is also a participating member in initiatives such as the Open Invention Network and IP3 run by Allied Security Trust.

Margaret Rhodes Design Date of Publication: 04.03.17. 04.03.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 pm. 7:00 pm Google’s New Font Honors Ancient Type Traditions Adobe Google Fonts, the company’s archive of free, open source fonts, lists more than 800 typographic designs. But Source Han Serif, which the company unveiled today, is unique in its utility. It looks consistent across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages, as well as English, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts. Crafting it was no small feat: Google partnered with Adobe and worked with five international type foundries to design thousands of letterforms that are authentic to each culture, yet still manage to look unmistakably related. Source Han Serif is a gift to anyone who builds products in multiple languages. “When you take two fonts and mix them together, you’ll see that the characters don’t look right together,” says Bob Jung, Google’s director of internationalization efforts. He calls it the ransom note effect. It’s a major hurdle for designers who work with Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) scripts. Those languages contain tens of thousands of characters versus the mere dozens you find in Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Developing a universal CJK font that evokes the same look and feel as, say, Times New Roman, is very hard to do. Adobe But that’s exactly what Jung’s team has done with Source Han Serif. It’s a simple serif font with the literary vibe and easy legibility of a typeface like Baskerville or Sentinel. Google and Adobe released it as a companion to Source Han Sans, a sans serif font that also maintains its style across CJK scripts. (Serif fonts, which have small, ever-so-slightly ornamental strokes on their characters, are generally more intricate than sans-serif ones, and are therefore more difficult to design.) Last fall Google also rolled out Noto, a font that works across 800 languages, excluding CJK ones. To appreciate why Source Han Serif is so impressive, it helps to understand the complexities of CJK scripts. Consider, for example, that even symbols the languages share in common can vary in subtle but significant ways. In a Chinese character, two ligaments will meet at one, tidy point; in Japanese or Korean, an adjoining line in a character might reach past the other. These nuances stem from pre-digital lettering techniques. Chinese letters were painted with continuous brushstrokes, whereas Japanese and Korean letters came from block printing. Google “If you don’t preserve these conventions in the characters, say if you used this Simplified Chinese version of the glyph and presented it to a Japanese speaker, it gives the document a non-Japanese feeling,” says Ken Lunde, a linguist and computer scientist at Adobe. “If you follow the regional conventions, it tells a user that you’ve designed a product for them, and not just repurposed for their language.” Lunde, the author of two books on the letterforms of East Asian languages, was in charge of mapping which characters in CJK scripts were shared and which required a unique deign. The more shared glyphs, the better for the font’s file size; and the smaller the file size, the faster Source Han Sans and Serif can load for its users. In the end, he and the type designers only had to draw 270 individual characters for each of the four scripts. Around 7,000 character files work for all four scripts. Google and Adobe are making Source Han Serif free and open source. Its widespread use will cut down on that pesky ransom note effect, allowing products to maintain a consistent design across languages and interfaces. That should come as a relief to designers, developers, and any company operating on a global scale. When expanding internationally, the last thing you want to worry about is a messy-looking typeface.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 53 Plus 1 on G+ 137 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares273 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like the Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

Kappa saf1927 What is VR again? Ah, some shit that everyone likes to experience once and then realises it's shit. Morten Ulv I must have missed the part where it's shit. Kevin It was actually cool. It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD Adrian Meredith Hmm what? Vr is incredible can't go back to playing elite on a 2d screen Jesse Lee You must be using Daydream VR and not Oculus because you would have realized you're comment is complete shit. George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.) MicroNix And you think that would be fair when it was Samsung that was to market much earlier with VR than Google? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Sorry to break it to you. But cardboard was out in June of 2014. Gear vr didn't get released until like november of 2015. Over a year later. And at that time, it was basically just a plastic google cardboard. Willie Chalmers III Well, Cardboard was introduced at I/O in May 2014, and Gear VR was released in November 2015. Daydream was released in November 2016. Does that make it any more fair? It doesn't matter if it's fair, I'm just explaining Google's options. I'm not happy about the prospects, but I noted that Google could make Daydream a requirement for GMS at the risk of an antitrust lawsuit.

Willie Chalmers III Yeah, I noted that. That's the unfortunate reality of corporate politics. JohnyNoLegs Maybe since Samsung comes up with everything great in Android, Google should be the one using Samsung rather than the other way. Samsung Gear VR is and has been far better for ages. Kawshik Ahmed Google can't implement Gear VR to Android because it's not Open Source rather it is own by Oculus/Facebook. If a OEM share their technology with AOSP, Google have no problem to implement it, take for example Sony, who shared 50+ enhancement in Android O alone. X-47B or think Google - who don't add even the latest google search to AOSP. Is latest chrome, google assistant part of AOSP? Samsung shared KNOX with google, which they are not supposed to. Kawshik Ahmed Chrome has it's own Open Source form named Chromium so it doesn't need to be with AOSP. Anyone can use it like Opera and many others are doing. Google Search and Assistant are not features or enhancement nor part of the actual OS, they are services and it takes money to maintain the servers to run them. I don't think any company will make their services open sourced. It's like saying Samsung should open source Bixby which will never happen. blueman24 That would be good only if samsung made any polished software plus made it open source. JohnyNoLegs Google can't even do that so not sure what you are inferring. illregal Said no one ever. Samsung is a disease. Holding back true innovation with their lackluster devices. Diogo Neves Yeah, the competition really looks fierce for Samsung lol illregal buying reviews, paying to badmouth your competition, marketing dollars and dumbasses eating it up doesn't mean the device is any good. It means you've been had. JohnyNoLegs Sounds like Apple to me haha. Pixel isn't far behind... Good_Ole_Pinocchio No need to support Daydream. There's zero benefit to Samsung. MJ Yes, customer needs are of no concern to Samsung also like updates. billy routh Samsung has their own VR and it's Miles ahead of Google's crappy daydream. Chris Sanner that's...nice? but it means lock-in - if I'm on a nexus/pixel and I leave for a samsung phone...I lose what content I had. if I decide that's fine and move to samsung, if I want to leave and go back to a pixel I lose the content. that means I have to be willing to bet that I will *always* buy Samsung. and guess what - I'm not. Anthony820 And when I switch to Canon I lose all my Nikon lenses. And when I switch back I lose all my canon. And went I switched from iPhone I lost all my apps and had to re-purchase them for a new OS. I say everyone fully endorses their competition's ecosystem of services/products. Chris Sanner um...except this is like someone making a canon-based camera and refusing to support the new cannon attachments on the next release. that's kinda shitty and would be enough to keep me from buying the cannon-based camera OligarchyAmbulance "Miles ahead" lol ok Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of all customer needs, DayDream support is absolute last on that list. No need for it. They want VR? They'll get a freeheadset JohnyNoLegs Lol samsung VR??? And who needs breaking updates. MJ I am not sure why Samsung VR is so funny and... No updates for you huh? Are you one of those people still using Windows XP on their PC? JohnyNoLegs Samsung be is available for customers of Samsung, and it's far better than Daydream still. And no I'm on pixel xl running 7.1.2, but really it's the same as 7.0 so no benefit of having pixel for the past 5 months. AsterMK Daydream is far from a need. It's a want, and barely anyone wants VR in general. Of those that do want it, almost everyone prefers Gear VR. Ra1nb0wD4sh DE I would totally get a HTC Vive, but it's too expensive atm. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They want you to use GearVR MJ Yes, which is the opposite of giving customer choice aka what they may want. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Corporations don't care what you want Rob Cook Your argument is invalid, Samsung isn't forced to provide Daydream as they have developed, in their opinion a superior alternative. The customer choice here is to not buy Samsung if you feel that Daydream is the better product (arguably it's not). You logic is saying that Samsung MUST provide Daydream as well or there isn't a choice being offered at all. That's like saying that Cheverolet MUST offer a V12 quad-turbo in the Corvett because Bugatti offers one in the Chiron. Yes both are cars but that's it. MJ Ummmm The argument I never made is invalid? OK... Dude, I never said Samsung should be REQUIRED to provide Daydream support. I did infer Samsung should should give their customers options. LOL I do agree about NOT buying Samsung products. It is amazing to me all comments defending Samsung on this. Who doesn't like options and prefers a walled garden? Oh yeah... Your analogy was really stupid by the way. What I am saying is the what Ford does with their touch screen system in supporting Apples' CarPlay and Android Auto is better way to go than just supporting one or the other or using a proprietary only system. Jesse Lee Well then why didn't Google offer Oculus support on its Pixel phones....no customer support needs I guess. This was a no-brainer, I thought anyway but.... Dave I will not buy a S8 without Daydream. I was going to finally buy my first new phone since the Note 2, but now think I will wait for the Pixel 2. Mike549 They're losing my purchase of an s8 because of it. I already have the s7 with gear VR but I want access to Daydream too. YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They chose not to support it because they are not idiots. Why would they risk losing VR market share? MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. illregal Samsung copied google here.. There's no debate, gear vr came out way after cardboard. samsung pay, etc.. All out after google. Samsung hasn't had an original thought in years, unless it has to do with ripping off their idiot customers. JohnyNoLegs I didn't know Cardboard had sensors in it..... I thought it was just a piece of cardboard with a lense... dhamp2g Cardboard was 1st dude!!! JohnyNoLegs Then VR with actual sensors and lag free use came out... DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. illregal oculus is proprietary crap and losing badly to vive. Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Ryan IMHO Gear and daydream provide the very same experience in term of quality. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Mike549 Verizon stores have Daydream devices for demo purposes. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. Klark Kenneth Wait, are you saying it's a fail or are you saying "No? FAIL."? MJ "Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL." What the hell is that supposed to mean? Jesse Lee Dude, stop trolling. Nexus phones were made by Google, the N6 was less then 2 years old when Daydream VR came out and Google didn't even support it. Yet, you're comments seem to contradict that reality and keep bashing Sammy when Google's support is much much worse when it comes to VR. You're barking up the wrong tree is how the expression goes and its apparent from reading this section. MJ Speak about trolling... The OP statement I quoted made so sense so I asked him to explain it. What does that have to do with you buddy? Daydream is NOT supported on the Nexus 6? So what? You need minimal hardware support for a good experience so it's better than something like Cardboard. FACT: Samsung’s first consumer Gear VR headset didn't support any previous Samsung phones either. FACT: Goggle Daydream is open to other OEMs while Samsung's VR solution is NOT. Now go away... Mike549 Agreed. I think the same applies to the Rift and Vive for exclusive too. Ryan The most targeted platform is Cardboard... ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Sudev Together but not the same :) Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. Ryan I disagree it's a bit like the console/PC war non sense. While I understand people might want to only experience it on PC for obvious reasons there are a lot of smaller players that are enjoying mobile VR a lot. While it's true there is a lot of crap in the store there are some really good games. Jon Fridman VR on phones doesn't look anywhere near as good based on experience. Consoles are irrelevant to this as well because they still don't have the raw power a PC can (yes thst includes the PS VR headset). While the graphics may look decent, they can't compare to higher end systems. Once VR has matured I think it'll be fine to use on phones. In the current state I cannot see a reason to use a VR headset. I won't buy one for my PC either despite having a more than capable set up (i7 6800K/EVGA 1080FTW/32GB RAM). When the next generation comes out I'll likely buy one. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol op12 Daydream expanded beyond the Pixel a while ago... https://vr.google.com/daydream/phones/#daydream-ready-phones Jesse Lee Yeah, it works great on any phone now named Pixel Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Atoqir Well that is saying like "Why do my PS4 exclusives don't work on Xbox" There is always some artificial lockout to make a platform more attractive. And I don't think it's a bad thing. It makes competitors do better and create the best platform for the biggest chunk of users. And the least popular loses and doesn't have a vibrant ecosystem. Look at Windows Mobile as prime example. Cause we are not talking about regular hardware products anymore. These days every products is a weapon the "wars of the ecosystems/platforms" Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Ryan VR is not pleasing for everyone.But there are a lot of people that love it. kalehv Oh I love it too. but there's not much to do yet. Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR. Ryan And this is why, as a VR Dev , I only target cardboard for now. Hope the VR future will be brighter and easier for everyone! It is a really good medium. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So you'd rather target a limited audience rather than a large one? How is this a good business decision? darkvadur 1 April??..... Sudev Together but not the same :) Mike549 I was going to get the S8 if it supported both platforms but not now. I'll just keep my S7 and get a Daydream compatible phone if an interesting one comes out soon. Sean Thomas to be fair...daydream is bad. I haven't used Gear VR, but Daydream isn't worth it right now if they already have a platform with more support. Daydream shouldn't be on par with oculus if it's bad tbh. Google should just work with oculus to make an android-wide deal. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Serious question: Does the Pixel / Pixel XL support Gear VR? Jordan L probably not, I'm guessing Gear VR is a Samsung exclusive thing. Whereas Daydream is available to all. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Isn't Gear VR the same VR as Oculus? If so, it's not Samsung exclusive. Jordan L I don't know. I thought it was called Samsung Gear VR. Oculus has a VR framework that is available to cell phone makers? If that's true, then Daydream should work work that, I agree. A big part of Daydream was the ability for other companies to join in. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I googled it. Yes, Samsung Gear VR is powered by Oculus. So it's probably going to have the most content, which is what will make it the most successful VR. If it turns out Daydream gets the most content, then I'm sure Samsung will support it. Otherwise they'll lose customers. This is no different than prior format wars like Betamax vs. VHS or HD DVD vs. Blu-ray. Whoever gets the most content wins. Jordan L Fragmentation. Google allows all companies to attempt to do Daydream... so Samsung does their own thing. Chris Sanner Dear Samsung: this sort of shit is why I refuse to buy any more of your phones. like, ever. dhamp2g WTF this type of shit kills me. Why wouldn't google make it required to use android?????. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Why does it bother you? If Daydream wins the VR competition, then Samsung will either lose customers or be forced to support Daydream. If Gear VR wins, then Google and Daydream phones will either lose customers or be forced to support it. That's the way the free market works. dhamp2g bc I bought a daydream when it was on sale bc I though 4sure that the s8 would support it. I will get the next pixel when it comes out and ditch my s8 and use my s7 for gearVR. I wanted one phone for both. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck with that! I don't care about VR, but if I did, I'd get the phone that supports VR with the most content. That's what determines the end game. Suicide_Note VR is crap, and anything that speeds its demise is fine by me. https://media0.giphy.com/media/d4aTnvQuF6xyfgWI/giphy.gif kgptzac Anyone with a brain should not find this surprising, and should be easily see the reasons behind it. Once again the burden falls to developers to either make exclusives, or games that support multiple VR platforms. It's not unfair either... developers have always been choosing between sony and microsoft on consoles, and google and apple on mobile, so it's fair game. likurges daydream is a gimmick. useless crap in it's current form. On the other hand samsung is an ass for not supporting it Averix No great loss. VR is a fad for right now. The lack of content makes that obvious. Since they're giving away a headset for the Samsung Oculus experience, I don't think Daydream matters much here. Jesse Lee "Could" be Samsung's deal with Oculus?! Absolutely it has to do with the competing VR platform offered by Oculus. I guess I never would have thought they were going to and never got hopes up for it just the same as I never thought the Pixel was going to include Oculus software, kind of a no-brainer really. Jordan L It's possible the Samsung could support both VR's, and maybe Oculus is elusive to Samsung? So pixel couldn't support both platforms. If that's true, then one could hope Samsung would support both.(it was a long shot). Daydream is open to all manufactures... Is Oculus?

Business Cybersecurity Detection Disasters Government Infrastructure Public Safety Public health Regional Sci-Tech Surveillance Terrorism Transportation Water CybersecurityGoogle’s AI tool for video searching can be easily deceived Published 3 April 2017 Share | Researchers have shown that Google’s new tool that uses machine learning to automatically analyze and label video content can be deceived by inserting a photograph periodically and at a very low rate into videos. After they inserted an image of a car into a video about animals, for instance, the system returned results suggesting the video was about an Audi. University of Washington researchers have shown that Google’s new tool that uses machine learning to automatically analyze and label video content can be deceived by inserting a photograph periodically and at a very low rate into videos. After they inserted an image of a car into a video about animals, for instance, the system returned results suggesting the video was about an Audi. Google recently released its Cloud Video Intelligence API to help developers build applications that can automatically recognize objects and search for content within videos. Automated video annotation would be a breakthrough technology, helping law enforcement efficiently search surveillance videos, sports fans instantly find the moment a goal was scored or video hosting sites weed out inappropriate content. Google launched a demonstration website that allows anyone to select a video for annotation. The API quickly identifies the key objects within the video, detects scene changes and provides shot labels of the video events over time. The API website says the system can be used to “separate signal from noise, by retrieving relevant information at the video, shot or per frame” level. UW says that in a new research paper, the UW electrical engineers and security researchers, including doctoral students Hossein Hosseini and Baicen Xiao and professor Radha Poovendran, demonstrated that the API can be deceived by slightly manipulating the videos. They showed one can subtly modify the video by inserting an image into it, so that the system returns only the labels related to the inserted image. The same research team recently showed that Google’s machine-learning-based platform designed to identify and weed out comments from internet trolls can be easily deceived by typos, misspelling offensive words or adding unnecessary punctuation. “Machine learning systems are generally designed to yield the best performance in benign settings. But in real-world applications, these systems are susceptible to intelligent subversion or attacks,” said senior author Radha Poovendran, chair of the UW electrical engineering department and director of the Network Security Lab. “Designing systems that are robust and resilient to adversaries is critical as we move forward in adopting the AI products in everyday applications.” As an example, the researchers took a sample video named “animals.mp4,” which shows a tiger in a cage, and which is provided by the API website. Google’s tool does indeed accurately identify the video labels. The researchers then inserted an image of an Audi car into the video once every two seconds. The modification is hardly visible, since the image is added once every fifty video frames, for a frame rate of twenty-five. The API’s output for the manipulated video showed the tiger in its cage – but the Google tool believed with high confidence that the manipulated video is all about the car, and annotated the video accordingly. “Such vulnerability of the video annotation system seriously undermines its usability in real-world applications,” said lead author and UW electrical engineering doctoral student Hossein Hosseini. “It’s important to design the system such that it works equally well in adversarial scenarios.” “Our Network Security Lab research typically works on the foundations and science of cybersecurity,” said Poovendran, the lead principal investigator of a recently awarded MURI grant, where adversarial machine learning is a significant component. “But our focus also includes developing robust and resilient systems for machine learning and reasoning systems that need to operate in adversarial environments for a wide range of applications.” — Read more in Hossein Hosseini et al., “Deceiving Google’s Cloud Video Intelligence API Built for Summarizing Videos” (Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, March 2017) Share | More Stories: Business Hackers Leave a comment Register for your own account so you may participate in comment discussion.

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross. Will S. Sweet...They should've thought of this years ago though... JG Google does (or at least did) have a parent share agreement with Samsung and someone else... I wouldn't be opposed to finding or this enhances that and allows OEMs to share features easier. I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel.

Basically, this new licensing program will allow members — which include some of Google’s many Android partners — to stop threatening each other over software patents. Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services Google says that some of the biggest names in Android-related products have already signed on, including LG, Samsung, HTC, and of course, Google itself. Between them there are almost a quarter million software patents to go around: PAX members currently include Google, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Foxconn Technology Group, HMD Global, HTC, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview. The members collectively own more than 230,000 patents worldwide. As more companies join, PAX will bring even more patent peace and value to its members through more freedom to innovate. Google is billing this an an effort to “expand the openness” of the Android ecosystem, building on the principles that the mobile operating system was built on. This new level of “patent peace” will “free up time and money for members,” Google says, which should let them focus on other, more important things. Details are a bit scarce at the moment, but Google says that joining is open and free to anyone. You can send a license request over at the PAX website.

Every couple of weeks (or at least it feels that way) we hear about a new server-side test where the company is trying out something new. Right now, there are a couple of tests showing up in the app — previews while seeking through a video, and a bottom bar interface. The best gifts for Android users First, let’s talk about preview seeking. This is a feature we’ve seen on YouTube web interface for a long time, and the idea is pretty simple. As a user drags along the progress bar, they can see a quick frame showing what is happening in the video at that point before going to it. It’s a useful feature for sure, and it should prove very valuable. So far we’re not seeing this internally, but some users on Reddit are reporting it on their devices. It’s also worth noting with this change that it’s not the first time we’ve seen Google implement this. The Google Play Movies app on Android has done this for quite some time, and YouTube for iOS does as well, so, at the very least, it will be nice to see this land on Android. Along with that, the bottom bar interface has popped up yet again on the YouTube app this time to a few Android Police readers. This change is also pretty simple. Rather than having the tab interface it currently has, this test moves everything to the bottom of the app just like on the iOS YouTube app. Personally I’ve not been a fan of bottom bar interfaces on Android (even though my colleague Stephen loves it), but in this case, I don’t hate it, except on a tablet, where it looks horrid. As usual with these changes, it’s unclear if they’ll ever actually hit the app for everyone, but as they mature, they very well could. What do you think about these changes?

This all happens only a couple of weeks after Google began pushing the final 7.1.2 Beta build for similar devices. Full factory images of these latest builds are available for: Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, and Nexus Player. Neither the Nexus 6 nor the Nexus 9 have been updated to 7.2.1 as their product cycles indicate they will only be updated with security patches from here on out. If youve already downloaded and installed the OTA on your Google Pixel or Nexus device, there is no further action required on your part. A devices factory image can be used to reset a modified device or can be used to manually flash an update that is otherwise not arriving via OTA update (this method should only be attempted by those of you who know how to use fastboot.)

Anthony Levandowski, a former Google employee who went on to found the now Uber-owned driverless truck company Otto, collected $120 million from Google, according to CNBC. A lawsuit claims Levandowski was trying to staff up his autonomous trucking start-up while he still worked at Google, but waited until he got his payout to make details public. ADVERTISEMENT Levandowski is being accused in court of stealing Google’s autonomous vehicle sensor technology. Waymo, Google’s driverless car program, has filed a lawsuit claiming that Otto's technology was built using thousands of documents and trade secrets stolen by Levandowski shortly before he left Google. Uber calls the allegations “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” The ride-hailing firm has been aggressively pushing to bring self-driving cars to the masses. Uber began testing driverless cars in some of its fleets last year and quickly snapped up Otto not long after it was founded. Legal filings also allege that while Levandowski was at Google, he was involved with two competing side businesses — Odin Wave and Tyto Lidar — and tried to poach employees from Google, according to CNBC. "Throughout this process, Levandowski never disclosed a relationship with Tyto and its employees," the lawsuit said. "Google now believes that Levandowski in fact had a relationship with Tyto and its employees that conflicted with Levandowski's duties to Google."   View the discussion thread.

That feature would give advertisers a full list of specific videos against which their ads appeared, and how many times their ads were displayed on each, perhaps making marketers more comfortable with advertising on the service.

Google is moving to a new issue tracker Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 9:17am PDTApr 2, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares62 Google News When it comes to Android issue tracking, Google has always used Google Code. However, Google started phasing out Code for most users in 2013, and Google's projects are the only active repositories left. Now the company has started to shift to a new issue tracker, hosted at issuetracker.google.com. The feedback page for Android O states that the new issue tracker has been used internally at Google for a while now, but now the site is publicly-accessible to help collect feedback and bug reports from Android O Dev Preview users. The tracker appears to be split into categories called 'components,' with Android O being one. In addition to Android O, there are components for many other Google services, from the Chromecast SDK to Google's public DNS server.

Android Developer Yet sadly is much less than it. Can't edit. Can't delete (I could do this on previous website, if the post is not the first one of the thread). Can't put images inline (only attach). Can't format text in any way (just plain text is allowed), or at least I don't see it (previous website allowed a bit, using special characters added). In fact, the only features for the post itself, is attachment, either directly or via Google Drive. And even in this, I can't view my own attachments, let alone of others. In previous website, I could, and I could even delete my attachments. Tomáš Petrík Lol, I saw the screenshot in the article and I thought it was Gmail, until I read your comment.

Phone will stop answering calls and just viewing pdfs or photos can lockup the phone requiring hard restart Should have stayed on beta. No features worth the bugs right now Justin W To be fair, they did say it wasn't close to being done.... Bob You really need to wait for the 2nd or 3rd DP to consider their releases as a daily driver. boop It's a developer preview. They required unlocking and flashing the image rather than pushing through the Beta program so people wouldn't put it on their daily drivers. SIGTRAP Are you surprised? It's a developer preview that won't be finally released until October or so. Yeah it's probably going to be buggy as fuck. Rod Oh, so you think this alpha software is buggy? JD Old bug tracker has too many bugs. Solution create new bug tracker.... this time with stickers and messaging platform. -The Google way. Corbin Davenport A bug tracker with stickers would be hilarious. JD Its coming I'm sure.

Alexander Brown If it's 'new' why is it using the old GMail/Drive widget set not Polymer/MDL (as Play Music, Inbox ext do) MrCalifornia It's probably "new" as an external website. I'm guessing they have been using this tool internally, and they just exposed it since the android project needs it's tracker in the public. eclectice I see spammers PVL_93_RU Why did they make it look exactly like Gmail? I mean on one hand I guess it's cool because you're using a familiar interface with a different product, but on the other hand... wouldn't that cause confusion?

"Wi-Fi at home helps with special everyday moments," Google announced on Monday. "But as we all know, sometimes these moments can turn into hours spent watching videos or browsing photos. That’s why we built Scheduled Pause, a new feature in Google Wifi". Scheduled Pause basically lets you pause the internet in your house, as long as you're using Google Wifi as your router. With the new feature, you can automatically disrupt the Wi-Fi for everyday events like bedtime or homework so that your kids can better focus, Google contends. But, in reality, we think you'll just end up upsetting your children who are itching to get online. Still, Google thinks this feature is a great tool for families. The company noticed that people have trouble falling asleep at night because they check emails and surf the web late into the night. And many people, in and outside of Google, have told the company that they find screen time is a particularly common challenge for parents -- "from getting kids to put down their favourite game to struggling to have dinner without eyes glued to devices." Google Now, using the Google Wifi app, parents can tell their Google Wifi to shut down at a specific time in their daily schedule. When the time arrives, their router will pause the internet for specific devices, allowing parents and their devices to still get online while their kids stomp away and pout in the other room. Check out Pocket-lint's Google Wifi guide to see what else the mesh router can do.

By JackMarshall JackNicas Google on Monday unveiled measures meant to help marketers track where advertisements appear across YouTube, in the wake of controversy over the company’s placement of ads alongside videos with objectionable content. The tech giant, a unit of Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.08% GOOGL, +1.06%  , told marketers and advertisers that it plans to allow third-party measurement companies to monitor where ads appear on YouTube, and to report back to marketers on the “brand safety” of its videos. Read: Google’s YouTube ad controversy should scare investors Google already offers similar functionality allowing marketers to track whether their ads were “viewable” or not — meaning whether they actually appeared on users’ screens. According to executives at ad agencies, Google also has promised to offer video-level reporting across YouTube by the third quarter of this year. That feature would give advertisers a full list of specific videos against which their ads appeared, and how many times their ads were displayed on each, perhaps making marketers more comfortable with advertising on the service. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren/Files By Bloomberg News Apr 3, 2017 at 4:50 pm | Print View Two weeks after companies began yanking ads from YouTube because they were popping up next to hateful videos, Google is trying yet again to halt the crisis. Alphabet Inc.’s main division is introducing a new system that lets outside businesses verify ad quality standards on its video service, while expanding its definitions of offensive content. A slew of major marketers halted spending on YouTube and Google’s digital ad network after ads were highlighted running alongside videos promoting hate, violence and racism. Google’s initial response, a promise of new controls for marketers, failed to stymie the boycott. The crisis ignited a simmering debate in digital advertising over quality assurance, or “brand safety,” standards online. Google since as improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler told Bloomberg News in a recent interview. Johnson & Johnson, one of largest advertisers to pull spending, said it is reversing its position in most major markets. Since the boycott began, Google has allocated more of its artificial intelligence tools to deciphering YouTube’s enormous video library. The company is a pioneer in the field and has used machine learning, a powerful type of AI, to improve many of its products and services, including video recommendation on YouTube and ad-serving. Automatically classifying entire videos, then flagging and filtering content is a more difficult, expensive research endeavor — one that Google hasn’t focused on much, until now. “We switched to a completely new generation of our latest and greatest machine-learning models,” Schindler said. “We had not deployed it to this problem because it was a tiny, tiny problem. We have limited resources.” In talks with big advertising clients, Google discovered the toxic YouTube videos flagged in recent media reports represented about one one-1,000th of a percent of total ads shown, Schindler said. Still, with YouTube’s size, that can add up quickly. And the attention on the issue coincided with mounting industry pressure on Google, the world’s largest digital ad-seller, for more rigid measurement standards. A frequent demand has been for Google to let other companies verify standards on YouTube. Google is allowing this now, creating a “brand safety” reporting channel that lets YouTube ads be monitored by external partners such as comScore Inc. and Integral Ad Science Inc., according to a company spokeswoman. Google has made quick progress on its own, he said. Using the new machine-learning tools, and “a lot more people,” the company in the last two weeks flagged five times as many videos as “non-safe,” or disabled from ads, than before. “But it’s five (times) on the smallest denominator you can imagine,” Schindler said. “Although it has historically it has been a very small, small problem. We can make it an even smaller, smaller, smaller problem.” James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co., said the advertising imbroglio may end up benefiting Google because people’s online engagement “has segmented in two arenas. You can’t just ignore a platform with one billion-plus users indefinitely.” People spend time either on major platforms or niche destinations, Cakmak wrote in a note to investors. “The channels of engagement should become abundantly clear, with dollars allocated accordingly. This is good news for the two sides of the spectrum, but everyone in between is likely to get squeezed, with at least a portion of the dollars, if not half or more, going to platforms like Google,” he noted.

And brands are in the midst of some big decisions: the Upfront ad sales period, when broadcast and cable channels pitch their new shows to advertisers, is already underway. The Newfronts, when digital ad platforms pitch their tools and inventory, starts May 1. Chief marketing officers and ad agencies at the conference are discussing what Google has to do for their brands to feel safe on YouTube. "What we're hearing from members is it's time for a lot of these platforms to grow up, but they're still fairly young platforms" says 4A's president and CEO, Nancy Hill, of Google and Facebook. "And unlike these other platforms that we've had — television, radio, print — that have been around forever, they haven't really grown up into a place where you can measure and understand what's really being delivered." Taco Bell's CMO, Marisa Thalberg, says she considers Google an important partner, but right now she's pulling back her brand's ad dollars until Google makes more changes. "We are on a pause ... because at the end of the day, context matters." Mobile ad company Kargo, which only serves ads to sites featuring premium content, is benefitting from the Google boycott. "Brands are migrating those dollars now that their Google dollars are put on hold," says Kargo CEO Harry Kargman. "We're seeing companies like AT&T move their brand dollars to safer content places, and Kargo is one of those places." Kargman, who founded Kargo 14 years ago, says he sees the ad world at a point of change. "What we're finally seeing is that marketers are waking up, and they're saying — 'just doing audience targeting at mass scale is not enough for us. We need to be guaranteed that we're running in great, brand-safe places, we need to know that our brand messages are actually aligned with the messaging on the page itself.'" CEO of marketing giant IPG, Michael Roth, says brands and agencies are using this boycott to push for more transparency. "The best way to keep organizations accountable, is to do it with your pocketbooks, and I think that part of it frankly worked." Roth says some of IPG's clients are starting to return to Google, as it pulls out all the stops to show brands it's working to solve the problem. Google says the problem is under control, saying in a statement from Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler: "Many advertisers never left and many have decided to come back. While they know that no system can be perfect, they appreciate the actions we've taken and know we are taking this seriously and are committed to getting better and better." Still, the timing of the boycott is powerful; brands are sure to push for more transparency and accountability as they lock in deals for the next year.

News Google Doodle pays tribute to engineer for Chicago's Hancock, Willis Tower Fazlur Khan Chicago Tribune Chicago structural engineer Fazlur Khan in 1973. He was recognized in a Google Doodle. Chicago structural engineer Fazlur Khan in 1973. He was recognized in a Google Doodle. (Chicago Tribune) Blair KaminContact ReporterChicago Tribune The Chicago structural engineer who helped mastermind the city's John Hancock Center and Willis Tower on Monday got one of the ultimate recognitions of the digital age — a likeness of him on Google's home page. The image, known as a Google Doodle, pays tribute to the late Fazlur Khan, the Skidmore, Owings & Merrill engineer who worked with SOM architect Bruce Graham to design the iconic skyscrapers and their revolutionary structural systems. It appeared on the 88th anniversary of Khan's birth. He died in 1982. Google Doodle Google Doodle. (Google.com) Google Doodle. (Google.com) The playful sketch portrays the Hancock and the Bangladeshi-American Khan, with his arms outstretched and his hands turned upward, Houdini-like, as if to say: "Voila!" Khan's "ability to build these larger-than-life skyscrapers was sort of magical and whimsical," said Google illustrator Lydia Nichols, who modeled the image on a computer after sketching it in pencil. A green background features a likeness of the Hancock's X-bracing while the letters that spell out Google's name are made up of other buildings and the Hancock, which forms an unlikely "O." Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., typically honors events, anniversaries and notable people with the doodle, which is seen by millions of digital users every day. The city of Chicago is quietly taking the first steps toward making the 100-story John Hancock Center an official city landmark. Granting the Hancock Center protected status would give city officials a powerful tool to control changes to the skyscraper, whose muscular, X-braced exterior made it an emblem of Chicago and influenced a generation of mega-skyscrapers, including the twin towers of New York’s World Trade Center, which were completed a few years later. Others recognized include Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, and the urbanologist Jane Jacobs. Google employees make nominations for doodle subjects. At the Hancock, which opened in 1969, Khan perfected a major technical advance in structural engineering: a structural steel "tube" of exterior columns, reinforced by the tower's X-braces. Early skyscrapers typically were supported by an internal cage of steel columns and beams. Though the cage allowed office buildings to reach once-unthinkable heights, it required a relatively large number of interior columns and chewed up valuable floor space. In contrast, the Hancock's steel tube created vast expanses of column-free space. It also served the building's functional needs by providing big floors on the bottom for offices and parking, and smaller floors above for apartments (later condominiums). In addition, the design was extraordinarily economical; the tower was built for the cost of a conventionally supported 45-story office building. Willis Tower: A brief history The plan for adding features to the Skydeck is the latest chapter in Willis Tower, the Chicago icon that was once the world's tallest building.

So were the tube structures supporting Chicago's Aon Center and Willis Tower. The Google Doodle thrilled Khan's daughter Yasmin, who lives near Boston, and Chicago structural engineers. "Usually it's the architects who get (the recognition)," said Stephanie Crain, executive director of the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois. "It's a very happy day."

Levandowski is at the nexus of a battle between what is now Alphabet's  (GOOGL) self-driving car company, Waymo, and ride-hailing start-up Uber. Waymo alleges that Levandowski stole thousands of documents and trade secrets for Otto, which went on to be rapidly acquired by Uber. (Uber calls these claims "baseless.") New court documents allege that Levandowski's conflicts of interest may have been much deeper. Not only did Levandowski try to poach Google employees, the lawsuit said, but he may have been involved in competing side businesses called Odin Wave and Tyto Lidar. Levandowski denied having ownership interested in Odin Wave when questioned in mid-2013, the lawsuit said, and also helped Google do due diligence for a potential acquisition of Tyto — a company that Otto later acquired. "Throughout this process, Levandowski never disclosed a relationship with Tyto and its employees," the lawsuit said. "Google now believes that Levandowski in fact had a relationship with Tyto and its employees that conflicted with Levandowski's duties to Google." © Provided by CNBC Levandowski hasn't been the only engineer to get hefty sums from Waymo. In the suit, Google said it has had to provide incentives" to convince numerous other employees not to follow Levandowski to Uber. Uber and Waymo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg has previously reported that high paychecks prompted attrition at Google's car project. Bloomberg also reported that Levandowski had a long history of side projects during his time at Google, many sanctioned by founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. "Anthony is a rogue force of nature," former Google self-driving car executive told Bloomberg. "Each phase of his Google career he had a separate company doing exactly the same work." Levandowski has invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination in the lawsuit, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. Lawyers for Levandowski could no immediately be reached. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

Google Photos adds new backup option for spotty cellular connections Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/22 10:07am PDTMar 22, 2017 23 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 Applications Google News At today's Google for Brazil event in São Paulo, the company introduced several new features for its products - such as audio calling in Duo. Another announcement involves new backup options for Google Photos, designed to make backing up on poor connections less tedious. As you may know, Google Photos has a few options for backing up images and videos to the cloud. You can hold off all backups until you reach a Wi-Fi connection, back up only photos on cellular data and use Wi-Fi for video, or back up everything on any connection. Google is introducing a new option, where low-quality images can be backed up over a cellular connection, and are automatically replaced with higher-resolution copies when you reach a stable Wi-Fi connection. Google says these low-quality backups will still look good on a smartphone-sized screen, and uploads should be fast even on a 2G connection. The feature should be rolling out today on Google Photos for Android and iOS.

Something like "phone got stolen, but better a low-res backup than all photos lost"? ilovetesla yup,thats the use Hurricane Andrew Say you're out an about, perhaps on vacation, and are taking a ton of pictures that you want to backup in real time before you get back to your hotel room and don't want to kill your mobile data allowance. Just to give yourself that extra piece of mind in case your phone gets lost/stolen/damaged before you get to a good WiFi signal. Seems like a good idea to me. McStagger this happened to my sister in-law while in Ibiza. Hurricane Andrew Happened to me in Myrtle Beach...old phone was not waterproof. alvareo Indeed Corbin Davenport Google pointed out in its blog post that you could share photos while you're in a remote area, and the recipients could see the images right away and check back later for the full quality. Impulse_Vigil Sure, why not? Having something is better than nothing. I'm curious what the bandwidth usage will be. TheDave1022 Now only if there was an option to download thumbnails of all photos in the cloud and not on device so when you browse through thousands of photos, you dont need to download the previews for all of them. Similar to how the icloud works. McStagger this is a nice feature for people that lose phones often...like myself. But i want an option that always me to back up select photos at FULL RESOLUTION. sometimes i actually print a photo! Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) isn't the backup size like 16MP though, most phones don't go past that so I don't really understand the reason for the full resolution option with smartphones McStagger I just re-read the specs and yes, only gets resized if above 16MP. My nexus is 12.2 so that works for me. teh Jax Not only is the resolution possibly reduced (over 16MP) but there are other compression techniques that Google does to reduce bandwidth and storage space requirements that have the side-effect of also reducing the quality of your photos. Have you ever saved a JPG in a photo editing application and been prompted for "Quality" and chosen 80%? It's something like that. Every time you take a JPG and make *any* visual edit to it and save it again, you're ultimately reducing the quality of that photo. Uploading at "Full Resolution" prevents these actions that reduce quality. McStagger And i just compared a few files. Google Photos are half the file size of original device files. teh Jax Precisely. Tyler Swindell Even though I don't have to worry about Google Photos compression since I have a Pixel XL, I did research the topic for my family members who have other Androids and iPhones. I found a review of Google Photos compression, and turns out, unless you are printing a poster, it's almost imperceptible between the original and the compressed image. http://www.huffingtonpost.in/arpit-verma/bursting-the-myth-of-comp_b_8902076.html Impulse_Vigil Photos right at 16MP are still recompressed from what I remember, so it's not just those that go over. Whether it matters or you'll notice is another story. ngwoo Before I got a Pixel I'd just manually upload to Google Drive the images I wanted to save in full-res before deleting them from my phone. Rod In those cases, you could upload them to Drive. ilovetesla seriously a great feature Rod Please, someone tell me the Photos app now allows the user to pick "Device folders" as startup screen. Borgman Can anyone help. Trying to get my cousin to download GP and it doesn't seem to be working. He has a ton of pics like 1600 but when backing up (on Wifi only) it seems to be stalling or simply not working. He has no storage left on his 32GB phone so I told him GP will back up for free and be able to delete the pics from his phone and have them saved in the cloud. But uploading doesn't seem to be working. Got to around 1000 and just won't work/update anymore. (I have android so I'm not familiar with iOS in the slightest). I told him to see if his albums (Facebook, Snapchat, Downloads, Instagram, MEssenger, etc) had to backup icon selected, but he doesn't even see albums. Does backing up 1500 photos take hours and hours to upload?! Even so, I think he said 2+ hours nothing new had happened. Naga Sridhar See if the option of backup only while charging is checked? Marcelove This happens sometimes when the archive of some photo is "bugged" (ex: your battery died exactly when the phone was same to the memory one photo you just have taken)... When the phone is on again, GP will see the archive as a normal photo and keep trying to upload it, but it never finishes and end by sticking the upload of other photos... The big problem is that isn't easy to spot the exact file... It can even be viewed through any image visualization... Only way to discover is to upload manually each photo or video and check which one won't complete... Tô do that, go to GP, hold your finger at any photo or video, click at the three dots and select BACKUP NOW. Will be a pain in the assault do that for 1500 files, but give it a try... tremsr Interesting. I was in Florida last week and surviving entirely off wifi (on airplane mode). It seems as though my photos backed up over the free/spotty/sketchy networks, then backed up again over the reliable condo wifi. This is the first time Google Photos has generated duplicates of certain photos. Happy to have the backups in emergency situations, but pain in the arse to go through and remove the duplicates taking up space. From what I can see there is no quick "Remove duplicates" option. The only I see is to remove everything backed up from the device (which didn't help my duplicate situation). Trip Rance On Android airplane mode means Wi-Fi is off as well. everything's off tremsr You can enable airplane mode to disable cellular connectivity, then turn on wifi to connect to any available wifi networks. RainMotorsports Nexus 6P 7.1.1 I can't here. Shows as on and no networks available. tremsr Not sure about 7.1.1, but my 6P on 7.0 and S7 on 6.0.1 both allow me to connect to wifi after turning on airplane mode. One of the flights I took to the US required cellular off, but wifi to be able to watch tv shows via their app. Cory S I'd prefer it to be smarter, and just not even try at all if I am on a totally garbage connection. I have had a battery murdered more than once from photos trying to upload a 100 photos over a 2G connection in the middle of nowhere on a hiking trip. JG Google recently announced a new encoding method to reduce the size of jpegs by 35%... Do we know if Google has implemented this yet? Their camera could write the picture using the new jpg format, which means less local storage used. And/or if Google Photos could convert the file, less data would be used uploading the files while maintaining the same quality, Yuri Vidal Still no options to automatically delete local copy after uploading... Would be SO useful on low-end phones, where storage is always full... raptir While it doesn't do it automatically, it's a single button press on "Free Up Space" to delete all your local copies. WestIndiesKING small annoyance, not being able to customize a collage. I love that google just does it magic and tries to center my pictures in a collage but i would love to be able to make adjustments myself. mxwp I don't see this option. Is this automatic? mxwp Hmm, can no longer set wallpapers directly from within the Photos app... most of mine are stored in the cloud. Local photos still set okay though. johnforamerica A recent update to the android app took away the individual cloud backup icons on each thumbnail. Since I do not (or want to) use the automatic backup, this creates a MAJOR usability issue. As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two unhelpful options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" Neither of those is an acceptable option. I'm baffled that Google would just remove this functionality without any sort of alternate option. Either way, Google should probably update it's own damn documentation: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e24ca7bc51ab7360dd512d35c6eb47f5dd6596a90f51a9930131c3e973a2baed.jpg Follow Android Police 1.51M 464k 141k 104k Latest Deals 23 [Deal Alert] Costco is offering $50 Google Play gift cards as low as $39.49 ($7.50) and $100 cards for $82.99 ($10 off) 2017/04/03 1:10pm PDTApr 3, 2017 39 [Deal Alert] Get a 2016 Sony XBR X850D 55" 4K HDR Android TV for just $769 ($230 off) from Buydig on eBay 2017/04/02 9:22pm PDTApr 2, 2017 7 Luma 2-pack is $179 ($71 off) on The Home Depot for today only 2017/03/31 4:15pm PDTMar 31, 2017 25 [Deal Alert] Get a Plugable USB-C meter for just $17.95 ($17 off) on Amazon 2017/03/31 10:56am PDTMar 31, 2017 47 [Deal Alert] Get a black unlocked Galaxy S7 for $400 ($176 off) 2017/03/31 6:32am PDTMar 31, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

(Reuters/Olivia Harris) Share Written by Corinne Purtill April 03, 2017 Hey! Psst? Wanna know what the cool teens are thinking these days? What hip slang they use? What multinational brands they enjoy? Then check out “It’s Lit: A guide to what teens think is cool,” a research publication by the people you think of when you think of cool: the Brand Team for Consumer Apps at Google! Cool matters! We know this because Google says it, right on the first page, next to a photo of a teen who looks exactly like the type of person a Google image search of “cool teen” would produce. He is holding a neon-green skateboard with perplexingly clean wheels. Do teens like holding skateboards these days, but not riding them? Give us the 4-1-1, “It’s Lit”! Cool skateboard! (Google) “It’s Lit” claims to be a window into the “the most informed and connected generation yet—Gen Z.” Gen Z, according to the Brand Team for Consumer Apps at Google (or BTFCAAG, as the teens probably say when they’re Snapchatting about it) are the 60 million people in the US born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s. This quarter of the US population has $44 billion in annual purchasing power, though that rises to $200 billion when their influence on parental buying comes into play, according to Google. “Unlike millennials, this group is ambitious, engaged, and feel like they can change the world,” Google notes, which is how any demographic with $200 billion of their parents’ money behind them should feel! (Also, millennials: worse than people older than them, and also people younger than them!) Google explains that teens use “cool” to mean “unique, impressive, interesting, amazing, or awesome.” That’s totally different from how non-teens use “cool,” which is usually something like “The other person in this small-talk conversation has finished speaking and I am not sure what else to say.” To find out what #brands teens think are cool, Google asked 1,100 teens to rank 122 brands based on how familiar they were with them (“Awareness”) and, more importantly, coolness. Whatsapp<Doritos<YouTube! (Google) Teens’ absolute favorite brand—and this is a total coincidence that BTFCAAG has no choice but to pass along—is YouTube, a Google property. The third coolest is Google. The 10th coolest is Chrome, Google’s web browser. Google is the coolest multinational conglomerate subsidiary there is! You don’t even have to take Google’s word for it. They also have quotes from Real Teens. Like “Female, 17, from suburban Florida,” who says: “Google is not only a powerful search engine, but great at everything it does, from email to documents.” Way to stick it to the man, Gen Z! The chart is also a great guide to what teens think is not cool. The single least-cool brand it is possible to be is the Wall Street Journal. Quartz is not on the chart at all. We bet Google asked and the teens said, “You mean the innovative digital news site designed for navigating the global economy? Cool is not even the word! More like thought-provoking and useful! Doesn’t even fit within this matrix, Google! Next question!” (Actually, we know they didn’t; Quartz wasn’t one of the 122 brands. Maybe next year.) The second least-cool brand is Vice. JC Penney is cooler than Vice. Yahoo is cooler than Vice. Sunglass Hut is cooler than Vice. Costco—which sells Kirkland Signature men’s pleated khakis by the pallet—is cooler than Vice! Teens are aware of nothing—well, except the Wall Street Journal—as uncool as Vice! Sounds like Vice didn’t pass the “lit-ness” test, am I right, teens? Teens? We’ll show ourselves out.

Parents then select specific days in which the pause will occur – this way they do not have to input the information every day.  ‘Scheduled Pause’ is the brainchild of Edith Chao, produce manage at Google, who was inspired while search for new tools for families. ‘I noticed that I was having trouble falling asleep. I’d check emails and surf the web late into the night,’ Chao explained. ‘Experimenting with options, I started using a timer on my computer to turn the internet off at 11 p.m.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Another nail in the coffin of the PC?

Share this article Share ‘The first night was a shock, but after a few nights I was ready to shut down earlier. ‘And I was more refreshed and rejuvenated in the morning.’  After speaking with other parents who worked with Google and friends who didn’t, she found that many parents faced the challenge of prying the device from their children at certain times in the day. Parents begin by selecting a suggested schedule such as bedtime or family time and choose a time frame for which the internet will pause on that person’s device. Parents then select specific days in which the pause will occur The new upgrade follows less than a month of another parent friendly tool released by Google, called Family Link. The new app provides parents with weekly and monthly activity reports and lets them set timers for how long their kid can use the device. Parents also have the power to remotely lock the smartphone and check its location in order to see their child's whereabouts.  The new upgrade follows less than a month of another parent friendly tool released by Google, called Family Link. The new app provides parents with weekly and monthly activity reports and lets them set timers for how long their kid can use the device  WHAT CAN FAMILY LINK CONTROL Family Link provides parents with weekly and monthly activity reports and limit how much time they can use the device.  Parents have the power to remotely lock your kid’s device when it’s time to play, study, or sleep. They can set limits for how long kids can  sue the device and bedtimes for when the phone completely shuts down. The parent friendly app also lets adults block and approve apps not suitable for children before they are downloaded from the Google Play Store. ‘When your child is ready for their first Android device, Family Link lets you create a Google Account for them, which is like your own account, and also helps you set certain digital ground rules that work for your family - like managing the apps your kid can use, keeping an eye on screen time, and setting a bedtime on your kid’s device,’ Pavini Diwanji, VP engineer at Google, said in the announcement. To use Family Link, parents will have to purchase a device for their child that runs Android Nougat (7.0) or higher. Then, download the app and create a Google Account for their kid. Finally, sign them into their new device, and parents can then use Family Link as well. The parent friendly app also lets them block and approve apps not suitable for children before they are downloaded from the Google Play Store. You can also see how much your child spends playing with their favorite apps with weekly or monthly activity reports – and you can also set daily screen time limits on their handset. Parents also have the power to remotely lock your kid’s device when it’s time to play, study, or sleep - and can set limits and bedtimes for when the phone completely shuts down. The parent friendly app also lets them block and approve apps not suitable for children downloaded from the Google Play Store. You can also see how much your child spends playing with their favorite apps with weekly or monthly activity reports ‘Starting today, parents across the U.S. can request an invite to the Family Link early access program,’ Diwanji shared. ‘After receiving an invite, parents with kids under 13 years old can download and try the Family Link app.’ ‘We’re just getting started, and we’ll be asking parents using Family Link for feedback about how to improve the experience before we make the app broadly available.’ HOW MUCH SCREEN TIME SHOULD YOUR CHILD HAVE?  0-5 years old  1. For children younger than 24 months, avoid any digital media use with the exception of video-chatting  2. For children 18 to 24 months of age, you can introduce digital media, but use it together with your child and avoid allowing the child to consume it alone  3. For children 2 to 5 years old, limit screen time to one hour per day of high-quality programming; watch with your children and help them understand what they are seeing how to apply it  4. No screen time one hour before bedtime  5. Avoid using screen time as the only method to soothe the child (the concern is that the child might not develop the ability to regulate emotion on their own)  6. Avoid fast-paced programs or apps with distracting or violent content  7. Monitor children’s media content; test apps before using them and ask the child what he or she thinks about the app  8. Bedrooms, meal times and playtimes with parents should be screen-free for both parents and child 9. See recommended hours of sleep and physical activity for your child with this 24-hour calculator.  School-age children (5-18 years old)   Too much screen time has been found to cause health problems among children - and Google is helping parents monitor their usage 1. Develop and be consistent in following family guidelines for media use; assess the types of media and how much is being consumed, and what is appropriate for the child 2. Place consistent limits on hours or type of media that can be used per day Promote one hour of daily physical activity and eight to 12 hours of sleep, depending on age  3. Try to not let children sleep with TVs, computers and smartphones in their bedrooms  4. Avoid media use in the hour leading up to bedtime  5. Have media-free times, like during family dinner, or create media-free areas at home  6. Relay these guidelines to babysitters or other caregivers  7. Have ongoing conversations with the child about online safety, whether it’s about cyberbullying, sexting, solicitations or compromising privacy  8. Have a network of trusted adults who will engage with the child through social media. Family Link appears to be a result of studies that warn parents about the dangers of too much screen time. And the obsession seems to be fed by parents, with four in five believing that gadgets aid development – in contrast to growing concern among medical experts.  The American Society of Paediatrics produced detailed guidelines linking screen time to the risk of a child becoming overweight for life, sleep disturbance and developmental problems. And the more time parents spent in front of a screen, the more their children did. A growing body of evidence suggests all this is having a devastating effect on mental and physical health.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 53 Plus 1 on G+ 137 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares273 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like the Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

Kappa saf1927 What is VR again? Ah, some shit that everyone likes to experience once and then realises it's shit. Morten Ulv I must have missed the part where it's shit. Kevin It was actually cool. It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD Adrian Meredith Hmm what? Vr is incredible can't go back to playing elite on a 2d screen Jesse Lee You must be using Daydream VR and not Oculus because you would have realized you're comment is complete shit. George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.) MicroNix And you think that would be fair when it was Samsung that was to market much earlier with VR than Google? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Sorry to break it to you. But cardboard was out in June of 2014. Gear vr didn't get released until like november of 2015. Over a year later. And at that time, it was basically just a plastic google cardboard. Willie Chalmers III Well, Cardboard was introduced at I/O in May 2014, and Gear VR was released in November 2015. Daydream was released in November 2016. Does that make it any more fair? It doesn't matter if it's fair, I'm just explaining Google's options. I'm not happy about the prospects, but I noted that Google could make Daydream a requirement for GMS at the risk of an antitrust lawsuit.

Willie Chalmers III Yeah, I noted that. That's the unfortunate reality of corporate politics. JohnyNoLegs Maybe since Samsung comes up with everything great in Android, Google should be the one using Samsung rather than the other way. Samsung Gear VR is and has been far better for ages. Kawshik Ahmed Google can't implement Gear VR to Android because it's not Open Source rather it is own by Oculus/Facebook. If a OEM share their technology with AOSP, Google have no problem to implement it, take for example Sony, who shared 50+ enhancement in Android O alone. X-47B or think Google - who don't add even the latest google search to AOSP. Is latest chrome, google assistant part of AOSP? Samsung shared KNOX with google, which they are not supposed to. Kawshik Ahmed Chrome has it's own Open Source form named Chromium so it doesn't need to be with AOSP. Anyone can use it like Opera and many others are doing. Google Search and Assistant are not features or enhancement nor part of the actual OS, they are services and it takes money to maintain the servers to run them. I don't think any company will make their services open sourced. It's like saying Samsung should open source Bixby which will never happen. blueman24 That would be good only if samsung made any polished software plus made it open source. JohnyNoLegs Google can't even do that so not sure what you are inferring. illregal Said no one ever. Samsung is a disease. Holding back true innovation with their lackluster devices. Diogo Neves Yeah, the competition really looks fierce for Samsung lol illregal buying reviews, paying to badmouth your competition, marketing dollars and dumbasses eating it up doesn't mean the device is any good. It means you've been had. JohnyNoLegs Sounds like Apple to me haha. Pixel isn't far behind... Good_Ole_Pinocchio No need to support Daydream. There's zero benefit to Samsung. MJ Yes, customer needs are of no concern to Samsung also like updates. billy routh Samsung has their own VR and it's Miles ahead of Google's crappy daydream. Chris Sanner that's...nice? but it means lock-in - if I'm on a nexus/pixel and I leave for a samsung phone...I lose what content I had. if I decide that's fine and move to samsung, if I want to leave and go back to a pixel I lose the content. that means I have to be willing to bet that I will *always* buy Samsung. and guess what - I'm not. Anthony820 And when I switch to Canon I lose all my Nikon lenses. And when I switch back I lose all my canon. And went I switched from iPhone I lost all my apps and had to re-purchase them for a new OS. I say everyone fully endorses their competition's ecosystem of services/products. Chris Sanner um...except this is like someone making a canon-based camera and refusing to support the new cannon attachments on the next release. that's kinda shitty and would be enough to keep me from buying the cannon-based camera OligarchyAmbulance "Miles ahead" lol ok Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of all customer needs, DayDream support is absolute last on that list. No need for it. They want VR? They'll get a freeheadset JohnyNoLegs Lol samsung VR??? And who needs breaking updates. MJ I am not sure why Samsung VR is so funny and... No updates for you huh? Are you one of those people still using Windows XP on their PC? JohnyNoLegs Samsung be is available for customers of Samsung, and it's far better than Daydream still. And no I'm on pixel xl running 7.1.2, but really it's the same as 7.0 so no benefit of having pixel for the past 5 months. AsterMK Daydream is far from a need. It's a want, and barely anyone wants VR in general. Of those that do want it, almost everyone prefers Gear VR. Ra1nb0wD4sh DE I would totally get a HTC Vive, but it's too expensive atm. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They want you to use GearVR MJ Yes, which is the opposite of giving customer choice aka what they may want. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Corporations don't care what you want Rob Cook Your argument is invalid, Samsung isn't forced to provide Daydream as they have developed, in their opinion a superior alternative. The customer choice here is to not buy Samsung if you feel that Daydream is the better product (arguably it's not). You logic is saying that Samsung MUST provide Daydream as well or there isn't a choice being offered at all. That's like saying that Cheverolet MUST offer a V12 quad-turbo in the Corvett because Bugatti offers one in the Chiron. Yes both are cars but that's it. MJ Ummmm The argument I never made is invalid? OK... Dude, I never said Samsung should be REQUIRED to provide Daydream support. I did infer Samsung should should give their customers options. LOL I do agree about NOT buying Samsung products. It is amazing to me all comments defending Samsung on this. Who doesn't like options and prefers a walled garden? Oh yeah... Your analogy was really stupid by the way. What I am saying is the what Ford does with their touch screen system in supporting Apples' CarPlay and Android Auto is better way to go than just supporting one or the other or using a proprietary only system. Jesse Lee Well then why didn't Google offer Oculus support on its Pixel phones....no customer support needs I guess. This was a no-brainer, I thought anyway but.... Dave I will not buy a S8 without Daydream. I was going to finally buy my first new phone since the Note 2, but now think I will wait for the Pixel 2. Mike549 They're losing my purchase of an s8 because of it. I already have the s7 with gear VR but I want access to Daydream too. YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They chose not to support it because they are not idiots. Why would they risk losing VR market share? MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. illregal Samsung copied google here.. There's no debate, gear vr came out way after cardboard. samsung pay, etc.. All out after google. Samsung hasn't had an original thought in years, unless it has to do with ripping off their idiot customers. JohnyNoLegs I didn't know Cardboard had sensors in it..... I thought it was just a piece of cardboard with a lense... dhamp2g Cardboard was 1st dude!!! JohnyNoLegs Then VR with actual sensors and lag free use came out... DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. illregal oculus is proprietary crap and losing badly to vive. Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Ryan IMHO Gear and daydream provide the very same experience in term of quality. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Mike549 Verizon stores have Daydream devices for demo purposes. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. Klark Kenneth Wait, are you saying it's a fail or are you saying "No? FAIL."? MJ "Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL." What the hell is that supposed to mean? Jesse Lee Dude, stop trolling. Nexus phones were made by Google, the N6 was less then 2 years old when Daydream VR came out and Google didn't even support it. Yet, you're comments seem to contradict that reality and keep bashing Sammy when Google's support is much much worse when it comes to VR. You're barking up the wrong tree is how the expression goes and its apparent from reading this section. MJ Speak about trolling... The OP statement I quoted made so sense so I asked him to explain it. What does that have to do with you buddy? Daydream is NOT supported on the Nexus 6? So what? You need minimal hardware support for a good experience so it's better than something like Cardboard. FACT: Samsung’s first consumer Gear VR headset didn't support any previous Samsung phones either. FACT: Goggle Daydream is open to other OEMs while Samsung's VR solution is NOT. Now go away... Mike549 Agreed. I think the same applies to the Rift and Vive for exclusive too. Ryan The most targeted platform is Cardboard... ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Sudev Together but not the same :) Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. Ryan I disagree it's a bit like the console/PC war non sense. While I understand people might want to only experience it on PC for obvious reasons there are a lot of smaller players that are enjoying mobile VR a lot. While it's true there is a lot of crap in the store there are some really good games. Jon Fridman VR on phones doesn't look anywhere near as good based on experience. Consoles are irrelevant to this as well because they still don't have the raw power a PC can (yes thst includes the PS VR headset). While the graphics may look decent, they can't compare to higher end systems. Once VR has matured I think it'll be fine to use on phones. In the current state I cannot see a reason to use a VR headset. I won't buy one for my PC either despite having a more than capable set up (i7 6800K/EVGA 1080FTW/32GB RAM). When the next generation comes out I'll likely buy one. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol op12 Daydream expanded beyond the Pixel a while ago... https://vr.google.com/daydream/phones/#daydream-ready-phones Jesse Lee Yeah, it works great on any phone now named Pixel Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Atoqir Well that is saying like "Why do my PS4 exclusives don't work on Xbox" There is always some artificial lockout to make a platform more attractive. And I don't think it's a bad thing. It makes competitors do better and create the best platform for the biggest chunk of users. And the least popular loses and doesn't have a vibrant ecosystem. Look at Windows Mobile as prime example. Cause we are not talking about regular hardware products anymore. These days every products is a weapon the "wars of the ecosystems/platforms" Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Ryan VR is not pleasing for everyone.But there are a lot of people that love it. kalehv Oh I love it too. but there's not much to do yet. Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR. Ryan And this is why, as a VR Dev , I only target cardboard for now. Hope the VR future will be brighter and easier for everyone! It is a really good medium. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So you'd rather target a limited audience rather than a large one? How is this a good business decision? darkvadur 1 April??..... Sudev Together but not the same :) Mike549 I was going to get the S8 if it supported both platforms but not now. I'll just keep my S7 and get a Daydream compatible phone if an interesting one comes out soon. Sean Thomas to be fair...daydream is bad. I haven't used Gear VR, but Daydream isn't worth it right now if they already have a platform with more support. Daydream shouldn't be on par with oculus if it's bad tbh. Google should just work with oculus to make an android-wide deal. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Serious question: Does the Pixel / Pixel XL support Gear VR? Jordan L probably not, I'm guessing Gear VR is a Samsung exclusive thing. Whereas Daydream is available to all. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Isn't Gear VR the same VR as Oculus? If so, it's not Samsung exclusive. Jordan L I don't know. I thought it was called Samsung Gear VR. Oculus has a VR framework that is available to cell phone makers? If that's true, then Daydream should work work that, I agree. A big part of Daydream was the ability for other companies to join in. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I googled it. Yes, Samsung Gear VR is powered by Oculus. So it's probably going to have the most content, which is what will make it the most successful VR. If it turns out Daydream gets the most content, then I'm sure Samsung will support it. Otherwise they'll lose customers. This is no different than prior format wars like Betamax vs. VHS or HD DVD vs. Blu-ray. Whoever gets the most content wins. Jordan L Fragmentation. Google allows all companies to attempt to do Daydream... so Samsung does their own thing. Chris Sanner Dear Samsung: this sort of shit is why I refuse to buy any more of your phones. like, ever. dhamp2g WTF this type of shit kills me. Why wouldn't google make it required to use android?????. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Why does it bother you? If Daydream wins the VR competition, then Samsung will either lose customers or be forced to support Daydream. If Gear VR wins, then Google and Daydream phones will either lose customers or be forced to support it. That's the way the free market works. dhamp2g bc I bought a daydream when it was on sale bc I though 4sure that the s8 would support it. I will get the next pixel when it comes out and ditch my s8 and use my s7 for gearVR. I wanted one phone for both. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck with that! I don't care about VR, but if I did, I'd get the phone that supports VR with the most content. That's what determines the end game. Suicide_Note VR is crap, and anything that speeds its demise is fine by me. https://media0.giphy.com/media/d4aTnvQuF6xyfgWI/giphy.gif kgptzac Anyone with a brain should not find this surprising, and should be easily see the reasons behind it. Once again the burden falls to developers to either make exclusives, or games that support multiple VR platforms. It's not unfair either... developers have always been choosing between sony and microsoft on consoles, and google and apple on mobile, so it's fair game. likurges daydream is a gimmick. useless crap in it's current form. On the other hand samsung is an ass for not supporting it Averix No great loss. VR is a fad for right now. The lack of content makes that obvious. Since they're giving away a headset for the Samsung Oculus experience, I don't think Daydream matters much here. Jesse Lee "Could" be Samsung's deal with Oculus?! Absolutely it has to do with the competing VR platform offered by Oculus. I guess I never would have thought they were going to and never got hopes up for it just the same as I never thought the Pixel was going to include Oculus software, kind of a no-brainer really. Jordan L It's possible the Samsung could support both VR's, and maybe Oculus is elusive to Samsung? So pixel couldn't support both platforms. If that's true, then one could hope Samsung would support both.(it was a long shot). Daydream is open to all manufactures... Is Oculus?

Name: Subject: Message: Google Wifi app update adds a way to turn the router on or off automatically Newsby John Callaham8 hours ago 1 120 4 Sometimes, it might be a good idea to just turn off the internet. Maybe you are cooking dinner or reading a book, or playing with your kids. But if you have a Wi-Fi home network, it can be hard to just get completely away; the temptation is always there to check your phone or tablet for a new text message or email. Today, Google is rolling out an update to its Google Wifi app that will allow owners of its wireless hardware products to schedule a time to turn off the internet. See also: Future Wi-Fi hardware may use infrared light for faster connections 2 weeks ago The new feature is called Scheduled Pause, and it came from an idea that Edith Chao, the project manager for Google Wifi, had while she was looking into adding tools into the app for families. She says she personally found it hard to go to sleep because she found herself checking emails or surfing the internet late at night. When she finally decided to have her computer turn off the internet at a pre-selected time, she found herself going to sleep and getting up in the morning with more rest than before. That’s the logic that went into the new Scheduled Pause feature. It offers up some ideas for scheduled down time for your Google Wifi or OnHub router, or you can create your own schedule. While the update is being put in place mostly to help parents control the internet access for their kids, the truth it this feature can be helpful for anyone who needs to be forced to get off the net to do other chores, or just to go to sleep at a reasonable hour. If you own a Google Wifi or OnHub router, will you use this update to the Google Wifi app? Let us know what you will do in the comments!

[Shutterstock - Georgejmclittle - 319423463]    Google Android Apps Are Colluding, Sharing Users’ Data Without Consent Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 5:03 PM 04/03/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5570506 Thousands of applications on Google’s Android operating system “collude” to share users’ phone data without consent, leaving phones vulnerable to hackers, according to a new study. “This is the first time we’ve found real-world evidence that apps are colluding with one another,” Gang Wang, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech, told The Hill. “Apps are talking to each other to get information when they don’t have permission to do so.” As mobile phones become omnipresent, researchers at Virginia Tech sought to discover to what extent trusted apps on Android phones are able to talk to one another and trade information, and the subsequent implications. (Wang clarified that they already knew apps communicated with each other). “What this study shows undeniably with real-world evidence over and over again is that app behavior, whether it is intentional or not, can pose a security breach depending on the kinds of apps you have on your phone,” Wang said on the official Virginia Tech press release. Essentially, Wang is alluding to the fact that cybercriminals install thousands of malicious apps in third-party stores for Android. (RELATED: Hackers Are Gunning For Your Personal Data By Tricking You) If malware-infested apps collude with unsuspecting authentic apps, then cybercriminals can then be granted access to data from other apps directly on the phone system, like Gmail, Google Play, Google Photos, Google Docs, Google Drive, and several others. Such a method is exactly how hackers were able to breach more than 1 million Google Android accounts, in what Forbes considers the largest theft of Google data in history. “Of the apps we studied, we found thousands of pairs of apps that could potentially leak sensitive phone or personal information and allow unauthorized apps to gain access to privileged data,” said Daphne Yao, associate professor at Virginia Tech. The team of researchers studied 110,150 apps over three years, and found that the the biggest security risks were usually from apps like personalizations of ringtones, widgets, and emoticons. (RELATED: There Are At Least 170 Million Internet-Connected Devices Susceptible To Hacking In The U.S.) “App security is a little like the Wild West right now with few regulations. We hope this paper will be a source for the industry to consider re-examining their software development practices and incorporate safeguards on the front end,” Wang concluded in the press release. “While we can’t quantify what the intention is for app developers in the non-malware cases we can at least raise awareness of this security problem with mobile apps for consumers who previosuly (sic) may not have thought much about what they were downloading onto their phones.” Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

The title alone should immediately remind you of that Steve Buscemi GIF, but the entire document contains little nuggets of painfully sincere guidance for those who, when confronted with a teen, tilt their head to one side, scratch some dandruff from their scalp, and let out a loud, adult-ish “Huh?” Below are six things I learned from the academic paper colloquially known as It’s Lit. 1. “Teens feel something is cool if it’s unique, impressive, interesting, amazing or awesome.” The study opens strong with a number of synonyms for “cool.” Unfortunately, it is written without the Oxford comma, and it’s widely known there’s nothing cooler to teens than grammatical clarity. Google Google Google 2. Teens think Doritos are cooler than Vice and Whatsapp. When asked to rank brands by coolness, teens ranked Vice, Line, and Sunglass Hut near the bottom, each with fewer than 5 coolness points out of 9. Google, YouTube, Netflix, and Doritos ranked the highest. 3. Uber is cooler for Millennials than it is for Gen Z. Probably because parents are the original Uber. Google 4. The iPhone vs. Android wars are neck-and-neck in Gen Z. Of the teens surveyed, 42.3 percent have an iPhone, while 41.3 percent are on Android. Only 3.1 percent have a Windows Phone — at least they have this subreddit. 5. “Gen Z is the most informed, evolved, and empathetic generation of its kind.” Assuming “of its kind” means, um, humans, I have a hard time imagining how even the smartest market analytics PowerPoint artist could determine that millions of people as a single group defined solely by age are more evolved than the rest. 6. “According to teens, pizza, Oreos, chips, and ice cream are cool.” Gen Z may be more evolved, but they are still weak to the very same snacks that doomed Millennials, Gen-X, and Baby Boomers. The report is based on the results of three surveys conducted in 2016. Market research firm YouGov administered two surveys to a total of around 1,500 teens and 800 people aged 18 to 25. Another market research firm, Gutcheck, administered a survey to around 67 teens. Although the survey sample sizes are relatively small, the results apparently all concluded the same thing: that teens think Google is cool. Surely data that claims 40 percent of teens use Google+ isn’t skewed in the least. In honor of the optimistic, evolved teens, let’s just chalk this up to a stroke of luck for Google, the very cool company that commissioned this study in the first place. in all, this study is a great piece of native advertising for google services pic.twitter.com/CyvOQBxIYy— Maya Kosoff (@mekosoff) April 3, 2017 The PDF has apparently been circulating for weeks on the Gen Z underbelly of the internet, but the knowledge within its mysterious pages should last a lifetime.

Need a break from the internet? Google Wifi—a mesh network aimed to deliver problem-free wireless signals to your entire home—will now let you schedule times to cut your web connection. The feature, called Scheduled Pause, is hardly new: conventional routers from the likes of Linksys and Netgear have offered it pretty much since the dawn of home networking. But they are often buried in clumsy and hard-to-access router administration software. On the other hand, Google Wifi's ability to control which devices on your network have access to the internet at any given time is notable for its simplicity, which means people actually might use it. Set up Scheduled Pause through the Google Wifi app; no passwords to enter or router administration URLs to remember. Each pause you create can have custom start and end times, and can be applied only certain devices on the network. The obvious benefit of this is that you could create a group that includes all the devices used by your kids, which could be switched off during dinner and between bedtime and wakeup. Related The Best Wi-Fi Mesh Network Systems of 2017 The Best Wi-Fi Mesh Network Systems of 2017 But the ability to easily schedule internet downtime is also an exercise in willpower that could offer significant health benefits. There's a growing medical consensus that using a computer or other electronic device before bed can disrupt sleep patterns. So setting an internet cutoff for yourself of, say, 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. might help you be more well-rested. "The first night was a shock, but after a few nights I was ready to shut down earlier," Google Product Manager Edith Chao wrote of her experience trying pauses. "And I was more refreshed and rejuvenated in the morning." Of course, in practice the easy-to-use nature of Google Wifi's Scheduled Pause feature might actually make it less suited to enforcing an internet blackout: even if you resist the temptation to open the app and temporarily unpause your phone, it's probably even easier to turn off your Wi-Fi antenna and escape the bounds of your home network by connecting to LTE.

Tesla Is Worth More Than Ford How To Make Your Social Media Accounts As Private As Possible Google: Please Don't Look At Our Very Tiny Ad Problem Libby Watson Apr 4, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  advertising google youtube Share It's been a tough few weeks for Google. Several companies have pulled their ads from its network after various news outlets revealed that those ads have appeared on extremist, racist or otherwise offensive videos. But never fear. A Google executive says the problem is, actually, small. And not just very small, in fact. Not even very, very small. But very, very, very small. Philipp Schindler, left, in 2010 (Image: Getty) In a new interview with Recode, Google's chief business officer, Philip Schindler, downplayed the seriousness of the problem: "It has always been a small problem," with "very very very small numbers" of ads running against videos that aren't "brand- safe," says Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler. "And over the last few weeks, someone has decided to put a bit more of a spotlight on the problem." Schindler specifically claimed the "error rates" — as in the number of ads appearing on offensive videos — "are tiny, tiny". A Google spokesperson later told Recode: "When we spoke with many of our top brand advertisers, it was clear that the videos they had flagged received less than 1/1000th of a per cent of the advertisers' total impressions." But those videos, even if they were 0.001 per cent of advertisers' impressions, caused huge problems for Google — and threatened its massive revenue stream. Several outlets, including the UK Times and the Wall Street Journal, published evidence of ads appearing on racist, anti-Semitic and extremist videos over the past few weeks, which led to several huge companies pulling their ads, including AT&T and Walmart. This doesn't exactly seem like a "small problem", and that much is clear from Google's response — it announced changes to its policies to allow advertisers more control over where its ads appear, and recently promised to train its AI to better detect content that a brand wouldn't want its ads anywhere near. But judging by Schindler's comments, it seems like Google is primarily concerned not with the problem itself, but rather that people are paying attention. Saying that "someone", that is, several news outlets, has "decided to put a bit more of a spotlight on the problem" really makes it sound like Google is a lot more troubled by the criticism than the problem itself. Schindler even went on to say that the "problem comes from the fact that somebody is aggressively putting it onto the front page". Ah, yes. The "problem" for Google is less the overlap of Good brands and Bad videos, and more the annoying fact that people keep talking about it. How pesky. [The Guardian] WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Apr 4, 2017, 7:42am Ultimately the magnitude of this problem came down to perception, and that perception was driven by news reports. It's not the first time the media or small vocal sections of public response have driven companies to disproportionately large responses, they're very concerned with public image. Companies pulling all advertising was never a reasonable response but it was one that telegraphed to the rolling internet boycott machine not to target them for something no reasonable person would blame them for in the first place. Google's adjusting the algorithm and as soon as the media coverage dies down and the threat to companies' public images subsides it'll be back to business as usual. Don't get me wrong, I loathe all the drama and hate speech that's all over Youtube. But I'm not silly enough to think Holden supports someone calling Ita Buttrose an old hag just because their ad appeared before the video. Reply 4 vangrat @vangrat Apr 4, 2017, 7:52am https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarmwsuR9sDRObyU/giphy.gif Reply 2 Cameron @moonhead Apr 4, 2017, 8:36am Everyone seems to be ignoring the fact Google allows these types of videos, provides support for them, and profits off them. The question should be, not what Google is doing to fix their ad serving algorithm, but instead, why they're not pulling these videos before they even get to having ads on them? Reply 0 Roland @roland Apr 4, 2017, 8:42am ahh you know how many hours of video are loaded onto YouTube every minute? Reply 1 zeitxgeist @zeitxgeist Apr 4, 2017, 8:49am Do you have a spare few billion to bankroll the systems and staff necessary to police it? The staff alone required to sift through hundreds of thousands of hours of content to pull out the overtly awful stuff would be unfathomable. 300 hours of footage is uploaded every minute. Insane. Reply 1 anteaters @anteaters Apr 4, 2017, 9:10am Remember reading somewhere it would take 60,000 years of non-stop watching to watch each and every video on YouTube as there are approximately 81,941,760 videos on youtube which by the time you have read this sentence would have increased. Reply 1 Cameron @moonhead Apr 4, 2017, 11:14am Not my money, Google is the one making the money here. You also don't need to watch every video, just the ones that want to monitise with ads. Also, reporting systems can, and should, be used to flag inappropriate content, which Google should be removing. Reply 0 Archfiend @travisnew87 Apr 4, 2017, 9:55am Not all videos being vilified are bad but are only bad to a particular demographic. A recent one was a YouTuber showing how the UK government was potentially supplying their officers with "stab proof" safety vest which wasn't stab proof and he was doing a video to expose them. Some outlets said he was glorifying and showing people how to kill officers when in fact he was shaming the government into providing proper support and equipment for their public servants. Take a step back realise that each person only has their own slice of truth and you need to know the whole story before condemning any individuals actions. Reply 1 Cameron @moonhead Apr 4, 2017, 11:16am There are very clear cut cases that could be excluded if proper rules were in place. They already do this for Muslim extremists, but seem to ignore the white nationalists. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d Apr 4, 2017, 10:15am Oh shit, thought police have an avid supporter. Frankly I don't agree with hate speech but I'm not going to pretend that removing anyones freedom of speech is anything but draconian. It is this exact attitude that is corroding social equality and enabling hate speech. You should be engaging in discussion and learning how to hold conversations. It's obvious they're upset about something regardless of your opinion. So help them to see why it's wrong and if you cant do that, don't say anything at all because you're making the situation worse. I am of course talking about people in our own communities. Other societies may simply just have different values which you cant change. eg clash of religions. Reply 0 Cameron @moonhead Apr 4, 2017, 11:12am It's not freedom of speech. People can say whatever they want. There's no inherent right to have a platform to spew hate speech from, however. The difference is a right to response. When a single person says something, other people are on equal footing to reply. When someone has a platform to spread their message, people who disagree with that message can't respond in an equal way.

None of the channels with "hate speech" on YouTube started with thousands of subs or viewers, they built that up by providing content that those viewers wanted. You have the exact same opportunity on YouTube as everyone else. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Streaming music came not long after -- Spotify was founded in 2008, and competitors were close on its heels. In 2017, the answer you'd get could not be more different. Vinyl is cool again, as much as it ever has been if not moreso. The power of the internet, too, is changing the way that vinyl records are thought up and sold. NBN Rollout Will Skip Difficult Connections, Could Take Years To Circle Back Logan Booker 02 Apr 2017 12:30 PM No one said building a fast, nation-wide broadband network would be easy. But imagine if the NBN skipped your house or business because it wasn't easy enough? A report by the ABC's Emily Laurence has revealed that if a property is "categorised as Service Class 0", NBN Co will almost certainly give it a miss, even if you're in a rollout area.

You need a sunny roof to benefit from solar panels, but yours may be sunnier than you think. Google’s Project Sunroof gives building-by-building details, and now has data for (parts of) all 50 states. Search for your house, and take a look: sunny spots are in yellow, shady ones in purple. Google also provides estimates of how many hours of sunlight your roof sees, how much area is available for solar panels, and how much a solar panel installation could save you over the years. It also has details on financing and more. That makes it a great place to start thinking about whether it makes sense to install solar panels.

But scanning across the map, I see plenty of places—even a few blocks away—where solar panels would make sense and could save money over time. Google’s tools include calculators for individual buildings, but also statistics on entire cities or areas. City planners might like to see how many roofs are suitable for solar power, for example (57 percent in my area), and the amount of power they could produce.

Some of the biggest brands in the US have pulled hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising from Google and YouTube after their brands were promoted next to extremist content. Google has now admitted that its computers struggle to "understand context" and said it is using its "greatest machine learning abilities" to try to solve the issue. 400 hours of new content are uploaded to YouTube every minute  Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg In an interview with The New York Times Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, said that the company has been in "emergency mode" over the issue of extremist content. "We take this as seriously as we've ever taken a problem," he said. Google is now training its computers to recognise videos which are offensive by analysing them on a frame-by-frame basis and comparing it with descriptions of content. It said it hoped to teach its computers to understand the context of footage, so that videos which are easily recognised by people as offensive will be flagged by its computers. Philipp Schindler of Google Credit: Andrew Fox  Mr Schindler said: "Computers have a much harder time understanding context, and that’s why we’re actually using all of our latest and greatest machine learning abilities now to get a better feel for this." The company hopes that it's programmed will be able to identify the difference between a movie star waving a gun and an extremist. However, the company said that it will never be able to solve the problem completely as 400 hours of new content are uploaded to YouTube every minute. "No system can be 100 percent perfect,” he said. “But we’re working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible.” More than 250 organisations including the British government, Toyota, Tesco and McDonald’s stopped UK advertising on YouTube it emerged that they were being promoted on videos posted by hate preachers, rape apologists and extremists banned in Britain. Companies that have withdrawn advertising from Google Google had changed which videos can carry advertising and given them the power to fine-tune the types of content that they want to approve. Last week Google and some of the world’s biggest internet companies agreed to create new “technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda” in the wake of the Westminster terrorist attacks. The companies which also included Facebook and Twitter also agreed to look at "options" for a body “to accelerate” how they take down extremist content. However they were criticised for paying “lip service” to the problem by failing to commit fully to setting up an industry body to tackle the problem. Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, summoned executives from Google, Twitter, Facebook and Microsoft to a summit at the Home Office after the Westminster terrorist attacks last week. After the meeting the companies agreed to “look at all options for structuring a forum to accelerate and strengthen” their work to tackle online extremism. This would “enhance and broaden the current informal collaboration sessions that companies already conduct”.

Android Pay v1.19 prepares to show full transaction histories even when Pay isn't used, adding support for Nanaco cards in Japan soon [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 3:49am PDTMar 31, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares139 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Nanaco card support (Japan) 1.2 code 1.3 Hiding sensitive information from view 1.4 Full transaction histories, even when Android Pay isn't used 2 Download Android Pay v1.19 began rolling out last night, but like many of the its recent updates, there aren't any obvious new features to see after updating. However, a teardown of the app does show there are a few things in the works, or maybe even ready to launch in the near future. Supported cards will soon allow Android Pay to show full transaction history, even if the purchase was made outside of Android Pay. It will soon be possible to block sensitive data from appearing on screen, which will prevent prying eyes from stealing that information. And finally, Japanese users can look forward to support for the Nanaco payment card. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Nanaco card support (Japan) Back in December, Google announced its first official Android Pay partner in Japan would be Rakuten. This obviously wasn't going to be the only payment method to join the club, and now it looks pretty likely that the Nanaco card by Seven will become the second. For those unfamiliar with Nanaco card, and I assume most of our readers are, it's a prepaid eMoney card accepted at various payment terminals in Japan. There are quite a few similarities between Nanaco and Rakuten Edy. In fact, they're similar enough that my original teardown revealing the Rakuten Edy partnership covers most of the salient points. code <string name="seven_company_name">Seven card service</string> <string name="how_to_use_nanaco">How to use nanaco</string> <string name="instore_topup_education_subtitle">Then you can use Android Pay wherever nanaco is accepted</string> <string name="instore_topup_education_title">Your nanaco card was created.

If you have any question, please reach out to nanaco customer support (0570–071–555). nanaco number: %1$s Error code: AMBE10</string> <string name="nanaco_information_share_disclaimer">By continuing, you agree to share this info with nanaco</string> <string name="nanaco_name">nanaco</string> <string name="nanaco_sign_up_form_message">Enter your info to create a nanaco account</string> <string name="nanaco_too_young_error">Must be at least 16 years old</string> <string name="nanaco_tos_link_label">Terms and Conditions of nanaco mobile</string> It's never safe to predict launch dates, but the teardown for the Rakuten Edy card was followed only a few days later by an official announcement, and the same thing could certainly happen again with Nanaco. Unlike the launch of Rakuten Edy support, there's no mention of promotional incentives for signing up. Hiding sensitive information from view Security has been a major factory in the evolution of our smartphones, but there are still gaps where information can leak in one way or another. One of the easiest ways for somebody to get some of your information is simply by looking at it when your phone is showing it. Google seems to be planning to remedy this with a couple of new buttons that allow users to individually hide the barcode and member ID for cards. <string name="hide_barcode_link">Hide barcode</string> <string name="hide_member_id_link">Hide member ID</string> It seems odd to single out these two things and not offer it for other sensitive fields, but it's certainly possible for Google to add more in the future. There aren't any clear indicators about what will appear in place of the barcode and member ID, but I suspect they will be simple replacements, like asterisks for the member ID and a black box for the barcode. Full transaction histories, even when Android Pay isn't used If you've used Android Pay for a little while, there's a good chance you've noticed that it only tracks transactions made with Android Pay itself, not those made directly with the card or through non-physical means (e.g. online purchases). This isn't too surprising since Google would need access to transaction history direct from the provider of the payment card to fill in the gaps. As it turns out, that's something Google is actually going to do. New lines of text appear in the latest update saying that some cards will be able to show full transaction history, even for those made outside of Android Pay. This is limited to just those cards that support it, and that list might be fairly short to begin with. <string name="payment_card_setting_heading">Non-Android Pay Transactions</string> <string name="payment_card_setting_subheading">Display transactions made outside of Android Pay.</string> <string name="payment_card_setting_subsubheading">For cards that support this feature.</string> Since there's no mention of entering login name and password, it seems like Google must be working out deals with providers rather than opening an account and merely scraping for the history like many financial tracking services have been known to do. There's actually not much more to take away from the limited text that's here, so that's going to be it for this one. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Yay. Tony Pettinato Simple is the only card you have? 2kool4skool "Only"? People have more than one card? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...Yes? Many/most people have multiple credit cards in addition to their checking account. 2kool4skool Consumerism at its best. Lucky for me I guess, I never feel the needs to have more than one card. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Plenty of reasons beyond mere consumerism, but cool, whatever makes you happy. Kevin Sword Having a credit card is a good idea, but having multiple isn't really necessary. When you need a loan, and for other financial things, having a credit history is pretty important. Adam Margeson And part of credit history is having lots of credit accounts. Honestly, open up about 10-15 credit cards, make an occasional small purchase on each of them but otherwise just leave them in a drawer. ~20+ credit accounts (CCs, loans and otherwise) with an average age of over 5 years makes for "excellent" credit history, given you don't max them or forget to pay. Kevin Sword Having recurring transactions like bills or subscriptions on cards is a great idea, and have it auto-debit from your bank account. But 10-15 is really excessive. It actually really hurts your credit score to have multiple pulls to open new accounts. You also have to be mindful of the minimum spending and other restrictions. Check out reddit.com/r/churning for the ultimate in credit card schemes. Adam Margeson I completely agree that doing so will ding your credit, but those are minor dings that happen *every time* you ask for credit. Get the cards over a year or so and two years after the last application, all of the 1-2 point "dings" will go away and your "average credit age" will start increasing at a much better rate than getting that many credit accounts over a decade or two. Adam Margeson And, about the minimum spending, just make sure to go with cards that don't have minimum spending limits. Roh_Mish Don't know about US but here many stores tie up with banks for credit/debit card only discounts on that bank. Dee Norbert Transaction history will be available in Europe next year when PSD2 will be applied to banks. And they will make an API. 4Ui812 So if people use Samsung pay for purchases Google will still have access that information ? I understand that using android the answer should be a obvious yes but I don't like it. Google will find some monetary value in this information. I'm sure Samsung sells it but that's beside the point. Jens Knutson This will be an opt in feature. There's no way they'll just declare that they get to *download your payment history* without asking. Adam Margeson Hate to say it, but there's probably a loophole where "you agreed when you added the card into Android Pay in the first place." I might be wrong, though. poop. No, Android Pay and Samsung Pay are entirely separate financial services, that compete with each other. They are in no way linked. Neither Google or Samsung would be able to sell or use your purchase history for anything without notifying you of such a huge thing Brandon Edge I agree with the point about selling the data, but I think what they were referring to was that if you link your card to both services, if you make a payment with Samsung pay, and have the transaction history feature enabled, it'll show the transaction in android pay as well. Which should be true. Thor It's really a perfect time to launch Android Pay here in India when the country is moving towards cashless modes of payments. Samsung Pay is already here. Roh_Mish Problem is we still don't have nfc enabled terminals in many places and the laws for contactless payments is unclear and too restrictive at best. wickets I wish there was a way that android pay captured POS receipts....what a win-win that would be tj This is the feature I've been wanting for a long time, digital receipts would make managing returns so much easier. Ailín Ó’S I really wish it showed more than just the last 10 transactions used with Pay though.

Embattled engineer Anthony Levandowski collected $120 million from Google, despite involvement with at least one start-up that would ultimately compete with the company, according to new legal filings. Levandowski was already trying to staff up his competing start-up, Otto, while he worked at Google — but he waited until he got his payout to make the details of Otto public, a lawsuit said. Levandowski is at the nexus of a battle between what is now Alphabet's self-driving car company, Waymo, and ride-hailing start-up Uber. Waymo alleges that Levandowski stole thousands of documents and trade secrets for Otto, which went on to be rapidly acquired by Uber. (Uber calls these claims "baseless.") show chapters Judge tells Uber's key witness to testify or face an injunction    Friday, 31 Mar 2017 | 10:29 AM ET | 00:46 New court documents allege that Levandowski's conflicts of interest may have been much deeper. Not only did Levandowski try to poach Google employees, the lawsuit said, but he may have been involved in competing side businesses called Odin Wave and Tyto Lidar. Levandowski denied having ownership interested in Odin Wave when questioned in mid-2013, the lawsuit said, and also helped Google do due diligence for a potential acquisition of Tyto — a company that Otto later acquired. "Throughout this process, Levandowski never disclosed a relationship with Tyto and its employees," the lawsuit said. "Google now believes that Levandowski in fact had a relationship with Tyto and its employees that conflicted with Levandowski's duties to Google." Levandowski hasn't been the only engineer to get hefty sums from Waymo. In the suit, Google said it has had to provide incentives" to convince numerous other employees not to follow Levandowski to Uber. Uber and Waymo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg has previously reported that high paychecks prompted attrition at Google's car project. Bloomberg also reported that Levandowski had a long history of side projects during his time at Google, many sanctioned by founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. "Anthony is a rogue force of nature," former Google self-driving car executive told Bloomberg. "Each phase of his Google career he had a separate company doing exactly the same work." Levandowski has invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination in the lawsuit, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. Lawyers for Levandowski could no immediately be reached.

Salone Monitor.com Online Reviews By Salone Monitor Search Main menu Skip to primary content Home Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Post navigation ← Previous Next → Images of Tattoos – The Best Way to Find Good Tattoo Designs Online Posted on April 3, 2017 by admin When thinking about an image of tattoos the best way to find good tattoo designs online is to skip over the larger search engines. Many tattoo image searchers swear by using Google and Yahoo and the other various larger online search engines. Since this is not a review against those machines of information gathering, we will stick to the essence of the topic, great images of tattoos. Those large search engines are really great for certain times and searches. Quite the contrary if it was not for Google and the other search engines the Internet would be a haphazard dangerous place to research and also do business upon. The difference in searching for images of tattoos on a big search engine and finding really good tattoo designs online is a matter of originality and black and white differences. The images of tattoos that are scattered throughout the Internet these days, can lead to some confusing search options. Do not let this happen to you and do not be worried by the plethora of good tattoo designs that are online these days. Relax, please, and allow me the chance to find some really good portals for some of the best tattoo design sites on the Internet. This does not mean that I am going to regurgitate a listing of biased tattoo design sites that I want you to go to. This is only to say that I will show you a method in which to locate the sites for yourselves, and judge for yourselves, which ones are really good and which ones are not so much. Before we delve into finding good tattoo designs online let’s talk a little bit about the reasons behind not using the big search engines. When searching for a nice lamp for Aunt Mildred’s living room, the big search engines are great for this endeavor. When searching for images and tattoos that are against the grain and open to perception, the big search engines are not so good for this endeavor. What you need to do is to go to the forums and blogs postings of the underside of the tattoo artist’s world where the real artists are, and where they present their best works of art. Devoid of commercialism and keyword pushes, the underbelly of the tattoo artist realm is one of the most fantastic imaginary places to be online. Here you’ll find thousands of images at tattoos from apples to pigs in a blanket the limits are only in the realm of the imagination and not online are physical on the skin. Think of searching the images for tattoos much like walking through an art gallery with only the finest paintings and sculptures available from the hand of man kind. This is what it’s like rummaging around the soft underbelly of the tattoo artist world online. By searching only for the blogs and forums for tattoo artists around the world you’ll only see what you were meant to see, everything. By opening up your mind and creating a portal you will see that the online world is a fascinating place and if searched correctly you will only find something befitting of such a wondrous human form.

So far, though, many brands are still playing hard to get. By Seth Fiegerman NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Google is pulling out all the stops to win back advertisers after a big brand boycott last month over extremist content. So far, though, many brands are still playing hard to get. A spokesperson for Google said Monday it will begin working with "trusted" third-party firms to better identify offensive YouTube content that brands may not want to place ads next to. Google also said it is now relying on artificial intelligence to pinpoint content that could be objectionable to advertisers. An investigation published last month by The Times in London revealed that ads from companies like the BBC and L'Oreal were placed near content on YouTube posted by religious extremists, a Ku Klux Klan leader and more. That finding prompted an advertiser exodus in the UK and US. AT&T, Verizon, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase and others all confirmed suspending ads on YouTube. Despite Monday's announcement, reps for AT&T, Verizon, General Motors and FX Networks told CNNTech there is no reversal yet of their earlier decisions to halt ads. (AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.) Other brands, including Coca Cola, Walmart, Starbucks and Chase, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Only Johnson & Johnson confirmed changing its mind -- in select markets. "Johnson & Johnson has resumed YouTube digital advertising in a number of select countries following the implementation of increased brand protection measures by Google," Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement. The muted brand reaction highlights the challenge Google faces in fully moving past this advertiser outcry. "For larger marketers, any one instance of an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm a brand's business value," Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, wrote in an investor note last month that raised concerns about the issue. James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt, argues the ongoing brand boycott is a "power play" to get concessions from the Internet advertising giant. "If there was a window to take back some of that leverage, they took it," Cakmak told CNNTech. But it will be temporary, he adds. "At the end of the day, you can't ignore a platform with over one billion users." Cakmak estimates the financial hit to Google from the boycott could be as much as $500 million -- a significant sum, but a small amount for a company that posted $26 billion in sales last quarter.

Twitter Thanks to Google, we now have the “How do you do, fellow kids” meme in book form. Today the company released an ebook called It’s Lit: A Guide to What Teens Think Is Cool (yes, really). The pamphlet is a guide to help brands market to Generation Z (which they define as teens ages 13-17). Google’s Brand Team for Consumer Apps surveyed 1,600 teens and 800 millennials (ages 18-25) to gather data for It’s Lit—though it’s not clear whether study participants knew they were being interviewed about Google by Google. Once you start reading the report, however, it becomes clear that teen slang doesn’t translate well into scientific studies. It doesn’t help that as Google praises Gen Z, it makes fun of those who came before it. “Unlike millennials, this group is ambitious, engaged and feel like they can change the world,” the introduction reads. “For Generation Z, what’s cool is also a representation of their values, their expectations of themselves, their peers and the brands they hold in the highest regard.” Google estimates that about 60 million Americans are members of Generation Z, and that every one of them is interested in “being cool.” “The activities they think are cool represent their generational power struggle between technology and RL (real life),” the It’s Lit team writes. And since this is a Google survey, what teens really think is cool is …Google. For example, the study states that 44 percent of Gen Z boys and 40 percent of Gen Z girls use Google Plus. That puts the social network behind Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, but ahead of Twitter. Something seems off here… Google Since Google all but forces users of its other products to join Google Plus, however, the statistic provided by the company is quite misleading—an independent study found that less than one percent of Google’s 2.2 billion users (of any age)actively use the social network. Google also engages in some good-natured ribbing of its social media competitors, stating that “Facebook is still a daily habit for most teens for consumption and stalking, but they rarely post and it’s not seen as cool.” The search engine is also the third coolest Gen Z brand, according to study data (only Netflix and Google’s own YouTube surpass it). As such, those three companies are alone in the top quadrant of the study’s “brand coolness” graph. (The most uncool brands include Vice and Uniqlo.) Cool. Google In fact, the final pages of the brochure effectively consist of native advertising for Google. There’s even a word association game where teens refer to it as a “fun, functional, fast search engine.” Pretty bit of branding. Google Google further cements its “coolness” through its self-driving car program and Google Doodles, according to teens surveyed. “Google is really cool because it is an innovator,” a survey participant identified only as a 17-year-old girl from suburban Florida writes. “Google is not only a powerful search engine, but great at everything it does, from email to documents. Google products are easy to use and work well.” Aside from effusively praising Mountain View, the study also reveals that Gen Z’s taste in music is remarkably fluid—teens love The Beatles and Beyoncé, but they also rock out to Twenty One Pilots and Coldplay. The Google researchers also clutched their pearls after learning that teens (gasp!) enjoy both reading and playing video games. Or as the study puts it, “Teens love learning and knowing.” Step aside, Steve Buscemi. There’s a new winner for most uncool statement of all time. It’s lit, fam.

In the run-up to the 2016 election, a Gallup poll revealed Americans' trust in the press had sunk to an all-time low, with just 32 percent surveyed saying they felt "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of trust in the mainstream media. Whether it's criticism from the Trump administration, the failure of the media to correctly forecast the outcome of the 2016 election or the rise of ideological filter bubbles on social media, there's a growing rift between news organizations and the consumers they exist to serve. That's why a coalition of funders, academics, tech leaders, academic institutions, nonprofits and funders, including Facebook, The Knight Foundation, Mozilla and Craigslist Founder Craig Newmark, are banding together to figure out solutions. Earlier today, they announced the News Integrity Initiative, a $14 million project that aims to combat declining trust in the news media and advance news literacy. (Disclosure: The Knight Foundation funds Poynter's coverage of innovation in local news, Newmark funded the creation of a chair in journalism ethics at Poynter and Poynter has partnered with Facebook to create a journalism certificate.) The program is being administered by the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism in New York. Before the program was announced, we caught up with Jeff Jarvis, the director of the Tow-Knight Center, for a conversation about the scope of the initiative and what it would take to restore the public's trust in journalism. Our interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. When I read this announcement, my first reaction was: Facebook seems to be serious about encouraging news literacy. Yes, absolutely. Facebook and the other funders. But I would suggest that this is news literacy and more. And even news literacy should be defined broadly. The problem that I have with the term "news literacy" is it's a little paternalistic. It says, "If you read our news, you're literate. If you don't, you're not." I think the public is so much more involved in the process of news creation and distribution now that we have to rethink it as it's happening. I think we have to make journalists more public-literate, too. So yes, it's about news literacy. But it's also about the informed conversation, which is the way I look at it: How do we do a better job of informing the conversation that exists in a democracy? We saw the need to convene people. Not compete with them, but to help them share best practices and needs and not duplicate. We saw the need to bring others into a conversation that's been pretty much media-centric. So we want to make this a little more public-centric. And we also saw other centers of media that need to be brought in. Last Thursday, we had a small summit here under Chatham House Rules bringing in ad agencies, brands, ad networks, ad technology companies, VR companies, the platforms, publishers and so on. And we made some progress there. Facebook could be accused of being one of the organizations that has contributed to an erosion of the economic model that has supported trustworthy journalism. I don't believe that news organizations were entitled to the revenue that companies like Facebook scooped up. But one could make the argument that this is too little too late now that they've totally trashed the business model for journalism. You're speaking to the other half of my life. This initiative is not specifically focused on business, but the rest of my life at Tow-Knight is focused on business. So I spend most of my time worrying about just that. And what I tell my own colleagues in media is that I don't think Facebook is a media company, or that Google is. I know that's a minority opinion. I think we tend to look at something that looks like what we do and say, "that's us." We risk defining them in our terms and not understanding what they truly are. They're connection machines. They connect people with each other and people with information, and there's a lot of opportunity for us there that we have to understand. What I've been arguing — and I've written this all over creation, over the last two years — what I want to see from the platforms is help in reinventing the relationship and the business model of journalism for the reality that we have now. I think we in journalism can do a lot to teach the platforms about journalism and public responsibility. I think they can do a lot to teach us about resetting our relationship with the public we serve and how we can better inform the public conversation together. Because that conversation isn't happening solely on our site anymore. Its happening all across the net. It's not as if God gave us the revenue that we had. New competitors came along and offered advertisers better deals. But I see the platforms — both of them, Google and Facebook — trying now to help journalistic enterprises. Instant Articles and the new YouTube white label player and so on. I think we see efforts to help the business of journalism. I hope they can help us strategically. It's not about giving money to news organizations. It's about giving strategic wisdom, innovative thinking, data and other capabilities to us to help strategically improve our businesses. That's what I want to put myself at the center of. Can you talk about the way you think about news literacy? You said earlier that this is not the "news literacy initiative," it's the News Integrity Initiative. What's the difference? I went to a great event that Arizona State held a few weeks ago held by my good friend Dan Gillmor. And he's been arguing, eloquently, that we need to think not just about the supply side, but the demand side. And so that's another way to say what I'm trying to say, which is we have to think about the public conversation. And there are good efforts in schools in such around news literacy, and I think those are important efforts to have the mechanisms to make more critical judgements about the veracity of what they read in the world now. But I also think there's a lot more we have to do to regain trust in news. And it goes far beyond saying that the news that we have now is the news we'll always have. It goes to say that we can reinvent what we do — not because we have to — but because we can. We have new opportunities. I want to see us take journalism to people where they are. That means we have to take journalism to conversations as they're occurring on Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and wherever that might be. And that means we've got to get out of our mindset of making destination products. So I guess all I'm trying to say about news literacy is that what I saw at ASU was a broader discussion, thank goodness, than just getting more people to read what we already produce. What I saw at Misinfocon, the week before that, was a broader discussion about reinventing news technology to reinvent what we do. I also hope that we have a discussion that's not just about the bad stuff, it's also about what I hope I see as a flight to quality. You mentioned the idea of bringing journalism to places where conversations are already happening. What would that actually look like? Wherever news and information are, and wherever conversations about society are occurring, that's what we have to worry about. Every year I go to a conference called Vidcon, with my daughter's help. What Vidcon taught me — and I wrote about this at the time — is that media is not a destination. That what we should be making are social tokens that people use in the course of their conversations. When my daughter shares something, she's not doing it because, "this is a good product, you should watch!" She's sharing it because she's saying, "this speaks for me," or, "this speaks to our conversation." It's part of her conversation. We have to start remaking news to be that. So when we talk about news literacy, it's not just about how you use a product called news. It's how we change the service that we have called news to bring it more into conversations and make people's conversations more information-literate. That's a much bigger task, but it's the task at hand. Putting up funding is a great step from Facebook. But I think the big step Facebook could take would be something like adding additional context for news articles or we're going to prioritize quality content over cheap listicles. It seems like the real commitment from these companies would to change their platforms to increase the trustworthiness of the news on it. Yes. But I think the mechanisms, in great measure, are already there. After the Orlando tragedy, the mass murder there, I saw a photo on my Facebook feed of Justin Trudeau kissing a male politician. My journalistic antennae went up. And I said, 'why haven't I seen this before? This seems like the kind of thing he might do, because he's Justin Trudeau making a point. The person who's sharing this wasn't exactly on top of things, so my suspicion was right. My critical faculties came out. I moused over it, debating whether to go over the rat hole and try to figure out where this came from. And boom, as is Facebook's wont — this is now over a year ago — they pop up related content. Related content that popped up was BuzzFeed saying "people are passing around a fake picture of Trudeau and Snopes debunking it." The mechanism is there, I think, to do exactly what you're saying, which is to give people more and better choices at these moments. I think there's a role for media in that, and I think we've got to have the mechanism to alert Facebook, to put metadata on our news to say: "We just reported that thing. And every time that picture comes up, you might want to give people the opportunity to know this and do it in a shorter way." Keep in mind, under the First Amendment, we have a right to lie, too. You can choose to lie. You may be passing around something stupid to mock it. You may share it because it's an indicator of how another side thinks. I want to be very, very careful here that I don't want to put Facebook or Google in the position of being the editor and censor of the world. However, I do agree with you that they can each give higher-quality choices to people. Well, then it's up to us to help them define quality, then. That doesn't mean it eliminates the speech that now can occur. I'm in favor of free speech, and I think that's a good thing. It does, however, say that we can help them with more quality information. I'll give you another example, with Google: If you searched some time ago for "climate change," you got good results. If you searched for "is climate change real?' you got less good results. That's no longer the case. And that indicates to me that Google has chosen to favor the institution of science. I don't know that that's true, and I haven't heard that from them, but I saw an improvement in the quality of those search results. They were less about anticipating the desire of the user and instead about saying that people are asking a question about a topic, and we have to give them a good answer. And so there's a bias in that case toward the institution of science. I think that's a fine thing. But this is at a time in which we have an institutional revolution going on. So, it's a complex question. I think the other thing they could do — John Borthwick and I wrote a piece in the midst of the fake news brouhaha with 15 suggestions of what to do. One of John's big points was that we need the platforms' help as users to track back to the source information, news, rumors and memes. So if you see this link from The Denver Guardian and its only two weeks old, that's an indicator, a signal, that you might want to be suspicious. At the same time, I think we also need to surface media brands more prominently. If you go on Facebook and look at The Guardian, every story they put up has a photo and a blue Guardian bar on it. so you have clearer branding there, and you get to know what the source is. I think the platforms can do a better job of revealing source — in both senses of the word. Have you already explored what some potential projects in this space would be? Can you give me a sample? I'll mention a couple of things that I'm thinking about just as an early way to get going. When we held the event last week with the platforms, publishers and technology folks, we talked about the research that they want. Folks from Microsoft Research were very eloquent about saying that we don't really know what the solutions are yet before we come up with the problems for it. The source, the supply, the distribution and the absorption of news — they argue we need to do some more research on that, which I think is a very good idea. I was at another event not long before that when there was debate about the definition of being informed. How are we going to judge our success or failure? I think there are research projects like that that are foundational to get going. Even before that, however, as my colleague Carrie Brown here at CUNY says — because she's in the PHD and I'm not — there is a lot of research around some of these areas. So the first thing I want to do is to hire somebody to go through the research that exists, find those things that are relevant and translate it into layman's language for the likes of me. So I think there's a foundation of research that I want to get going very quickly. Then, at the event we had last week, there was a fascinating discussion — and I haven't written about this yet — a very tangible discussion to say that there is an opportunity, and a need, to gather, generate and share signals about content and creators across platforms, ad networks, publishers, ad technology companies, and so on. There's no one answer to what's quality and what's not. However, there are signals. Like, "Jeez, The Denver Guardian's only been around for two weeks. You might want to look at this suspiciously." So what we're looking at already is a structure to try to pull together these signals and figure out a way that we can share them so that platforms and ad networks can use their own algorithms, use their own formulae, to weight these signals their own way to determine where they want to put their effort. That, in turn, I think, then, trickles down to the users themselves. Because the more signals we have in this way, the more it can inform ranking decisions on places like Google and Facebook. So, I think that's a project that I want to get going on quickly. We want to do some further convenings internationally. I think the days of the fake news conference, of 'woe is us,' is over. Now we have to go onto solutions. So you might try to create a cross-platform metric for newsworthiness? I want to be careful here. Not a metric. I think there's no god metric of trust. (But there are indicators.) So for example, does this publication adhere to an editorial policy? Does this publication do fact-checking? (Sally Lehrman, director of the Trust Project) has eight things that she's trying to build. So those are signals that you could give to ad networks, platforms and so on. That's one set of signals. Add to that things that the platforms know: How old is this site? That's a signal. Add to it signals about being a trusted media brand. What I'm suggesting here is that there are a lot of signals you can use. And then, an ad network can come along with a given client and say, "we're going to weight that one signal less, and that signal more" — that's up to them. The question is, can we provide these signals to them? And can those who have data already — ad networks, platforms and such — share data? Can we become a middleman here to enable the sharing of that data? Can we make everybody who is pointing dollars and traffic to sites smarter about what they do? I don't know the answer to this. It's something we want to start exploring. What to read next AUTHOR INFORMATION Benjamin Mullin Benjamin Mullin is the managing editor of Poynter.org.

Huawei Mate 9 review: A giant phone with a small frame and big ambitions 2016 in review: The year in Android Video Is Alexa as good on your phone? As part of the April security update, Pixel and Nexus phone users are getting a surprise. Google is rolling out the 7.1.2 Nougat update as part of the bundle, and while most people won’t notice much of a chance, Pixel C users are in store for a big change. While it was long thought that Google had abandoned its Pixel tablet, 7.1.2 brings the Pixel phone’s launcher and navigation buttons to the tablet screen. That means Pixel C users will now access their apps by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, and the search widget will now be a pill-shaped “G” logo pinned to the left side of the home screen. Furthermore, folders adopt the Pixel phone’s way of displaying icons, instead of the previous carousel-style stacking. There’s also some new on-screen navigation buttons. Instead of the outlined triangle and square, they’re now filled in to match the ones on the Pixel. However, since Google Assistant hasn’t yet made its way to tablets, you won’t find a telltale ring around the home button. But where 7.1.2 really departs from 7.1.1 is with the multitasking interface. Gone is the traditional stacked cards interface that occupied the center of the screen, and in its place is a 4x4 grid of your eight most recently used apps. To select one, just tap the image of the screen to bring it full-screen, or you can also drag one of the items to one to the side of the screen to activate the multi-window interface. Once an app is pinned, the remaining screens will resize to fit alongside it and you can select a second one. As far as phones go, there are a series of minor tweaks and bug fixes, though the Nexus 5X will be getting swipe gestures for the fingerprint sensor, and there’s a new alert for apps that are using too much battery. The update has already started rolling out to Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, and Nexus Player devices, but you find the factory images here. C change: All of a sudden, Android tablets are relevant again. First Samsung released the Galaxy Tab S3 and Google is showing some actual attention to the Pixel C.

Image: Sean Gallup/Getty Images By Patrick Kulp2017-04-03 20:18:14 UTC Google has an answer for all the brands worried that its automated systems are placing ads on offensive YouTube videos: smarter machines. The search giant said Monday that it's made progress towards implementing the artificial intelligence safeguards it promised advertisers last month. The company's scrambling in the wake of a worldwide advertiser revolt in which more than 250 marketers pulled spending from the site over ads placed near videos promoting terrorists, Nazi groups and other extremists. SEE ALSO: It only took us five minutes to find a big brand advertising on a hate group's YouTube The company's slate of proposed fixes — machine learning to recognize unsavory videos, a more robust ad-vetting staff, stricter policies — didn't do much to stem the exodus when Google announced them last month. Now, Google's offering a bit more detail. A company spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the system will also incorporate input from third-party measurement and brand safety firms like Integral Ad Science and ComScore. "We are working with companies that are [Media Rating Council]-accredited for ad verification on this initiative and will begin integrating these technologies shortly," the statement said. That could be an important concession for advertisers, who've long been concerned that the "walled garden" nature of dominant digital platforms allows them to offer numbers and claims with no independent verification. Reporting in Business Insider a couple weeks ago suggested that advertisers might use the YouTube debacle as leverage on other tense issues with Google, such as transparency into its measurement processes. Google's business chief, Philipp Schindler, told Bloomberg over the weekend that the solution will involve the "new generation of our latest and greatest machine-learning models."  Between progress made so far on implementing those tools and tighter content rules, the company said it's flagged five times as many objectionable videos in recent weeks than it had before.  The company also claims that some major advertisers are coming back around. Schindler told Bloomberg that Johnson & Johnson, one of the largest companies to pull ads, had already started spending again in most major markets. The most recent wave in the boycott came last week when a host of Australian brands joined their American and British counterparts.

In a report released on Monday, the website said Android accounted for a larger percentage of overall internet usage than Microsoft’s Windows for the first time ever in the month of March. According to the report, the mobile operating system owned by Google recorded an impressive market share of 37.93 percent ahead of Windows owned by Microsoft, which clocked 37.91 percent. Not much of a gap actually, but significant enough considering the long years of dominance of Windows over other OS in the industry. Stats behind the report: StatCounter aggregated data collected from a sample exceeding 15 billion page views per month [and] more than three million websites.” The graph below shows how Android gradually made its way to the top: StatCounter’s CEO, Aodhan Cullen said of the achievement recorded by Android: “It marks the end of Microsoft’s leadership worldwide of the OS market which it has held since the 1980s.  It also represents a major breakthrough for Android which held just 2.4% of global internet usage share only five years ago.” For an operating system that held a paltry 2.4 percent of the global internet usage five years ago, Android’s climb to the top can best be described as remarkable. Against all odds, the operating system has overcome every hurdle to become the world’s most used by internet users. What’s the secret behind the significant rise of Android? The growth is linked with the world’s preference for accessing the internet via smartphones, which contrasts with the decline in sales of traditional PCs. As expected, Windows remains the most used OS when it comes to the desktop market with 84% internet usage share in March, according to the report. “Windows won the desktop war but the battlefield moved on,” said Cullen. “It will be difficult for Microsoft to make inroads in mobile but the next paradigm shift might give it the opportunity to regain dominance. That could be in Augmented Reality, AI, Voice or Continuum (a product that aims to replace a desktop and smartphone with a single Microsoft powered phone).” Android has Asia to thank for its recent achievement. According to StatCounter, the operating system recorded a 52.2% compared to 29.2% for Windows. The story, is however, different in Europe where Windows (51.7%) is more than twice the level of Android (23.6%), and North America 39.5%. Is this the end of an era for Microsoft’s Windows? Is there a way back for an OS that dominated other operating system for so many years [since 1980]? Is Android’s new found strength sustainable? These are questions begging for answers; but the next couple of months or maybe years could provide us with the right answers. Got something to add to this story?

INTRODUCTION Deep learning is a novel machine learning technique that can be used to generate relevant insights from large volumes of data. The term Deep Learning was coined in 2006 by Geoffrey Hinton to refer to algorithms that enable computers to analyze objects and text in videos and images. Fundamentally, deep learning algorithms are designed to analyze and use large volumes of data to improve the capabilities of machines. Companies, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, IBM and Netflix, are already using deep learning algorithms to analyze users' activities and make customized suggestions and recommendations based on individual preferences. Today, in many ways, deep learning algorithms have enabled computers to see, read and write. In light of recent advances, the error rate associated with machines being able to analyze and interpret medical images has come down to 6%, which, some research groups claim, is even better than humans. Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p04805990/Deep-Learning-in-Drug-Discovery-and-Diagnostics-2035.html The applications of the technology are being explored across a variety of areas. Specifically in healthcare, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Precision Medicine Initiative of 2015 have widely endorsed the value of medical data in healthcare. Owing to several such initiatives, medical big data is expected to grow approximately 50-fold to reach 25,000 petabytes by 2020. Since 80% of this is unstructured, it is difficult to generate valuable / meaningful insights using conventional data mining techniques. In such cases, deep learning has emerged as a novel solution. Lead identification and optimization in drug discovery, support in patient recruitment for clinical trials, medical image analysis, biomarker identification, drug efficacy analysis, drug adherence evaluation, sequencing data analysis, virtual screening, molecule profiling, metabolomic data analysis, EMR analysis and medical device data evaluation are examples of applications where deep learning based solutions are being explored. The likely benefits associated with the use of deep learning based solutions in the above mentioned areas is estimated to be worth multi billion dollars. There are well-known references where deep learning models have accelerated the drug discovery process and provided solutions to precision medicine. With potential applications in drug repurposing and preclinical research, deep learning in drug discovery is likely to have great opportunity. In diagnostics, an increase in the speed of diagnosis is likely to have a profound impact in regions with large patient to physician ratios. The implementation of such solutions is anticipated to increase the efficiency of physicians providing a certain amount of relief to the overly-burdened global healthcare system.

A majority of these companies (61%) were founded post 2010. In fact, between 2013 and 2016 alone, the industry saw the emergence of 50 startups in this field. 2. More than 55% of the companies working in this space are applying their deep learning models for diagnostic purposes. Of these, 78% of the companies offer solutions for medical imaging analysis. Notable examples include (in alphabetical order) Arterys, AvalonAI, Bay Labs, Behold.ai, Butterfly Network, CAMELOT biomedical systems, Cyrcadia Health, Enlitic, iCarbonX, Lunit and Zebra Medical Vision. 3. On the other hand, close to 35% of the companies engaged in this domain are focused on applying deep learning models in drug discovery. 57% of these companies provide deep learning powered drug discovery platforms. Examples of players in this segment include (in alphabetical order) Atomwise, Benevolent.ai, BERG Health, Cloud Pharmaceuticals, Cyclica, Hummingbird Bioscience, InSilico Medicine, Mind the Byte, Molplex Pharmaceutical, nference, Numedii, Numerate, Standigm, twoXAR, Verge Genomics, Vium and SparkBeyond. 4. In addition, there are companies that are focused in applying deep learning in both drug discovery as well as diagnostics. Examples of such companies include (in alphabetical order) 23andMe, Appistry, Deep Genomics, Desktop Genetics, Globavir Biosciences, Google, IBM, SolveBio and Wuxi NextCODE. 5. During the last three years, heavy investments have been made in this domain. Of the overall amount invested in last 10 years (USD 1.8 billion), USD 1.6 billion was invested into deep learning initiatives in and after 2014. There are several recent examples. iCarbonX raised USD 214 million in three funding rounds (January 2016, April 2016 and July 2016), Flatiron Health received USD 175 million in Series C funding (January 2016), LAM Therapeutics witnessed funding of USD 40 million (February 2016), and Human Longevity closed a Series B funding round amounting to USD 220 million (April 2016).. 6. In the drug discovery segment, the deep learning solutions have shown to significantly reduce the cost and time spent in bringing a drug to the market. Taking a drug from discovery stage to the market is known to cost up to USD 2.5 billion and takes, on an average, close to 12 years. Deep learning models are likely to save as much as 50% of this cost and save a significant amount of time. By 2035, we have predicted annual cost savings of over USD 100 billion for the global healthcare system. 7. The adoption of deep learning models in diagnostics is also likely to provide several cost and time saving opportunities. According to our estimates, by 2035, deep learning solutions can result in annual savings of over USD 35 billion in the diagnostics segment alone. The activity is likely to be relatively more prominent in the high income countries in the near term. However, in the long term, the low radiologist to patient ratio in middle income countries is likely to provide ample growth opportunities in these countries.

The founding members of PAX include Google, Samsung, LG, Foxconn, HMD Global, HTC, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview. Together, these companies own some 230,000 patents. Google says the patent pool will only grow as more companies join the network. "We believe PAX will further expand the openness of Android for its members, promoting patent peace that will free up time and money for members, who can then dedicate those resources to creating new ideas," said Google. PAX is free for companies to join. Electronics companies often use technology patents as revenue sources, and litigate in order to seek payment. PAX may help reduce patent-based litigation depending on which companies join and what patents are cross-licensed with the group. more info at Google » Related Samsung news   Samsung phones Review: LG G6 more LG news   LG phones HTC news   HTC phones Verizon Bundling Free TV with LG G6 AT&T Launching LG G6 with 2-for-1 Offer T-Mobile to Sell LG G6 Starting April 7 for $650 more Google news Coolpad news   Coolpad phones Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today provided details about its April 2017 security patches for Android devices. The patches plug a significant number of security holes that threaten all Android devices. Google found more than 60 vulnerabilities, of which it classified eight as critical, or able to remotely execute code. Many of the problems are related to specific hardware and the associated software drivers that control them, such as a MediaTek touchscreen driver and a Qualcomm crypto engine driver. Google is pushing two separate patches to cover these vulnerabilities, one dated April 1 and the second dated April 5. As always, Google is pushing the patches directly to its own Nexus- and Pixel-branded devices first. Google has already posted factory images for download directly from its web site. Google's handsets will receive both patches in a single download. Google said that, as far as it is aware, none of these security holes have been exploited for nefarious purposes. Google has already given the patches to its OEM partners. Phone makers are responsible for updating their own hardware with the patches. more info at Google » Related 5 Best Unlocked Smartphones Virtual Reality Comes to the Web Thanks to Chrome Google Distributes First Preview of Android 7.1.2 more Google Pixel news Google Pixel specs & features Google Pixel user reviews Google Pushing Android 7.1.2 to Pixel and Nexus Phones Google Pushes Second Beta of Android 7.1.2 Google Details March Security Update for Android more Google Pixel XL news Google Pixel XL specs & features Google Pixel XL user reviews Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

So far, though, many brands are still playing hard to get. A spokesperson for Google said Monday it will begin working with “trusted” third-party firms to better identify offensive YouTube content that brands may not want to place ads next to. Google also said it is now relying on artificial intelligence to pinpoint content that could be objectionable to advertisers. An investigation published last month by The Times in London revealed that ads from companies like the BBC and L’Oreal were placed near content on YouTube posted by religious extremists, a Ku Klux Klan leader and more. That finding prompted an advertiser exodus in the UK and US. AT&T, Verizon, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase and others all confirmed suspending ads on YouTube. Despite Monday’s announcement, reps for AT&T, Verizon, General Motors and FX Networks told CNNTech there is no reversal yet of their earlier decisions to halt ads. (AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.) Other brands, including Coca Cola, Walmart, Starbucks and Chase, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Only Johnson & Johnson confirmed changing its mind — in select markets. “Johnson & Johnson has resumed YouTube digital advertising in a number of select countries following the implementation of increased brand protection measures by Google,” Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement. The muted brand reaction highlights the challenge Google faces in fully moving past this advertiser outcry. “For larger marketers, any one instance of an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm a brand’s business value,” Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, wrote in an investor note last month that raised concerns about the issue. James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness, Crespi, Hardt, argues the ongoing brand boycott is a “power play” to get concessions from the Internet advertising giant. “If there was a window to take back some of that leverage, they took it,” Cakmak told CNNTech. But it will be temporary, he adds. “At the end of the day, you can’t ignore a platform with over one billion users.” Cakmak estimates the financial hit to Google from the boycott could be as much as $500 million — a significant sum, but a small amount for a company that posted $26 billion in sales last quarter.

In fact, you're more likely to get hit by lightning twice than to get infected.  Of course, that may not seem like it's the case with all the infected apps that get reported after managing to make their way into the Play Store, but it seems to be the actual truth.  "Since 2015, less than 0.00001 percent of installations from Google Play, and less than .01 percent of installations from sources other than Google Play, were categorized as ransomware," reads the report signed by Jason Woloz, senior program manager with the Android security team.  As you know, ransomware is a type of app that restricts people's access to the device until victims pay a sum of money, most often than not in Bitcoin. They're usually present in apps that restrict device access and demand payment, or apps that encrypt data on the external storage of the device and demands payment to decrypt it all.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 April 2017 by Military News Deep Learning in Drug Discovery and Diagnostics, 2017 – 2035 NEW YORK, April 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — INTRODUCTION Deep learning is a novel machine learning technique that can be used to generate relevant insights from large volumes of data. The term Deep Learning was coined in 2006 by Geoffrey Hinton to refer to algorithms that enable computers to analyze objects and text in videos and images. Fundamentally, deep learning algorithms are designed to analyze and use large volumes of data to improve the capabilities of machines. Companies, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, IBM and Netflix, are already using deep learning algorithms to analyze users’ activities and make customized suggestions and recommendations based on individual preferences. Today, in many ways, deep learning algorithms have enabled computers to see, read and write. In light of recent advances, the error rate associated with machines being able to analyze and interpret medical images has come down to 6%, which, some research groups claim, is even better than humans. Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p04805990/Deep-Learning-in-Drug-Discovery-and-Diagnostics-2035.html The applications of the technology are being explored across a variety of areas. Specifically in healthcare, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Precision Medicine Initiative of 2015 have widely endorsed the value of medical data in healthcare. Owing to several such initiatives, medical big data is expected to grow approximately 50-fold to reach 25,000 petabytes by 2020. Since 80% of this is unstructured, it is difficult to generate valuable / meaningful insights using conventional data mining techniques. In such cases, deep learning has emerged as a novel solution. Lead identification and optimization in drug discovery, support in patient recruitment for clinical trials, medical image analysis, biomarker identification, drug efficacy analysis, drug adherence evaluation, sequencing data analysis, virtual screening, molecule profiling, metabolomic data analysis, EMR analysis and medical device data evaluation are examples of applications where deep learning based solutions are being explored. The likely benefits associated with the use of deep learning based solutions in the above mentioned areas is estimated to be worth multi billion dollars. There are well-known references where deep learning models have accelerated the drug discovery process and provided solutions to precision medicine. With potential applications in drug repurposing and preclinical research, deep learning in drug discovery is likely to have great opportunity. In diagnostics, an increase in the speed of diagnosis is likely to have a profound impact in regions with large patient to physician ratios. The implementation of such solutions is anticipated to increase the efficiency of physicians providing a certain amount of relief to the overly-burdened global healthcare system. SCOPE OF THE REPORT The „Deep Learning: Drug Discovery and Diagnostics Market, 2017-2035” report examines the current landscape and future outlook of the growing market of deep learning solutions within the healthcare domain. Primarily driven by the big data revolution, deep learning algorithms have emerged as a novel solution to generate relevant insights from medical data. This continuing shift towards digitalization of healthcare system has been backed by a number of initiatives taken by the government, and has also sparked the interest of several industry / non-industry players. The involvement of global technology companies and their increasing collaborations with research institutes and hospitals are indicative of the research intensity in this field. At the same time, the pharma giants have been highly active in adopting the digital models. Companies such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Novartis continue to evaluate the digital health initiatives across drug discovery, clinical trial management and medical diagnosis. Some notable examples of such digital health initiatives include GSK and Pfizer’s collaboration with Apple for the use of the latter’s research kit in clinical trials, Biogen’s partnership with Fitbit for using smart wearables in clinical trial management, and Teva Pharmaceuticals’ partnership with American Well to use Smart Inhalers for patients with asthma and COPD.

During our research, we identified close to 100 industry / non-industry players that are exploring their proprietary deep learning based technologies in drug discovery and diagnostics. A majority of these companies (61%) were founded post 2010. In fact, between 2013 and 2016 alone, the industry saw the emergence of 50 startups in this field. 2. More than 55% of the companies working in this space are applying their deep learning models for diagnostic purposes. Of these, 78% of the companies offer solutions for medical imaging analysis. Notable examples include (in alphabetical order) Arterys, AvalonAI, Bay Labs, Behold.ai, Butterfly Network, CAMELOT biomedical systems, Cyrcadia Health, Enlitic, iCarbonX, Lunit and Zebra Medical Vision. 3. On the other hand, close to 35% of the companies engaged in this domain are focused on applying deep learning models in drug discovery. 57% of these companies provide deep learning powered drug discovery platforms. Examples of players in this segment include (in alphabetical order) Atomwise, Benevolent.ai, BERG Health, Cloud Pharmaceuticals, Cyclica, Hummingbird Bioscience, InSilico Medicine, Mind the Byte, Molplex Pharmaceutical, nference, Numedii, Numerate, Standigm, twoXAR, Verge Genomics, Vium and SparkBeyond. 4. In addition, there are companies that are focused in applying deep learning in both drug discovery as well as diagnostics. Examples of such companies include (in alphabetical order) 23andMe, Appistry, Deep Genomics, Desktop Genetics, Globavir Biosciences, Google, IBM, SolveBio and Wuxi NextCODE. 5. During the last three years, heavy investments have been made in this domain. Of the overall amount invested in last 10 years (USD 1.8 billion), USD 1.6 billion was invested into deep learning initiatives in and after 2014. There are several recent examples. iCarbonX raised USD 214 million in three funding rounds (January 2016, April 2016 and July 2016), Flatiron Health received USD 175 million in Series C funding (January 2016), LAM Therapeutics witnessed funding of USD 40 million (February 2016), and Human Longevity closed a Series B funding round amounting to USD 220 million (April 2016).. 6. In the drug discovery segment, the deep learning solutions have shown to significantly reduce the cost and time spent in bringing a drug to the market. Taking a drug from discovery stage to the market is known to cost up to USD 2.5 billion and takes, on an average, close to 12 years. Deep learning models are likely to save as much as 50% of this cost and save a significant amount of time. By 2035, we have predicted annual cost savings of over USD 100 billion for the global healthcare system. 7. The adoption of deep learning models in diagnostics is also likely to provide several cost and time saving opportunities. According to our estimates, by 2035, deep learning solutions can result in annual savings of over USD 35 billion in the diagnostics segment alone. The activity is likely to be relatively more prominent in the high income countries in the near term. However, in the long term, the low radiologist to patient ratio in middle income countries is likely to provide ample growth opportunities in these countries.

But they have slowly been transferring functionalities to Google Maps anyway, so this isn’t really a big loss for the company and the users who have contributed to making their neighborhoods, cities, and communities part of the whole digital global map. You were fun while you lasted (and when trolls weren’t taking over), so thank you Map Maker. In their official post, they enumerated the key editing features that were previously in Map Maker but are now available in Google Maps. This includes adding a place, editing info about places, adding more details about the place, moderating edits, viewing the status of your edits, and even editing road segments. They will be adding more features later on until Google Maps becomes fully functional as a Map Maker replacement. One of the reasons why Map Maker became a huge problem for Google is due to poor moderation which led to some politically incorrect and inaccurate edits being added. Hopefully, this time around with Google Maps, they’ve already fixed that problem so that there will be no repeat incidents and that those who are really interested in helping out the community will be able to properly do their “job”, The Local Guides Program is something that you can join if you’re really passionate about helping to add your local knowledge to Google Maps. You will be able to earn points for every contribution, unlock rewards, and even get early access to upcoming new features.

The term Deep Learning was coined in 2006 by Geoffrey Hinton to refer to algorithms that enable computers to analyze objects and text in videos and images. Fundamentally, deep learning algorithms are designed to analyze and use large volumes of data to improve the capabilities of machines. Companies, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, IBM and Netflix, are already using deep learning algorithms to analyze users' activities and make customized suggestions and recommendations based on individual preferences. Today, in many ways, deep learning algorithms have enabled computers to see, read and write. In light of recent advances, the error rate associated with machines being able to analyze and interpret medical images has come down to 6%, which, some research groups claim, is even better than humans. Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p04805990/Deep-Learning-in-Drug-Discovery-and-Diagnostics-2035.html The applications of the technology are being explored across a variety of areas. Specifically in healthcare, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Precision Medicine Initiative of 2015 have widely endorsed the value of medical data in healthcare. Owing to several such initiatives, medical big data is expected to grow approximately 50-fold to reach 25,000 petabytes by 2020. Since 80% of this is unstructured, it is difficult to generate valuable / meaningful insights using conventional data mining techniques. In such cases, deep learning has emerged as a novel solution. Lead identification and optimization in drug discovery, support in patient recruitment for clinical trials, medical image analysis, biomarker identification, drug efficacy analysis, drug adherence evaluation, sequencing data analysis, virtual screening, molecule profiling, metabolomic data analysis, EMR analysis and medical device data evaluation are examples of applications where deep learning based solutions are being explored. The likely benefits associated with the use of deep learning based solutions in the above mentioned areas is estimated to be worth multi billion dollars. There are well-known references where deep learning models have accelerated the drug discovery process and provided solutions to precision medicine. With potential applications in drug repurposing and preclinical research, deep learning in drug discovery is likely to have great opportunity. In diagnostics, an increase in the speed of diagnosis is likely to have a profound impact in regions with large patient to physician ratios. The implementation of such solutions is anticipated to increase the efficiency of physicians providing a certain amount of relief to the overly-burdened global healthcare system. SCOPE OF THE REPORT The "Deep Learning: Drug Discovery and Diagnostics Market, 2017-2035" report examines the current landscape and future outlook of the growing market of deep learning solutions within the healthcare domain. Primarily driven by the big data revolution, deep learning algorithms have emerged as a novel solution to generate relevant insights from medical data. This continuing shift towards digitalization of healthcare system has been backed by a number of initiatives taken by the government, and has also sparked the interest of several industry / non-industry players. The involvement of global technology companies and their increasing collaborations with research institutes and hospitals are indicative of the research intensity in this field. At the same time, the pharma giants have been highly active in adopting the digital models. Companies such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Novartis continue to evaluate the digital health initiatives across drug discovery, clinical trial management and medical diagnosis. Some notable examples of such digital health initiatives include GSK and Pfizer's collaboration with Apple for the use of the latter's research kit in clinical trials, Biogen's partnership with Fitbit for using smart wearables in clinical trial management, and Teva Pharmaceuticals' partnership with American Well to use Smart Inhalers for patients with asthma and COPD. Backed by funding from several Venture Capital firms and strategic investors, deep learning has emerged as one of the most widely explored initiatives within digital healthcare. The current generation of deep learning models are flexible and have the ability to evolve and become more efficient over time.

During our research, we identified close to 100 industry / non-industry players that are exploring their proprietary deep learning based technologies in drug discovery and diagnostics. A majority of these companies (61%) were founded post 2010. In fact, between 2013 and 2016 alone, the industry saw the emergence of 50 startups in this field. 2. More than 55% of the companies working in this space are applying their deep learning models for diagnostic purposes. Of these, 78% of the companies offer solutions for medical imaging analysis. Notable examples include (in alphabetical order) Arterys, AvalonAI, Bay Labs, Behold.ai, Butterfly Network, CAMELOT biomedical systems, Cyrcadia Health, Enlitic, iCarbonX, Lunit and Zebra Medical Vision. 3. On the other hand, close to 35% of the companies engaged in this domain are focused on applying deep learning models in drug discovery. 57% of these companies provide deep learning powered drug discovery platforms. Examples of players in this segment include (in alphabetical order) Atomwise, Benevolent.ai, BERG Health, Cloud Pharmaceuticals, Cyclica, Hummingbird Bioscience, InSilico Medicine, Mind the Byte, Molplex Pharmaceutical, nference, Numedii, Numerate, Standigm, twoXAR, Verge Genomics, Vium and SparkBeyond. 4. In addition, there are companies that are focused in applying deep learning in both drug discovery as well as diagnostics. Examples of such companies include (in alphabetical order) 23andMe, Appistry, Deep Genomics, Desktop Genetics, Globavir Biosciences, Google, IBM, SolveBio and Wuxi NextCODE. 5. During the last three years, heavy investments have been made in this domain. Of the overall amount invested in last 10 years (USD 1.8 billion), USD 1.6 billion was invested into deep learning initiatives in and after 2014. There are several recent examples. iCarbonX raised USD 214 million in three funding rounds (January 2016, April 2016 and July 2016), Flatiron Health received USD 175 million in Series C funding (January 2016), LAM Therapeutics witnessed funding of USD 40 million (February 2016), and Human Longevity closed a Series B funding round amounting to USD 220 million (April 2016).. 6. In the drug discovery segment, the deep learning solutions have shown to significantly reduce the cost and time spent in bringing a drug to the market. Taking a drug from discovery stage to the market is known to cost up to USD 2.5 billion and takes, on an average, close to 12 years. Deep learning models are likely to save as much as 50% of this cost and save a significant amount of time. By 2035, we have predicted annual cost savings of over USD 100 billion for the global healthcare system. 7. The adoption of deep learning models in diagnostics is also likely to provide several cost and time saving opportunities. According to our estimates, by 2035, deep learning solutions can result in annual savings of over USD 35 billion in the diagnostics segment alone. The activity is likely to be relatively more prominent in the high income countries in the near term. However, in the long term, the low radiologist to patient ratio in middle income countries is likely to provide ample growth opportunities in these countries.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Import an iCal or .ICS File to Google Calendar By Justin Pot on April 3rd, 2017 Someone sent you an iCalendar file, but you’re a Google Calendar user. Can you even use this? Yes! People associate the iCalendar format with Apple products, but it’s actually an open standard, and Google Calendar supports it. This means that both iCalendar downloads and iCalendar URLs work well with Google’s online calendar, though the way to add them is somewhat hidden. Here’s a quick explainer, so you can quickly add that file or URL to you Google Calendar. Import an iCalendar File From Your Computer Importing iCalendar files to your Google Calendar is simple, but the functionality is somewhat buried. Head to Google Calendar, then look at the left panel. You’ll see two lists of calendars there: “My calendars” and “Other calendars.” To import an iCal file, you need to click the arrow button next to “Other calendars,” then click the “Import” option. A window will pop up asking which file you’d like to import, and which calendar you’d like to add the file’s appointments to. If you want the events added to their own calendar, create a new calendar before importing. Once everything is set up, click “Import” and Google Calendar will import everything from the file. You should see the changes immediately. As you can see, I now know about my important business event meeting conference town—which is good, because I don’t want to forget about that. I’m sure you’ve got equally important and real appointments to keep track. Subscribe to an Online Calendar RELATED ARTICLE How to Find and Subscribe to Calendars for Just About Anything with iCalShare The iCalendar format isn’t just for offline files: it’s also commonly used to share web-based calendars, generally using a URL starting with webcal://. These web-based calendars are nice because they automatically update, but if you found an iCalendar URL, you might not know what to do with it. You can find and subscribe to hundreds of calendars at iCalShare.com, and for this example we’ll be subscribing to webcal://americanhistorycalendar.com/eventscalendar?format=ical&viewid=4, which highlights events in American history. In Google Calendar, click the down arrow button beside the “Other calendars” section in the left side. The option you’re looking for is “Import calendar.” Click this and you’ll see a pop-up, in which you can paste any iCalendar URL. Click the “Add Calendar” button, and you’re done! Your new calendar will show up in the list under “Other Calendars,” and events should show up right away. If the calendar doesn’t show up, check to make sure the calendar is still actively updated, or that you’ve used the correct URL. Add Cool Calendars to Google Calendar Without Finding Files Don’t want to bother finding iCalendar links? Google offers a decent number of calendars inside Google Calendar itself, and they’re easy to find. Click the arrow button beside “Other Calendars” again, and this time head to “Browse Interesting Calendars.” RELATED ARTICLE How to Subscribe to Your Favorite Sports Teams’ Schedules in Google Calendar You can use this feature to subscribe to your favorite sports teams, and even get the scores the day after games. You’ll also find calendars for holidays in countries around the world, and sunrise and sunset times for whatever town you live in. There’s a lot to explore, so dive in.

The move come as the internet colossus scrambles to derail an advertising boycott of Google's money-making engine. Google said it was using new machine-learning or artificial intelligence systems to enforce its policies, to help content objectionable to advertisers. These systems will be adapted to advertiser preferences, Google said. The tech giant also said it would work with third parties to help advertisers protect their brands from unwanted placement. "As part of our commitment to provide even more transparency and visibility to our advertising partners, we'll be working with trusted vendors to provide third-party brand safety reporting on YouTube," a Google spokesperson said on Monday. Google chief business officer Phillip Schindler recently apologized and said the company was taking a "tougher stance" on hateful, offensive, or derogatory content while ramping up safeguards to make sure ads only appear with acceptable material from legitimate creators. Google has continued to downplay the effect of the boycott. California-based Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw ads fearing placement alongside extremist content, has introduced new tools to give firms greater control. The boycott began in February after the Times newspaper of London found BBC programs were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from Britain for inciting hatred. The analysis found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google had failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the European Union after it anonymously signaled their presence. The British government subsequently put its YouTube advertising on hold, saying in a statement, "it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content." Others to pull the plug included the BBC, The Guardian newspaper group, McDonalds UK and the British arm of the major advertising agency Havas. The movement spread to the United States, with AT&T and Verizon pulling ads from Google. A solution may not be easy. Google needs to strike a balance between pleasing advertisers and those who upload videos to YouTube and are free to take their creations elsewhere if unsatisfied with their shares of ad revenue.

Share Stacy Conradt filed under: Big Questions, Cars, technology, traffic image credit: Google Maps Like us on Facebook Before you leave the house in the morning, a quick glance at Google Maps can tell you which routes should be avoided at all costs and which ones might get you to work a few minutes early. Google Maps can even tell you how long you can expect to be delayed should you take a route that’s more congested than usual. How can it possibly know up-to-the-minute information about your day-to-day travel plans? The answer is one part creepy, one part cool: Google gets its information from you, according to Business Insider. The company uses the Location Services function on Apple and Android phones to track your coordinates. If you have the Location Services capability enabled for Google Maps, you're constantly sending real-time data about your whereabouts and the time it takes you to get from place to place. Google combines everyone’s data to determine the concentration of cars on the roads and how fast they are moving. (Or aren’t moving, depending on your situation.) Over time, Google has compiled all of this traffic information to create traffic histories, which is how it can tell you if traffic is running slower or faster than “normal.” It also uses information gleaned from the Waze app, which includes updates from Departments of Transportation from across the country—that’s why Google Maps can pinpoint specific accidents. If this is all a bit too Big Brother for your liking, you can simply disable Location Services on your phone—but you'd better hope that everyone else doesn't follow suit, or else Google's impressive calculations would be rendered completely useless.

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! It’s the prefix of the season—super. Add it to any word you can think of. And Nitesh Kripalani, country head of Amazon Prime Video, applies it with the felicity of any youthful startup chief executive out there: the customer segment for online video is ‘super-small’ in India. But Amazon’s local customers are ‘super-interested’ in video. Data charges are ‘super-important’ for them. So Amazon, he says, is making sure data consumption for video is ‘superlow’ while ensuring visual quality is ‘super-high’. It’s hard to miss when Kripalani, in his late 30s, can go super six times in a five-minute span. But what’s behind etailer Amazon’s interest in online video—that too, a paid-subscription service— when its old nemesis Google’s YouTube pretty much built the advertising-supported market in India click by click? The answer calls for a perspective of over-the-top (OTT) video on connected devices (laptop, smartphones, tablets, and smart televisions) in the past 15 months, against the incumbent cable and satellite television (TV) market in India. The latter was a formidable Rs 47,500-crore market in fiscal year 2015, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). In contrast, OTT video is less than 20% of the Rs 7,300-crore digital advertising spends in 2016 (an estimate by advertising media company GroupM). Yet, this segment with few revenue shoots is seen as the next big thing in a market ruled by prepaid mobile customers. The Indian Viewer Internet-video services like Hotstar, Netflix or Amazon Prime are called ‘over-thetop’ because they don’t ride on traditional broadcasting or single-telecom networks. Thanks to net neutrality, OTT video doesn’t require any affiliation with any operator. In 2011, the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Amendment Act pushed local cable operators to digitise networks—basically organise the market (see ‘TV Market Gets Organised’). Call this traditional TV, where a single cable or satellite TV subscription is consumed by a household whose industry average is five viewers. Even with a conservative estimate of four persons per household, this is more than 700 million viewers. In comparison, OTT video growth has been tangential to traditional TV market, thanks to price competition among smartphone brands, as well as between telecom operators after Reliance Jio’s largesse to unveil 4G networks. In 15 months, the online segment for video rose from 66 million unique users in 2015 to more than 80 million in end 2016. It’s not the 21% growth that is exciting broadcasting networks (Star Networks, Tata Sky), content owners (Yash Raj Films, Balaji Telefilms) and telcos (Vodafone, Airtel) to push for OTT. It is the behavioural or habit shift that caught their eye. “When distribution becomes free because of the internet to directly access consumers, then competition keeps the market honest,” says a digital media entrepreneur. “The distribution (cable) guy is not king—consumer is actually king.” “In absolute terms, the 80-million number is significant,” says Vidya S Nath, director, digital media, Frost & Sullivan, adding that it is the population of European nations like France or Germany, where traditional cable networks are under threat. “We have got to this scale without adequate broadband infrastructure support,” she adds. The icing on the cake: “These are unique viewers, each of whom is present on one or more platforms.” Services led by data analytics of unique viewer habits make for more sharply-targeted advertisements – the raison d’etre of Google or even Hotstar, the OTT brand of Star Networks which has more than 70 million mobile-device installations. Of the 80 million online viewers in India, the paid-subscriber base was at a minuscule 2 million last year. There is a 40% drop expected after promotional offers expire on services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Currently, Frost & Sullivan pegs industry revenue from paid subscriptions at $8.5 million. That’s why it raises the intriguing question: What’s Amazon Prime thinking by bringing video as a paid-service when everybody else is fighting for the ad rupee? A digital-media industry source, who has worked with content owners and telecom operators for more than a decade, notes this has to do with Amazon’s global strategy of high engagement on its platform. Just like in the US, Amazon is giving a lot more value for Prime than just providing video. “Video is clubbed with instant e-commerce delivery (for Rs 499 per year). You don’t pay extra for faster deliveries,” he says. Further, video helps Amazon because consumers keep returning to the platform, even when they are not shopping online for products. “For Amazon, investing in Prime Video is like investing in customer retention.” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos no less spelt it out in the 2015 shareholder letter, justifying large spends on creating original video content a la Netflix. “(Video) shows are great for customers and they feed the Prime flywheel – members who watch Prime Video are more likely to convert from free trial to a paid membership and to renew annual subscriptions. … Prime has become an all-you-caneat, physical-digital hybrid that members love.” Amazon’s video play, which is less than four months old, cannot be seen in isolation of its overall digital ambitions, even in India. Hunger Games The first users of internet in the US were for paid-utilities like shopping (eBay, Amazon) and internet-enabled home services, apart from email. But in India’s next wave of growth, online users will consume video before buying products online. That’s the bet. “The top three app growth categories in India are music, media and entertainment,” says Pratik Poddar, vice-president at Nexus Venture Partners, a venture-capital (VC) firm in Mumbai. “People are hungry for content and we are seeing significant behaviour change where many users are spending more than 15 minutes a day on new content destination companies.” If Amazon can ensure customer stickiness after getting new users from its OTT service, it can enhance their ecommerce business in the next wave of growth. For this, Prime Video has tied up with mobile operator Vodafone (and is exploring other such partnerships) to tap into new prepaid mobile customers. Until then, Amazon is focusing on increasing customer engagement on Prime, and converting Amazon.in in users to Prime subscribers. Google and Facebook have done this naturally beyond core search and social network businesses, respectively. Until 2015-end, a lion’s share of the OTT market belonged to YouTube, part of the Google arsenal. And WhatsApp, a Facebook company, is emerging as a dominant channel for videos to go viral apart from the parent company’s video ambitions. “Customers here are watching digital content for free, either via an advertising-supported video service, or because pirated video services are still high,” Kripalani explains. “But Amazon customers are super-interested in video. They are engaging with the service, our content selection, which is making Prime a high-growth product. It is reflecting in our consumption and sign-up figures.” In the US, the $136-billion online retail giant has added Reading (Kindle-based), Twitch (gaming), Audible Channels (audio content), and Photo Family Vault as new Primeexclusive digital benefits last year. Stratecherry, a subscription-based newsletter featuring analysis of tech and media news, quoted a Consumer Intelligent Research Partners estimate in March 2016 that Amazon has 54 million Prime members, “which at $99/member would generate $5.3 billion in revenue” globally. Like in India, Prime Video is available at no extra cost to Amazon Prime members in Belgium, Canada, France, Italy and Spain. The OTT fight between YouTube, Netflix and Amazon has been more than a wake-up call for broadcasters, telecom operators and content creators who are rejigging plans for the OTT consumer. “They have to move,” says Brian Morris, general manager of global media and entertainment services at Tata Communications. “If they want to stay competitive, and provide reach to mobile consumers, OTT is not an option. It is a requirement.” Launched in February 2015, Hotstar has stood out for its timing and heavy investment in marketing the brand whose live sports events usher in masses of users. “The biggest gain in OTT is from Indian Premier League T20 Cricket, which is why Hotstar is what it is,” Nath says. A sports series guarantees mobile-video platforms of 5-10 million users depending on the targeted geography. Content Wins OTT video means customers increase their data consumption, and mobile operators will see average revenue per user go up. Content owners too can choose from a range of platforms. They are in the spotlight. Only Much Louder (OML), which manages shows for comedy and live events for brands like All India Bakchod (AIB), are working with two OTT companies, Hotstar and Amazon Prime. “The marketing heavy-lifting by these guys like what Hotstar is doing for On Air With AIB and what Amazon has been doing with comedy specials (14 stand-up comedy episodes of an hour each) has definitely got us new fans,” says Ajay Nair, director of OML. “With Amazon Prime or Hotstar, I know the subscriber is going to spend time there.” The battle is on for content, as Netflix alone added 600 hours of original programming – apart from licensed TV shows and movies – to its year-old service here. In absolute numbers, online video advertising dominates subscription figures, but that is not sustainable as Vice Media, a digital media company headquartered in New York discovered in North America. (Times Group which publishes The Economic Times has a partnership with Vice.) CEO Shane Smith says advertising cannot be a long-term solution with Google and Facebook having four-fifths of that pie. “We have an entire generation which has not seen advertisement because of ad-blocking, iTunes and Netflix,” he noted. Morris of Tata Communications says the revenue model has not been discovered yet anywhere around the world. On that front, Amazon Prime knows there is no such thing as a free lunch. It is a risky gambit for OTT in India, but smart for its consolidated plans. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Google By William White April 3, 2017 Users of Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL) Google Maps app are starting to grow weary of Ms. Pac-Man’s presence. See Also: Beware Scams in Your Google Alerts Luckily for these users, there is a way to remove Ms. Pac-Man from the Google Maps app. Those that are on an Android device can got into their device settings to remove the update with the character. This is down by going to Settings>Applications>Maps and selecting the “More” option. Once here, the user can chose to uninstall updates. It is important to note that this will have the user uninstalling all updates to Google Maps. This will reduce the app back to the version that was available on the device when it came from the factory. Updating the app again after Ms. Pac-Man is gone is a good idea. Advertisement Owners of a device running Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) iOS may not find it as easy to remove Ms. Pac-man from the Google Maps app. They can’t chose to simply uninstall updates. However, they can go back to a previous version if they have backed up their device to iTunes recently. This is also an option that may not sit well with users of the devices and may seem a bit extreme. This is especially true since the Ms. Pac-Man feature on Google Maps will turn itself off automatically on April 4. Desktop users that are desperate to remove Ms. Pac-Man from Google Maps are out of luck. They will just have to wait until Tuesday to be rid of her, reports Metro. Ms. Pac-Man was added to Google Maps for April Fool’s Day. This isn’t the first time that the company has done something like this. Back in 2015, Google added Pac-Man to the app as its April Fool’s Day surprise. This article is from InvestorPlace, not the Kiplinger editorial staff.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 April 2017 by Military News Microsoft Partner Network Podcast: Learn how to break the mold with disruptive marketing Welcome back to the Microsoft Partner Network Podcast, where we speak with industry leaders and partners about the big ideas shaping business and technology today. Past episodes feature interviews with inspiring speakers such as David Meerman Scott, Jo Burston, Carol Roth, and Tim Hurson, about everything from marketing to management and the future of the Intelligent Cloud. In our latest episode, we sat down with author and Microsoft communications designer Geoff Colon to talk about the evolution of communication and how the discipline of marketing is heading in a new and exciting direction. What is Different About Disruptive Marketing? Geoff’s new book, Disruptive Marketing, is all about throwing tired marketing strategies out the window to make room for more impactful and unexpected ways for businesses to connect with customers. We are entering a new age of creative economy that is pushing boundaries with cloud computing, mobility, and big data. Businesses need to think creatively about how they are going to use the new information and tools available today to get the most from this moment in time. Geoff mentioned in our conversation with him that Microsoft is on the leading edge of embracing a more human approach to marketing. He is passionate about marketers finding the balance between the art and the science, the analytical and the creative. That balance is what will reach out and connect businesses with customers, especially in our age of over-saturated marketing content. How do we make marketing about people again? In our conversation, Geoff noted that some of the best marketers come from backgrounds in the social sciences. That’s because marketing is at heart about understanding people – how they think, how they act, and why they partner with businesses. Marketing is most effective when it is connecting people. It is becoming very clear to marketers that customers suffer from digital overload. They ignore and even resent unwelcome advertising. In person conversations and word of mouth are still the most powerful forms of marketing today. According to Geoff, that’s because humans crave that personal attention, and an overall sense of belonging. “Marketing is about a human connection. We have marketing tools and programs that help us track what works, but at their most basic those tools help us understand how people behave.” -Geoff Colon, author of Disruptive Marketing How do we balance data and creative? Geoff said one of the most impactful things businesses can do today to connect with customers is to balance the data and the creative elements of their marketing. Big data is powerful, but it’s not all-powerful. Businesses need to use data creatively when building their marketing strategy. Here are 4 tips he recommended to help partners do just that: Learn by doing. Disruptive marketing is a lot like riding a bike. You try something and if it doesn’t work, you try something else. Don’t be afraid to fail. In fact, failing fast is one of the best things you can do for your business. Just make note of what led to the failure and pivot accordingly. Take chances. Create your own website, start a podcast, start a twitter account, do something new to get your brand and your message out in front of your customers. Think beyond the utilitarian. Keep the customer journey in mind. Rethink your user experience, ramp up your personalization efforts, and keep in mind that your customers are social animals. They make choices based on the people they want to work with. To hear more from Geoff on the topic of disruptive marketing, tune in to the latest episode of the Microsoft Partner Network Podcast.

Every week, we bring in industry leaders and Microsoft partners to talk about the big ideas shaping business and technology today. In today’s episode, we’re talking with author and Microsoft communications designer, Geoff Colon about marketing strategies, disruptive marketing strategies. Hi, Geoff. Welcome. We’re really excited to have you here. Geoff Colon: Hey, Rachel, thanks for having me. Braunstein: So, tell me a little bit about yourself. Your profile is very vast. I mean, we’re talking influencer strategies, Fortune 500 brand lead designer, there’s too many things. Plu,s you brought me a book, Disruptive Marketing, in this fantastic yellow and green. You have a really broad experience here. How did you get to Microsoft with everything you’ve done? Colon: Yeah, good question, a lot of people ask me. I think, you know, instead of what’s in my background, my attitude in life is probably more important, which is try everything once because what do you have to lose? If you don’t like it, you’ll just go on and find other things that you can enjoy. And I had the opportunity a couple of years ago through a recruiter to come and work at Microsoft and took that same attitude, you know, try everything once and if you don’t like it, I can always go and work somewhere else. I was in New York City at the time working in the agency world and just decided, hey, I’m going to pick up and move 3,000+ miles to the Pacific Northwest and work at the mothership. And almost four years later, I’m still here and I really enjoy working at the company because I think it is one of those companies you write your own job description. You figure out what is necessary and you just sort of go out and do it. I think that is the future of work and so I’ve really enjoyed my time here and how I got here which is basically taking a chance or taking a risk. Braunstein: So, what does that mean with what you’re doing with search advertising and Bing ads? Colon: Yeah, I mean, the thing there is there’s a lot of risk and challenge there. You know, we have a very good robust advertising business here at Microsoft. But we’re not the lead. We are not a legacy brand in that space whatsoever. Google is sort of the big power company in that space. Facebook has a lot of power in that space. But we also have a monstrosity that’s just across the lake from us in Amazon that is creating a large advertising business. So, that means that we have to take a path that is very different from maybe how we’ve built the business in the past 40 years here at Microsoft and other areas and that means a lot of risk, a lot of growth hacking, a lot of trying things to see if it works. And a lot of product development that differentiates ourselves from others. But I think also in the marketing world, how we approach things in a more human manner is how we stick out from our competitors. People like to do business with Microsoft because we have a vision that might be different from other companies. We have an ethical point of view on technology that’s different from other companies. And this is very important in the modern world because this is how people are actually deciding who they want to work with rather than just utilitarian factors of hey, they make the most money. We know that and we’ve all been in this situation before. You can take a job that pays you the most; it’s not necessarily going to be the best experience. I think what we try to do here is really provide a good experience with all of the customers and clients that we work for. We have to do that. We are in a situation where we have to go above and beyond because we don’t necessarily have the largest market share. We don’t have necessarily all of the ad products that the competitors have. But it’s a great place to be. And if you have a mindset, a good mindset of wanting to do more, I think it’s a good environment to be in. Braunstein: So, you talked about taking risk and growth hacking, and the name of your book—Disruptive Marketing, What Growth Hackers, Data Punks, and other hybrid thinkers can teach us about navigating the new normal. Colon: That’s a mouthful. Braunstein: So, what does that mean? Colon: Yeah, you know, what it really means is we live in a world where being more left brain or right brain isn’t going to necessarily help us navigate what’s around us. Now it’s really best to almost approach the world like a hybrid—a little bit of left and right brain. And the interesting thing here is no one is really 100% left brained or 100% right brained. I think there was somewhere where that tall tale or urban legend got out there, but scientifically we use both parts of our brain. Otherwise, we wouldn’t function. But what I am getting at in the book is how do you tap into sides of your thinking that you might not be strong at so you have more balance? And we see this in a variety of different cultures. You have the yin and yang of the world. You always have this—we are always trying to get to this place, I think, where we want balance. That is where we’re at our best. I think that’s the same in marketing. It’s not just so much about doing something but almost living and breathing in a certain way and that comes through balance. And we have a tendency of being too analytical in marketing or too creative. Now we really have the best of both worlds and a lot of that is through technology we can be more analytical and track things. At the same time, if you have something that’s not very creative, it doesn’t matter what you track because it’s still going to be not interesting. So, we want—you know, I really want to people to think more creatively in this new era which is why I titled the book and wrote the book. And this new era really is this creative way. We’ve moved really from the agricultural era to the industrial era to a knowledge era and now we live in this sort of creative era. What do you do with all this information? Just having it doesn’t make us better. We have to creatively use it in ways to make the world a lot more interesting. Braunstein: Where do you even start with that because I would say our partners struggle with marketing; it is a muscle that still needs to be worked out. I mean, building websites, how do you do social media? I get asked this all the time. When do you use social media? How do you do a blog? Where do you start? Forget even being disruptive to just do marketing? Colon: You know, a lot of it I think is how did you learn how to ride a bike? You got on it, you tried to ride it. You probably failed. You probably fell off it several times but then eventually you learned. I think that’s what we have to approach in marketing again. You know, there was a time when it took a lot of technical people to build a website. But now you can do that on your own. So, I actually encourage people—hey, even if you’re not going to do it for work, get a square space account or a Wicks account or something and just learn how to put a website together, code a little bit, figure out how it visually will operate, what it will look like on a mobile phone, how someone will experience that. Open up a Twitter account. Tweet. Make some mistakes. Get some people angry at you. That’s how you learn how to communicate, I think, in the modern era. I don’t have a background in video editing but I learned how to do it because I just said this is something that is going to change how we communicate with each other so I’m going to learn this. I have a podcast that I started in 2012 in my basement back in Maplewood, New Jersey. I had no recording background but there was a garage band and there was a Blue Yeti microphone and I plugged it in and just created a minimum viable product. I think what we have to do now is just take more chances. We are always looking for a templatized version of if you do A you’ll get B and that’s not necessarily the world that we live in. There’s a lot of things that I think partners can do that might be left of center that actually draw them attention. I think the most important thing is how do you differentiate yourself from everybody else out there and what they offer. That’s a big part of marketing even though people don’t think it is because it falls into branding and branding is a form of marketing. And I think we have to think beyond utilitarian factors. Yes, you offer these services but how do you offer them? Do you customize those? Are they personalized? At the end of the day, we’re social animals, Rachel, and I think that’s why people gravitate towards others and why they continue to want to work with people. I mean, you probably experience this yourself; I have in my own career. I don’t take a job because it’s a job. I take a job because you get to work with people you enjoy working with and I think that’s the big thing partners probably understand but also we want them to learn and continue to learn which is how you interact with people is a form of marketing now since the entire economy is really based on communications and word of mouth. Braunstein: Are there any standout examples or anything that could paint a picture? Not even standout example, just what a modern, like a successful modern marketing or whatever we call that. Colon: Yeah, I mean, I think the big thing now is to think about human experience. We have a tendency of thinking about how people will move through a customer journey but that funnel has been obliterated because it’s a linear funnel and it’s not how we behave. I mean, humans are irrational. I think one of the things that’s interesting is the Chicago School of Thought and Economics has really been disrupted by people like Richard Thaler who have come along and said actually economics is behavioral. There is another professor at Yale who said actually, economics is tied back to a narrative. My late father was an economics professor and I always loved how he said oh, that company is not going to do very well, I think. I think the share price will fall. And I would say what are you talking about, Dad? They’re trading at $100 a share. And he would say but people don’t believe in the company. So, at the end of the day, marketing is still a human connection even though we have technology to do all of these things. We have search marketing. We have social media marketing. We have analytics. We have different things we can track. However, all those things are set up so we can actually try to figure out how humans interact with us. So, we can go back to thinking about how people behave and how they behave both irrationally as well as rationally. I think those are the best marketers. I think people who have backgrounds in sociology and human behavior mixed with people who also have technical skills are really what a modern marketer is. Braunstein: It’s funny because what you’re saying is oh, the customer has changed. They’re changed. What you’re saying is they’re humans. Actually, we’re still the same. We’re just doing things a little bit differently. Colon: What’s the old saying, the more things change, the more they stay the same. And also what goes around comes around. I mean, we’re almost going full circle now where because of a digital overload in everything that we do, because we’re on devices 75% of our time now, we love this human connection like you and I have in a studio where we’re sitting next to each other and we’re talking. People enjoy that. I think many of the events that I go to with partners, the best thing is just having a conversation with them. They get to shake your hand. They get to ask you questions. They get to pick your brain. And you show them attention. And that is really something that is human. Humans crave attention. We have a sense of belonging and I think that’s an important part of marketing that we miss when we try to set everything up so that it basically is hey, how are we tracking on ROI or how are we tracking on direct marketing? Those are tactics. At the end of the day, we’re trying to reach people and get them to feel something. Braunstein: Yeah. You talk about people, something I think our partners are very curious about—everybody is. How do you reach millennial audience and now the millennial audience is now the biggest part of the workforce, officially. Yeah, their managers are not millennials. That’s a huge gap. Most likely somebody who’s listening today is going to hire a millennial but doesn’t understand what they’re about. They’re a unique audience. I’m a millennial. What do you say to that? How do you speak? How do you market in some sense to them? Colon: Well, I think the big thing there is what’s your emotional intelligence? Do you have empathy for other people? You know, in the book I use the topic of try to understand what a women in Lagos, Nigeria goes through on a daily basis. That’s very different from what you and I go through living here in the Pacific Northwest. But that builds empathy. We understand what technology they use, what areas that are important for them in terms of what they would like to—what they want to learn. Also, what blockades that they face, what obstruction they face in life. That’s important because when we market now, we have to have context for who people are. And as you said, Rachel, you have to understand who this whole sector of the population is. And I’ve actually found that older millennials are different than younger millennials. So, you have a very large population but the older portion is different from the younger portion and that’s something that people have to understand and I think they pick that up through emotional intelligence and empathy. The best thing though is to actually shadow someone and look at what they do day to day. I mean, one of the best things ever was a couple of years ago, I worked in the agency world in New York City and I would sit in the open air office space that we had and I would watch and observe what people would do who were very young compared to myself. And they always had headphones on. And even if I could go up and talk to them, they would rather have me electronically communicate with them. And they liked texting over email. And there were a number of different things. Even in this day and age, I work with a lot of younger people here at Microsoft, they will ask me, hey, is it okay if I text you? Because I have that bond with them, but they also don’t want my inbox clogged with everything, especially if it’s simple chatter. Hey, are you going to bring this to the event that we have? There’s no need for an email because it’s more real-time communication. So, I think one of the things that we have to understand is how do different portions of the population, depending on where they live in the world geographically as well as their age, how do they communicate? Because how they communicate isn’t wrong, it’s just different. It’s almost like if you go to a doctor’s office, they will still have a fax machine and there is nothing wrong with that because they still have to use faxes to send orders in for pharmaceutical drugs. Yet, when you go and if you went in and talked with them and said, hey, I have the latest social software, they would look at you like you have two heads because you are not able to empathize with their situation, what they have to go through, how they have to communicate. I’m sure they would love to communicate using SMS or Snapchat, but they have to communicate a certain way because they might be in a regulatory industry. And younger people, when we watch or observe how they communicate—and someone just wrote an editorial about this I think for the Washington Post—they said, oh, Snapchat’s ridiculous. Why would anyone want to use it? Of course, this is a 50 year old guy who doesn’t understand that it is a form of communication. You’re not taking videos just to take videos. It is basically the modern equivalent of how we text. You’re showing snippets of what you’re doing because that’s how you communicate. And if we look at how communication has worked and how it have evolved, you can’t look back on ancient civilizations who used fire to communicate or who used wall paintings to communicate and say oh, that’s the most ridiculous thing ever. It was a different place and a different time and that’s where we are right now. And I think the more we can understand people and understand one another, the more civil society will be and the more we’ll be able to actually get things done in our business world which is ultimately what we all want to do. Braunstein: So, empathy. A lot of empathy and understanding. That’s really what marketing is. Colon: Totally. Braunstein: I don’t think enough people understand that. That’s why I love marketing because it’s about the person and if that’s what you love—that’s why I’ve always loved it. Colon: Yeah, I mean, you love people. I think that’s the interesting thing is we’re not marketing to robots although that is in the cards in the future. But we are still trying to reach people and we want to know what motivates them. And I think if you just make everything so that it’s just sort of cold and calculated and 100% analytical, at the end of the day you’re not really going to connect with anyone and then you’re going to wonder why hey, how come our marketing isn’t working? Well, because it isn’t motivated by anything that’s really what drives us as humans. So, I think those are things that we have to think about a little bit more. Braunstein: So, you kind of alluded to marketing to robots. So, the future. What do you think the future of marketing holds? Colon: It is going to be a combination of marketing to robots and marketing to people. And what I mean by that is we are moving into a world now where we have a number of conversation bots taking over the web. We are moving into a whole new world of computing where the app ecosystem, even though it’s strong right now as we speak in 2017, by 2020, that might not be as strong or it will operate very different. It will operate in the sense that let’s say you wake up that morning and you need to go to a flywheel class, and I’m saying that because I enjoy flywheel, and you go to book flywheel. Now you have to go to a site or an app and do all of that through manual labor. You have to put all the information in. A bot will be able to scrape the information that you already have and do that work for you. It will then also put that information into your calendar and it may even give you a verbal sort of notification. Geoffrey, don’t forget, you have a flywheel class at 9:30 in Bellevue. Braunstein: It will sound like that? Colon: Yeah, I’m trying to do my best Cortana voice but I don’t think I did it very well. And then you’ll know, okay, hey, I have to actually go to that. And of course, if you need to cancel, a bot will help you do that. There are a lot of things that are going to change in the next couple of years where the web is based on actions and a bots will actually help us perform those actions. But that changes marketing because you have to market not just to people to take those actions but you have to market so that the bot is programmed to help that person’s experience. And when we talk about experience, and this is a very big part of marketing now, we have to think about what do people do in their day to day and this is where personalization really comes in to the playing field because what you do, Rachel, is very different from what I do. The apps you have different from my apps. The bots that will program your calendar different from the bots that will program my calendar. And, of course, this is only learned through systems if we help it learn by speaking to it or giving it prompts. This is why we have a number of verbal cues with things like Cortana, Siri, Amazon Echo. We’re giving it a prompt no different than how you would put ://start. Now you say Cortana, find a flight for me to New York City on March 11th. So, that is going to change a lot of how we actually operate, but it’s still human. The more human you can make that experience, the better marketer you will be. The more utilitarian and with a sort of technological functionality, the more people will just sort of say yeah, this works, but it’s pretty cold feeling. And that’s why I think it’s very important for marketers to still think about how do you actually reach people in a way where they feel emotionally connected and they feel that they’re part of something bigger. I mean, I think that’s just part of the 21stcentury purpose driven economy, at least in the western world. In other parts of the world, very different, and we know that. And, of course, I have to state that because that is empathy right there. I know that they use different technology in different countries and that what you have to do day to day is very different from how we may act here. But I think ultimately those are things that may envelope the entire world in the next 4 years. Braunstein: So, if you had to give a few key pieces of advice or action to take or resources to use to start disrupting, what would you say, Geoff? Colon: I think the most important thing is how do you use disruptive innovation with creative destruction? And what I mean by this is many of us don’t have a lot of money for marketing. But that shouldn’t prevent us from doing things that are the basics or help connect with others. So, how do you do things that are low cost yet also creative, very different? They grab the attention of the people that you’re actually trying to reach? I think there’s a tendency of people to think that they have to build these elaborate systems in order to market but there’s a variety of tools that we can tap into that exist out there for us. It’s how we use those tools, how we manipulate those tools, how we hack those tools that’s really the most important. So, you know, that goes back to how are you going to use social advertising for your business and not make it look really boring in someone’s news feed? How are you using search marketing for your business so that you’re actually reaching people that are maybe typing that left of center keyword that your competitors aren’t thinking of so you can own that space. How are you thinking about the physical world? We have a tendency of forgetting this, Rachel. The physical world, we still live in it at least a majority of the time. Very different when we put on a VR or an AR headset. But we still live in the physical world and I think we have to remember that marketing takes place in the physical world and I don’t mean by signage. I mean literally by hey, did you hear about this company? Did you hear what this company is doing? Did you hear what this technology is doing? Most things are still word of mouth, hand to hand discussion. So, the thing that I think that people have to think about in order to be truly disruptive is how do you actually persuade and influence people so that they’re talking about you, not all the time, but at those moments in time that are really the most important for you to gain relevance. And I think relevance is the huge barometer or huge indicator that we don’t think about as marketers. We ask questions like if I put X amount of dollars will I get X amount of dollars back? But a lot of the tactics and techniques that I talk about are low cost and they’re done so that you actually stay relevant because relevance is so important in what—in the times we’re living in. We’re living in an attention economy right now and if you don’t have any relevance, ultimately, you’re just not going to have a business and you’re going to fade away. Braunstein: Yeah, that’s awesome. That’s perfect advice, Geoff. Thank you so much for coming in. Colon: Thank you. Braunstein: We really appreciate it. Check out his book. We’ll put it in the descriptions. Thanks, Geoff. Colon: Thanks, Rachel. Braunstein: Thanks for listening today and check out the podcast description for show notes.

Name: Subject: Message: Google introduces PAX, Android patent licensing initiative Newsby Brian Reigh11 hours ago 5 132 6 As technology grows, so do patent wars. Patents are incredibly important, of course, but they can become an obstacle to innovation when abused or overused. Google understands this, and in an effort to further Android’s open nature, is introducing PAX, a patent licensing initiative focusing on patent peace. See also: LG wants BLU phones banned over alleged patent infringement 7 days ago The patent system, as demonstrated by its origin, can lead to dangerous monopolies. While they are designed to help innovators protect their ideas, sometimes, the overuse and misuse of patents halt important progress. Google is looking to alleviate this problem with PAX, a patent licensing platform which focuses on cooperation and sharing instead of legal battles. Currently, PAX is comprised of Google, Samsung, LG, Foxconn, HMD, HTC, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview, boasting over 230,000 patents total. Pax, as you may know, comes from Latin, meaning peace. Fittingly, PAX is designed to bring together those who are involved in the Android ecosystem so that its members can spend their resources on new ideas, not patent lawsuits. Currently, PAX is comprised of Google, Samsung, LG, Foxconn, HMD, HTC, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview, boasting over 230,000 patents total. However, as it becomes more mainstream, Google is optimistic that it’ll attract even more members. Free and open to anyone, PAX is the search giant’s latest effort to bring healthy competition and true innovation. Previous efforts include LOT Network and the Open Patent Non-assertion Pledge. Under the PAX program, Google states that “members grant each other royalty-free patent licenses covering Android and Google Applications on qualified devices.” Android has always been associated with openness, and as a result, not only has it seen a tremendous amount of innovative variations, but it also boasts an astounding 1.6 billion active users, making it the most popular smartphone OS in the world. Google’s latest attempt at expanding its openness and bringing patent peace will undoubtedly grant manufacturers even more freedom to innovate.

The group, which also includes Samsung, LG, and HTC, have agreed to share patents covering “Android and Google Applications” on any device that meets Android’s compatibility requirements. The patents will be shared for free, and the group is supposed to be free and open for any company to join. The agreement’s proper name is the “Android Networked Cross-License,” but the group is calling it PAX for short. “Pax” means “peace” in Latin, and Google says the agreement is about reaching a legal peace within the tech world. “Patent peace often coincides with innovation.” “In the world of intellectual property, patent peace often coincides with innovation and healthy competition that benefit consumers,” writes Jamie Rosenberg, an Android business VP with Google. “It is with a hope for such benefits that we are announcing our newest patent licensing initiative focusing on patent peace, which we call PAX.” It’s not entirely clear what types of patents will be shared through this agreement, or what threats these companies hope to defend against. But generally speaking, the agreement ought to help participants defend against patent trolls — companies that own patents make nothing, and only bring in money through lawsuits — and potentially even other large tech companies should they get into a standoff over intellectual property. The PAX group writes that they believe signing up “materially reduces patent risk.” We’ve reached out to Google for more information on what the agreement covers. The agreement could be a big win for Samsung and Google. Samsung makes and sells more Android devices than any other company on the list, and this pact makes it a harder target for patent trolls to hit. For Google, this agreement also helps to open the Android ecosystem up to smaller companies that may be interested in making a device but fear litigation. While this agreement should help to defend Android manufacturers against some lawsuits on its own, its scope is fairly specific and seems to be limited to software. This isn’t the only licensing agreement of its kind, though. Google previously started a group that pledges to only use patents defensively, while another group it co-founded, the LOT Network, prevented companies from buying up patents just to sue others.

Published on April 03, 2017. Most Popular In a wide-ranging discussion at the 4A's Transformation conference this morning, Michael Roth, Interpublic Group of Cos. Chairman-CEO, discussed industry hot buttons such as brand safety on YouTube, transparency and measurement issues on digital platorms and the incursion of consulting companies on agencies' turf. Michael Roth Credit: Courtesy IPG Mr. Roth, who talked about IPG's "open architecture" structure, which gives clients access to all disciplines across its network, said he thinks consulting firms, like Accenture, are trying to get into advertising "because their own business isn't doing particularly well." He added that while they are already working with the C-suite, the consulting firms aren't going to come up with iconic creative campaigns. "You need special individuals on the creative side, and frankly, I don't see those individuals working at an Accenture," he said. To counter the Accentures and IBMs of the world, IPG is digging into what it calls a "business transformation model," with R/GA and Huge already working with clients on this front. "We're bringing more to the table and we can execute on business transformation," he said. On the subject of brand safety, Mr. Roth said advertisers are "appropriately concerned" about ads being placed next to unsafe content on YouTube and Google. "The key to communicating with consumers as a brand is to have a high standard of brand reputation, and if your communication is being associated with something offensive, that is not the way to build brand loyalty," said Mr. Roth. Some IPG clients, such as Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson, have joined other large marketers in halting their ad spending with YouTube until the issue is resolved. Though there are reports that some advertisers are returning. Unlike rival WPP CEO Martin Sorrell, who said the boycott doesn't make sense, or Havas, which nearly implemented an agency-wide boycott, Mr. Roth said IPG is allowing each client to make its own decision. He said IPG is working closely with its clients and Google on third-party verification and believes progress is being made and Google "will solve this as best as they can." Related Stories Google Admits Brand Safety Is a Global Problem There Are Fewer Than 100 Black Women Execs in Adland As for Facebook, which faced its own transparency issues as of late, Mr. Roth said the platform has used third-party verification under the recommendation of IPG and the next step is to verify Facebook's data to "make sure dollars are being spent where they should be." "Clients spend a lot of money, and to the extent that they spend that money, they want to make sure the return on investment is proper and make sure they're reaching consumers," said Mr. Roth. Snapchat is a platform where IPG may not tell clients to be "all in," but still believes they should be advertising there, said Mr. Roth, adding that IPG is working with Snap to develop metrics and make sure clients are getting the ROI they expect. (He also said that he personally does not use it, drawing laughter from the audience.) Similarly, he said Twitter has some work to do in terms of measurement and metrics. With the upfronts and newfronts coming soon, Mr. Roth said TV is likely to use the recent Google fiasco to pitch linear television. However, according to IPG's soon-to-be-released Magna forecast, Mr. Roth said linear TV is pretty flat, while digital is up 10% to 14%. IPG, though, is "agnostic" when it comes to where dollars go, according to Mr. Roth, because the holding company doesn't have "any economic interest in the inventory." Mr. Roth ended the discussion by talking about another pressing topic in the industry: gender and diversity. He said the lack of female leadership is "embarrassing" in the industry, but IPG is making strides, with females making up 40% of its board and 54% of its managers. But even with this progress, he said only 1% of the female leaders in the industry are black, which is "insane" given the marketplace, consumers and clients today. That is why IPG has recently launched a major effort for black women in advertising, he said.

With Google Wifi, you can now schedule an internet pause time during which the Wi-Fi is blocked from certain devices. The company suggests using it during dinner, your kids’ homework time, or bedtime. You can set multiple timers, tailor how often those pauses repeat (like only on school nights), and then choose the affected devices. You can even pause your gadgets for some extra device sanity when trying to go to sleep.

The search giant came under fire recently when top brands claimed ads were appearing on YouTube propaganda vids. Understandably not wanting to fund extremism, even inadvertently, several of the companies pulled their ads. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Google is now ramping up the power of its AI to combat this. According to Bloomberg, the company is now using an upgraded form of machine learning to flag five times as much objectionable content as usual in the last two weeks. YouTube’s vast video library makes it difficult to catch everything, at least for humans. It’s inevitable that some of the work will be delegated to AI algorithms. Google’s Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler, told Bloomberg that human eyes contributed to the flagging, but that they couldn’t do everything. “The problem cannot be solved by humans and it shouldn’t be solved by humans.” Google Updates Ads Policies Again, Ramps Up AI to Curtail YouTube Crisis on Bloomberg Read next: New immigration policy could preclude computer programmers from securing a visa DistractGoogle Share on Facebook (98) Share on Twitter (220) Rachel Kaser is a reporter from Texas.

Read the recap of our "Women in Social Media" conversation. Explore more:  security online security data security website strategy Why Every Website Owner Should Care About (and Convert to) HTTPS April 02, 2017 Donna Duncan Most people know, or at least suspect, that it’s unwise to purchase items over a public Internet connection - but they might not know why. One of the reasons is because of a possible 'man-in-the-middle' attack - a MITM attack is when someone inserts him or herself into the middle of your, and the website you are visiting’s, Internet connection and impersonates both parties in order to gain access to sensitive information like userIDs, passwords, name, address, telephone number, and credit card data. Let’s say, for example, Ann (A) is in her favorite coffee shop browsing Best Buy (B’s) eCommerce website and wants to make a purchase. There's nothing to stop a malicious man-in-the-middle (M) from inserting himself into Ann and Best Buy’s conversation. He can capture, and possibly alter, the data that gets transmitted. If Ann makes a purchase, he can adjust the order quantity and/or steal her identity. Ann and the website she’s visiting are both at risk. HTTPS Protects In-Transit Data Enter HTTPS. HTTP (without the “s”) stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is the standard and agreed-upon format for transmitting data between two devices on the Internet. Just like the default language of aviation is English, the default language of computers is HTTP. HTTPS, on the other hand, stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It's a way to help protect conversations between two computers by layering a security certificate and encryption on top. Here’s how it works. Let’s revisit Ann’s shopping experience and pretend she's shopping at Adorama (D) instead of Best Buy. Adorama has a secure (HTTPS) website. When Ann uses her browser to connect with Adorama: Her browser requests and Adorama sends, an independently verified security transaction that certifies the web server Ann is trying to connect to does, in fact, belong to Adorama. Adorama also sends an encryption key to Ann’s browser. The key will be used to encrypt or scramble any subsequent transactions between the two. Only Adorama has the decryption key - even if a malicious man-in-the-middle intercepts their exchange, he or she will not be able to alter, delete, or make any sense of subsequent conversations. Both parties are protected. HTTPS is added security but not total protection - already some folks are figuring out ways around the certification process. It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction, and it's likely to improve even more as time goes on. Why Convert Now? HTTPS has been around since 1994 - so why is there a sudden push for everyone to convert? What changed? Concerned that users are not recognizing or heeding Google’s previously neutral and ambiguous labeling of unsecure websites, on September 8, 2016 Google announced that beginning in January 2017, it will explicitly start labeling all HTTP connections as not secure. “Historically, Chrome has not explicitly labeled HTTP connections as non-secure. Beginning in January 2017 (Chrome 56), we’ll mark HTTP pages that collect passwords or credit cards as non-secure, as part of a long-term plan to mark all HTTP sites as non-secure. In following releases, we will continue to extend HTTP warnings, for example, by labeling HTTP pages as “not secure” in Incognito mode, where users may have higher expectations of privacy. Eventually, we plan to label all HTTP pages as non-secure, and change the HTTP security indicator to the red triangle that we use for broken HTTPS.” So far, we've not seen the “not secure” label, we've only seen the already familiar gray circled letter “i” displayed in browser address bars when websites are not secure. Here’s an example using Best Buy’s website (below). Google has, however, amped up their labeling of secure websites, like Adorama’s (below). Labeling now includes a green padlock, the word “Secure”, and the green letters “https” on all websites that have been completely and successfully converted. Implications For Website Owners If you own a website that captures userIDs and passwords or credit card data, you'll soon be labeled as “Not Secure” when visitors are using the Chrome browser. This is bound to raise concerns and deter people from wanting to transact with you, especially if you’re asking for any type of personal data - email addresses, for example, to build your mailing list.  Website visitors will easily be able to recognize unsecure websites and find better, more secure, alternatives. If you own an informational (non-eCommerce) website and think you’re off the hook, think again. Non-eCommerce website owners also risk losing the trust and confidence of website visitors. 25% of the world’s websites are built with Wordpress, a content management system that is accessed, administered, and maintained using a UserID and password. Joomla and Drupal, Wordpress’s closest competitors, also use userIDs and passwords. These sites will eventually be flagged as non-secure unless they are converted over to HTTPS. As a website owner, you should also be aware that anyone who intercepts the transmission of userID and password data will be able to add, change and delete content on your website. It’s not only website visitors who are at risk, website owners also need to protect their data. Implications For SEO In addition to the obvious benefit of securing the trust and confidence of your audience, there is also a search engine optimization (SEO) benefit when you migrate over to HTTPS. Google announced HTTPS as a ranking factor in 2014. “For now it's only a very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries, and carrying less weight than other signals such as high-quality content — while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. But over time, we may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.” At the time, the lightweight incentive wasn’t enough to motivate most non-eCommerce website owners to migrate because of the work involved and the potential to lose SEO equity. When you convert your website to HTTPS, you're effectively changing your Internet address - that means you should give Google (and other search engines) a “change of address” notification, also known as a 301 or 302 redirect. Traditionally, a redirect diluted your SEO equity or ability to rank by as much as 15%. That recently changed. In February 2016, Google’s John Mueller announced that SEO equity or PageRank will no longer be lost when a 301 or 302 redirect is used in conjunction with an HTTP to HTTPS migration. Skeptical SEO’s doubted the truth of this but in July 2016, another Google employee, Gary Illyes, tweeted the same thing and Barry Schwartz at Search Engine Land confirmed it.  There's no longer an SEO penalty when you implement HTTPS. The previously lightweight signal could actually help boost your rankings. Now Ann and other website visitors can feel safe knowing secure-labeled websites will protect their identity and data. Website owners can too.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Huawei Competitions Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Routers & Networking Software Trending: Nintendo Switch Nokia 3310 iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / Software News / Microsoft just lost a title it has held for more than two decades Microsoft just lost a title it has held for more than two decades by Luke Johnson 13 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Google's Android is no longer just the world’s most popular smartphone software, it’s now the most used operating system in the world, period. Taking a crown that Microsoft has held for almost three decades, Google’s smartphone system has taken over the title of the world’s most popular operating system in terms of internet usage. That’s according to figures compiled by StatCounter that show that Android’s meteoric rise in popularity has now seen it surpass Windows as the OS of choice for more than a third of the world’s internet users. Given that virtually every computer and phone is now connected to the web in some capacity, this is pretty solid metric on which to base success. The latest figures show that Android currently powers a staggering 37.93% of world’s internet-connected devices. This just edges out the 37.91% of devices still running Microsoft’s Windows platform across computer, tablet and smartphone form factors and marks the first time Microsoft has been knocked off top spot since the ‘80s. Related: Best Smartphones 2017 “This is milestone in technology history and the end of an era,” said Aodhan Cullen, CEO of StatCounter. “It marks the end of Microsoft’s leadership worldwide of the OS market which it has held since the 1980s. It also represents a major breakthrough for Android which held just 2.4% of global internet usage share only five years ago.” Google’s stranglehold on 80% of the global smartphone market is a huge foundation on which to build, and Microsoft’s previously unobtainable OS lead has been shattered in recent years due to the company’s lack of standing in the smartphone space. Still the dominant force in the laptop and desktop space, powering 84% of machines, Microsoft’s Windows platform powers just 1% of the smartphone market. Now that Android has overtaken Windows as the world’s most popular OS, it’s hard to see how Microsoft can retake its crown without more of a stake in the smartphone space.

Google Map Maker is officially dead Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 8:46am PDTApr 2, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Google News Google Map Maker was introduced back in 2008, as a way for users to make contributions to Google Maps. Features like roads, highways, rivers, and so on could be added to Maps, and users could fill in details about businesses and other specific locations. After some vandalism occurred thanks to Google's poor moderation, the feature was removed entirely, and re-appeared later with less functionality. Google has been working to integrate Map Maker features into Google Maps itself, and announced in November that the independent Map Maker service would shut down. Now Map Maker is officially dead. Google's support page says that most of Map Maker's functionality is already in Maps, and the company will continue to add new features as time goes on.

But... But... Oh wait, I got nothing. Leo Herzog If I have an edit to contribute to a park or college campus boundary, how am I supposed to do that? 😆😄 "Suggest an edit" on the location. Leo Herzog There is no "Suggest an edit" on a polygon like a campus border. 😆😄 Don't have my phone handy... but on desktop you can right click anywhere and "Add a missing place" Leo Herzog I don't really want to add a missing place though... 😆😄 Well, if you want to edit something that already exists, like the polygon of a campus or park, that polygon should have a label that you can click on to suggest an edit. Leonardo Baez Sadly in my country is blocked. There are several errors in street names, and some streets have changed circulation direction. Randroid Try using the "Feedback" button in Maps. Leonardo Baez Limited option only (add missing places) you cannot add or edit streets aRvInD I was proud Regional lead in that program but after whole Android pissing on Apple fiasco, functionality got heavily restricted. i knew they soon will kill this program... iMarbot "Google's support page says that most of Map Maker's functionality is already in Maps"... biggest lie I have heard ALL YEAR Sruly J You must not get out much. ;) Travis Halfman Alternative Facts.

Randroid Actually it's not, it's just done differently. You have to suggest an edit, then your edit is approved or denied. I've done it multiple times within the Maps Android app. Rob Cook The best part is when they deny your edit for being inaccurate and you have to submit a photo to prove your right. caruso81 What does this do to making custom points of interest and uploading to your GPS? (I'm aware GPS units are dead and the mobile phone is the way to go. I'm also aware that US carrier data in Europe is obscenely priced and that I already own a GPS with hundreds of custom POIs loaded onto it.) IVBela What if I want to mark duplicate places? Oh nevermind... Randroid You use the "Feedback" button in Maps Leonardo Baez this is buls*** There are many countries were the only source for trusted information is the comunity. With this change now we cannot change street names, street directions, allowed and prohibited turns, add returns or new road crosses. This is buls*** google. When in hell will you designate a team to do maps of bolivia, or agola or suriname? We the users are the contributors because no one else gives tools or trusted maps as google. And now all the maps will be frozen in time circa 2015 (because for many countries google stopped edits in 2015). I'm mad as hell TannoV If you'd actually read the article, you'd have read that the functionality has been integrated into Google maps. Tomáš Petrík And if you'd actually tried that, you'd have found out that you can only add/edit places like businesses and other POIs. However, it is not possible to rename a street, edit directions and/or turns, etc. modeless And if *you'd* actually tried that, you would have seen that as a Local Guide it is possible to rename a street, edit segment attributes and also report missing roads. Martin I am a local guide, but I can't find how you rename a street. Could you point me in the right direction? Or are you supposed to use the Feedback function? Leonardo Baez I'm local guide level 5 living in Bolivia. Its not possible here roberto.elena Re editing directions and/or turns: There is a workaround for this. I've used it several times, because Map Maker was never available in Spain (one of the 20 or so countries out of 200 that wasn't lucky enough). What you do is set a route between 2 points that pass through that street or a make that turn you want to edit, and then use the feedback tool to report where the problem is. As I said, I've used it several times to correct illegal turns. Leonardo Baez Yeah... But no. You can only add places (business, comerce,etc) I dont know if in the US is avaible the full ediriong options butnoutside the US it is not. Upvotes4Bird Thanks to Google's poor moderation? Thanks to shitty users. poop. It was both. Grey Map Maker had a piece of shit moderation community with bullshit, "what we want" rules. Trying to correct an issue is a nightmare. Trying to add something is a nightmare. No way to add building corrections after the vandalism. Trying to add a path that goes by a road is not allowed sometimes - despite tons of these paths existing. And they use Google Street View - despite Google Street View being quite a bit off the ground and giving a warped perspective. I love the idea behind Map Maker, I hate the moderation community and their stupid idea of rules. poop. It's still like this even with the "new" system Grey That is awful news Randroid Unfortunately, without these kinds of rules we get things like what happened in the vandalism instance. Grey They can allow proper trail mapping without it being vandalism. They don't want trails to be used for sidewalks, so if a trail goes near a road sometimes they'll argue it's a sidewalk. But sometimes it's not! And fuck you if you want to discuss it. jdrch Google killed another product users were relying on? No way! Stop the presses! Unheard of! Adrianus AJ Nadeak Map Maker was not working in one country used to live in. I did manage to name a street using Map Maker years ago but then it stopped working. With the country's frantic construction rate, many new roads have been built or redirected and as a result, Google Maps isn't as accurate as my current location. Many roundabouts have been converted to traffic signal intersections and a section of a new ring road is non existent. POI and places can be edited and added within the Maps app so that's not much of an issue. Janet Scott Again bad performance by Google. it's usage mistake by Google again.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Greg Abbott https://kodi.tv/ Sergio Carmona Scariest one... seriously... Artem Russakovskii Not even a 503 or something? Just a 200? Ballsy re: SEO. SickoPsycho oops- beat me to it. Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? Greg Abbott Doubt it, technically a website isn't an official document. mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed. JG It isn't technically April Fools Day yet... Least not in the US...

Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day.

Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell / VentureBeat Google today announced a software update for its Google Wifi routers. Now it’s possible to temporarily block internet signal in your home for a set period of time on a regular basis. The idea for the “scheduled pause” feature came out of the life experience of Google product manager Edith Chao. She explains in a blog post: While exploring how to best create tools for families, I noticed that I was having trouble falling asleep. I’d check emails and surf the web late into the night. Experimenting with options, I started using a timer on my computer to turn the internet off at 11 p.m. The first night was a shock, but after a few nights I was ready to shut down earlier. And I was more refreshed and rejuvenated in the morning. This is one of the first few app updates to Google Wifi since Google revealed the system a few months ago. The software features really do make the hardware appealing, and now Google is adding a new one. This is in addition to the ability to pause Wi-Fi temporarily for all devices or a specific device. Samsung introduced a mesh network router system last month. Smaller companies like Eero and Luma also offer home routers that run mesh networks for multiple units.

Khan, the architect of Chicago’s John Hancock Center and Sears Tower. Google celebrated the 88th birthday of a man who has become near and dear to millions of Chicagoans, even if they don’t know it. Monday’s Google Doodle, a daily drawing housed on the site’s homepage, honored Fazlur R. Khan, the architect of Chicago’s John Hancock Center and Sears Tower. It pictures his image alongside a drawing of the Hancock. “As a youth my father never imagined that one day he would be building skyscrapers,” Khan’s daughter, Yasmin Sabina Khan, wrote in a statement. “A humanitarian in his personal as well as professional life, he was inspired by the belief that his work had a positive impact and he encouraged other engineers not to lose track of the purpose of their profession,” Sabina Khan said. Khan designed the 100-story Hancock building in 1965 using the “trussed tube” structural system, and in 1971 he designed the Sears Tower, now the Willis Tower, “using his latest innovation, the ‘bundled tube.'” At the time, the Sears Tower was the tallest building in the world. It would retain that title for 22 more years.  At age 42, Khan was named him Construction’s Man of the Year by Engineering News-Record in 1972. When he was awarded the honor, he said, “The technical man must not be lost in his own technology. He must be able to appreciate life, and life is art, drama, music and, most importantly, people.” “His innovations subsequently formed the basis of tall building design,” his daughter said. Khan worked for the Chicago design firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill until his death in 1982, she said.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 53 Plus 1 on G+ 137 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares273 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like the Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

Kappa saf1927 What is VR again? Ah, some shit that everyone likes to experience once and then realises it's shit. Morten Ulv I must have missed the part where it's shit. Kevin It was actually cool. It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD Adrian Meredith Hmm what? Vr is incredible can't go back to playing elite on a 2d screen Jesse Lee You must be using Daydream VR and not Oculus because you would have realized you're comment is complete shit. George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.) MicroNix And you think that would be fair when it was Samsung that was to market much earlier with VR than Google? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Sorry to break it to you. But cardboard was out in June of 2014. Gear vr didn't get released until like november of 2015. Over a year later. And at that time, it was basically just a plastic google cardboard. Willie Chalmers III Well, Cardboard was introduced at I/O in May 2014, and Gear VR was released in November 2015. Daydream was released in November 2016. Does that make it any more fair? It doesn't matter if it's fair, I'm just explaining Google's options. I'm not happy about the prospects, but I noted that Google could make Daydream a requirement for GMS at the risk of an antitrust lawsuit.

Willie Chalmers III Yeah, I noted that. That's the unfortunate reality of corporate politics. JohnyNoLegs Maybe since Samsung comes up with everything great in Android, Google should be the one using Samsung rather than the other way. Samsung Gear VR is and has been far better for ages. Kawshik Ahmed Google can't implement Gear VR to Android because it's not Open Source rather it is own by Oculus/Facebook. If a OEM share their technology with AOSP, Google have no problem to implement it, take for example Sony, who shared 50+ enhancement in Android O alone. X-47B or think Google - who don't add even the latest google search to AOSP. Is latest chrome, google assistant part of AOSP? Samsung shared KNOX with google, which they are not supposed to. Kawshik Ahmed Chrome has it's own Open Source form named Chromium so it doesn't need to be with AOSP. Anyone can use it like Opera and many others are doing. Google Search and Assistant are not features or enhancement nor part of the actual OS, they are services and it takes money to maintain the servers to run them. I don't think any company will make their services open sourced. It's like saying Samsung should open source Bixby which will never happen. blueman24 That would be good only if samsung made any polished software plus made it open source. JohnyNoLegs Google can't even do that so not sure what you are inferring. illregal Said no one ever. Samsung is a disease. Holding back true innovation with their lackluster devices. Diogo Neves Yeah, the competition really looks fierce for Samsung lol illregal buying reviews, paying to badmouth your competition, marketing dollars and dumbasses eating it up doesn't mean the device is any good. It means you've been had. JohnyNoLegs Sounds like Apple to me haha. Pixel isn't far behind... Good_Ole_Pinocchio No need to support Daydream. There's zero benefit to Samsung. MJ Yes, customer needs are of no concern to Samsung also like updates. billy routh Samsung has their own VR and it's Miles ahead of Google's crappy daydream. Chris Sanner that's...nice? but it means lock-in - if I'm on a nexus/pixel and I leave for a samsung phone...I lose what content I had. if I decide that's fine and move to samsung, if I want to leave and go back to a pixel I lose the content. that means I have to be willing to bet that I will *always* buy Samsung. and guess what - I'm not. Anthony820 And when I switch to Canon I lose all my Nikon lenses. And when I switch back I lose all my canon. And went I switched from iPhone I lost all my apps and had to re-purchase them for a new OS. I say everyone fully endorses their competition's ecosystem of services/products. Chris Sanner um...except this is like someone making a canon-based camera and refusing to support the new cannon attachments on the next release. that's kinda shitty and would be enough to keep me from buying the cannon-based camera OligarchyAmbulance "Miles ahead" lol ok Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of all customer needs, DayDream support is absolute last on that list. No need for it. They want VR? They'll get a freeheadset JohnyNoLegs Lol samsung VR??? And who needs breaking updates. MJ I am not sure why Samsung VR is so funny and... No updates for you huh? Are you one of those people still using Windows XP on their PC? JohnyNoLegs Samsung be is available for customers of Samsung, and it's far better than Daydream still. And no I'm on pixel xl running 7.1.2, but really it's the same as 7.0 so no benefit of having pixel for the past 5 months. AsterMK Daydream is far from a need. It's a want, and barely anyone wants VR in general. Of those that do want it, almost everyone prefers Gear VR. Ra1nb0wD4sh DE I would totally get a HTC Vive, but it's too expensive atm. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They want you to use GearVR MJ Yes, which is the opposite of giving customer choice aka what they may want. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Corporations don't care what you want Rob Cook Your argument is invalid, Samsung isn't forced to provide Daydream as they have developed, in their opinion a superior alternative. The customer choice here is to not buy Samsung if you feel that Daydream is the better product (arguably it's not). You logic is saying that Samsung MUST provide Daydream as well or there isn't a choice being offered at all. That's like saying that Cheverolet MUST offer a V12 quad-turbo in the Corvett because Bugatti offers one in the Chiron. Yes both are cars but that's it. MJ Ummmm The argument I never made is invalid? OK... Dude, I never said Samsung should be REQUIRED to provide Daydream support. I did infer Samsung should should give their customers options. LOL I do agree about NOT buying Samsung products. It is amazing to me all comments defending Samsung on this. Who doesn't like options and prefers a walled garden? Oh yeah... Your analogy was really stupid by the way. What I am saying is the what Ford does with their touch screen system in supporting Apples' CarPlay and Android Auto is better way to go than just supporting one or the other or using a proprietary only system. Jesse Lee Well then why didn't Google offer Oculus support on its Pixel phones....no customer support needs I guess. This was a no-brainer, I thought anyway but.... Dave I will not buy a S8 without Daydream. I was going to finally buy my first new phone since the Note 2, but now think I will wait for the Pixel 2. Mike549 They're losing my purchase of an s8 because of it. I already have the s7 with gear VR but I want access to Daydream too. YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They chose not to support it because they are not idiots. Why would they risk losing VR market share? MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. illregal Samsung copied google here.. There's no debate, gear vr came out way after cardboard. samsung pay, etc.. All out after google. Samsung hasn't had an original thought in years, unless it has to do with ripping off their idiot customers. JohnyNoLegs I didn't know Cardboard had sensors in it..... I thought it was just a piece of cardboard with a lense... dhamp2g Cardboard was 1st dude!!! JohnyNoLegs Then VR with actual sensors and lag free use came out... DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. illregal oculus is proprietary crap and losing badly to vive. Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Ryan IMHO Gear and daydream provide the very same experience in term of quality. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Mike549 Verizon stores have Daydream devices for demo purposes. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. Klark Kenneth Wait, are you saying it's a fail or are you saying "No? FAIL."? MJ "Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL." What the hell is that supposed to mean? Jesse Lee Dude, stop trolling. Nexus phones were made by Google, the N6 was less then 2 years old when Daydream VR came out and Google didn't even support it. Yet, you're comments seem to contradict that reality and keep bashing Sammy when Google's support is much much worse when it comes to VR. You're barking up the wrong tree is how the expression goes and its apparent from reading this section. MJ Speak about trolling... The OP statement I quoted made so sense so I asked him to explain it. What does that have to do with you buddy? Daydream is NOT supported on the Nexus 6? So what? You need minimal hardware support for a good experience so it's better than something like Cardboard. FACT: Samsung’s first consumer Gear VR headset didn't support any previous Samsung phones either. FACT: Goggle Daydream is open to other OEMs while Samsung's VR solution is NOT. Now go away... Mike549 Agreed. I think the same applies to the Rift and Vive for exclusive too. Ryan The most targeted platform is Cardboard... ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Sudev Together but not the same :) Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. Ryan I disagree it's a bit like the console/PC war non sense. While I understand people might want to only experience it on PC for obvious reasons there are a lot of smaller players that are enjoying mobile VR a lot. While it's true there is a lot of crap in the store there are some really good games. Jon Fridman VR on phones doesn't look anywhere near as good based on experience. Consoles are irrelevant to this as well because they still don't have the raw power a PC can (yes thst includes the PS VR headset). While the graphics may look decent, they can't compare to higher end systems. Once VR has matured I think it'll be fine to use on phones. In the current state I cannot see a reason to use a VR headset. I won't buy one for my PC either despite having a more than capable set up (i7 6800K/EVGA 1080FTW/32GB RAM). When the next generation comes out I'll likely buy one. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol op12 Daydream expanded beyond the Pixel a while ago... https://vr.google.com/daydream/phones/#daydream-ready-phones Jesse Lee Yeah, it works great on any phone now named Pixel Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Atoqir Well that is saying like "Why do my PS4 exclusives don't work on Xbox" There is always some artificial lockout to make a platform more attractive. And I don't think it's a bad thing. It makes competitors do better and create the best platform for the biggest chunk of users. And the least popular loses and doesn't have a vibrant ecosystem. Look at Windows Mobile as prime example. Cause we are not talking about regular hardware products anymore. These days every products is a weapon the "wars of the ecosystems/platforms" Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Ryan VR is not pleasing for everyone.But there are a lot of people that love it. kalehv Oh I love it too. but there's not much to do yet. Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR. Ryan And this is why, as a VR Dev , I only target cardboard for now. Hope the VR future will be brighter and easier for everyone! It is a really good medium. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So you'd rather target a limited audience rather than a large one? How is this a good business decision? darkvadur 1 April??..... Sudev Together but not the same :) Mike549 I was going to get the S8 if it supported both platforms but not now. I'll just keep my S7 and get a Daydream compatible phone if an interesting one comes out soon. Sean Thomas to be fair...daydream is bad. I haven't used Gear VR, but Daydream isn't worth it right now if they already have a platform with more support. Daydream shouldn't be on par with oculus if it's bad tbh. Google should just work with oculus to make an android-wide deal. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Serious question: Does the Pixel / Pixel XL support Gear VR? Jordan L probably not, I'm guessing Gear VR is a Samsung exclusive thing. Whereas Daydream is available to all. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Isn't Gear VR the same VR as Oculus? If so, it's not Samsung exclusive. Jordan L I don't know. I thought it was called Samsung Gear VR. Oculus has a VR framework that is available to cell phone makers? If that's true, then Daydream should work work that, I agree. A big part of Daydream was the ability for other companies to join in. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I googled it. Yes, Samsung Gear VR is powered by Oculus. So it's probably going to have the most content, which is what will make it the most successful VR. If it turns out Daydream gets the most content, then I'm sure Samsung will support it. Otherwise they'll lose customers. This is no different than prior format wars like Betamax vs. VHS or HD DVD vs. Blu-ray. Whoever gets the most content wins. Jordan L Fragmentation. Google allows all companies to attempt to do Daydream... so Samsung does their own thing. Chris Sanner Dear Samsung: this sort of shit is why I refuse to buy any more of your phones. like, ever. dhamp2g WTF this type of shit kills me. Why wouldn't google make it required to use android?????. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Why does it bother you? If Daydream wins the VR competition, then Samsung will either lose customers or be forced to support Daydream. If Gear VR wins, then Google and Daydream phones will either lose customers or be forced to support it. That's the way the free market works. dhamp2g bc I bought a daydream when it was on sale bc I though 4sure that the s8 would support it. I will get the next pixel when it comes out and ditch my s8 and use my s7 for gearVR. I wanted one phone for both. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck with that! I don't care about VR, but if I did, I'd get the phone that supports VR with the most content. That's what determines the end game. Suicide_Note VR is crap, and anything that speeds its demise is fine by me. https://media0.giphy.com/media/d4aTnvQuF6xyfgWI/giphy.gif kgptzac Anyone with a brain should not find this surprising, and should be easily see the reasons behind it. Once again the burden falls to developers to either make exclusives, or games that support multiple VR platforms. It's not unfair either... developers have always been choosing between sony and microsoft on consoles, and google and apple on mobile, so it's fair game. likurges daydream is a gimmick. useless crap in it's current form. On the other hand samsung is an ass for not supporting it Averix No great loss. VR is a fad for right now. The lack of content makes that obvious. Since they're giving away a headset for the Samsung Oculus experience, I don't think Daydream matters much here. Jesse Lee "Could" be Samsung's deal with Oculus?! Absolutely it has to do with the competing VR platform offered by Oculus. I guess I never would have thought they were going to and never got hopes up for it just the same as I never thought the Pixel was going to include Oculus software, kind of a no-brainer really. Jordan L It's possible the Samsung could support both VR's, and maybe Oculus is elusive to Samsung? So pixel couldn't support both platforms. If that's true, then one could hope Samsung would support both.(it was a long shot). Daydream is open to all manufactures... Is Oculus?

Name: Subject: Message: 5 things Android Wear can learn from the Apple Watch Featuresby Dane O'Leary13 hours ago 20 210 9 While Android and iOS continue to be embroiled in the battle for smartphone OS supremacy, there’s another war that’s waging in the shadows: the War of the Wearables. Of course, calling it a war might be overkill, since overall wearable sales have been in a decline. Then again, there were 6 million Apple Watches sold during Q4 of 2016, which is a year-over-year increase of 12 percent. To put that into perspective, there were a total of 9 million smartwatches sold during that time, so Apple’s acclaimed wearable accounted for more than 60 percent of all smartwatch sales. In case that’s not clear, Apple Watch has been the top-selling smartwatch since its debut in 2014. Market data reveals that there are many more iPhone users buying the Apple Watch than there are Android users buying Android Wear smartwatches.   As for smartphones, Android has roughly an 82 percent market share while iOS accounts for 18 percent of the smartphone market. This disparity shouldn’t be that surprising since there are more than 24,000 different Android devices on the market while iOS is found only on iPhones. However, Android Wear sales are only a fraction of the sales of Apple Watch. To be clear, this means there are many more iPhone users buying the Apple Watch than there are Android users buying Android Wear smartwatches. (And Android Wear smartwatches are typically cross-compatible, too!) It boils down to this: Even though wearables haven’t gained the popularity many OEMs had hoped, sales show that the Apple Watch’s reception has been considerably more positive than Android Wear devices. So what can Android Wear learn from Apple Watch to be a greater success? The Apple advantage One of Apple’s greatest advantages is that the company controls both its devices’ hardware and software. In fact, this is why Apple devices are usually industry-leading performers despite technically having lesser specs than competing Android smartphones. Even if you’re not a fan of Apple products, it’s hard not to have respect for them. When a company can marry each meticulously-written line of code to very deliberately-chosen hardware, you end up with a device that’s truly remarkable. Until recently, Google software was found only on third-party hardware. Then Google introduced the Pixel smartphones (as well as wireless routers, a speaker equipped with a new voice assistant, and a Chromecast with 4K) last year; however, the company has never released its own Android Wear smartwatch on which Google’s wearable OS could run. To date, the only smartwatches running Android Wear are made by third-party companies like LG, Huawei, and Lenovorola,which has surely contributed to the luke-warm sales of Android Wear smartwatches compared to those made by Apple. See also: Google delays Android Wear 2.0 update rollout for most smartwatches 5 days ago Having so many different companies making Android Wear smartwatches ensures variety, but it can easily be overwhelming, especially for a first-timer. Here’s an example: Billy decides he wants an Android Wear smartwatch after seeing Bob using Android Wear’s mobile payment function to pay for his lunch. Although he’s not super familiar with wearables, Billy figures he’ll head over to Best Buy and pick up one of the latest Android Wear smartwatches. A few days later, Billy is at the pharmacy trying to use his LG Style at the checkout counter and realizes that his brand new Android Wear smartwatch doesn’t actually support mobile payments. How can that be? If Google made its own wearable hardware, not only would Android Wear devices be much stronger performers, it would make the wearable market seem much less “inside baseball”, so to speak. Most consumers would expect Google-made smartwatches to offer just about every possible Android Wear feature; meanwhile, many third-party smartwatches fail to take full advantage of all the features Android Wear has to offer. In other words, it’s the third-party manufacturers that are compromising the Android Wear experience. And just like many consider the Pixel smartphones to offer the best Android experience, many of us would be inclined to prefer Android Wear devices made in-house by Google to those made by virtually any other company. More fluidity in the UI For first-time smartwatch users, neither Android Wear nor watchOS are as intuitive as they could be, with both involving somewhat of a learning curve. Of course, once you’ve learned the interface, it’s a matter of preference as to whether you think Android Wear or watchOS is a better experience. Having said that, there’s a certain je ne sais pais the Apple Watch has that’s distinctly lacking on Android Wear. There’s not a singular word for it, but when you use the two wearable platforms side-by-side, you start to get a feel for what has made the Apple Watch so popular. Much like iOS, Apple’s watchOS is very fluid and elegant. Once you get past the learning curve, navigating the platform feels very intuitive and functional, but without sacrificing form. By comparison, the appearance of Android Wear — while very Material Design-esque and ‘current’ in the Android world — feels like it’ll look dated much sooner than the UI of watchOS. Apple's watchOS is very fluid and elegant. By comparison, the appearance of Android Wear feels like it’ll look dated much sooner than the UI of watchOS. Not-so-elegant notifications Speaking of the Android Wear design language, the card-based setup — which is obviously a call to the notification cards you see in Android — doesn’t really translate to a wearable platform. Although notifications are more fleshed-out in Android Wear than in watchOS, as you’re swiping through notification cards, you can’t help but feel like it’s taking you way too many swipes to find the information you’re looking for. There’s no intuitive way to isolate the notification or function you need without being forced to sift through other notifications or functions to find it. An appropriate analogy is that it feels like you’re panning for gold, waiting for all the dirt to fall away and reveal what it was you’d wanted to find. Consequently, you feel like you’d wasted a lot of time while navigating notifications on Android Wear. Depending on how you look at it, notifications on the Apple Watch may not seem all that different from Android Wear, but when you consider it from a practical perspective, the difference is more noticeable. On Android Wear, notifications are individual cards and each card must be swiped before you can access the next one. The Apple Watch’s notifications are much sleeker and more intuitive, putting your notifications into a single feed that you can navigate by rotating the crown on the side of the watch like a dial. This allows you to click onto only the notifications you want rather than having to sift through them like you’re cutting your watch out of a jungle with a machete. Again, it’s a small difference, but arguably a significant one. Hardware controls Although this seems to be changing with LG’s latest Android Wear devices, the vast majority of previous Android wearables had software-only controls. Of course, this isn’t necessarily a problem, especially if you’re someone who prefers tapping and swiping to physical buttons and knobs; however, the so-called ‘Digital Crown’ on the Apple Watch can be rotated like a dial, allowing users to navigate many areas of watchOS without having to rely on touching and swiping and, consequently, covering up the display. Again, it’s a matter of preference, but Apple Watch at least offers a choice between software and hardware controls. Plus, if you’ve ever used an Apple Watch, you’ll know that the crown has a really great feel to it and adds to both the high-end look and feel of Apple wearables. Hardware controls allow users to navigate the user interface without having to rely on touching and swiping and, consequently, covering up the display. Unapologetically smart Take some of the most recent Android Wear smartwatches — i.e., the LG Watch Style, the LG Watch Sport, the Huawei Watch 2 — and put them next to the Apple Watch 2. What do you notice? If your answer was that the Android Wear watches seem to be trying to masquerade as regular watches while the Apple Watch is unapologetically smart, you hit the nail on the proverbial head. One of the things that makes the Apple Watch great is that it embraces its smartness, which has to have been a contributor to its success; it doesn’t provoke comparisons because it’s not trying to be something it’s not. Meanwhile, you can’t help but to compare Android Wear watches to regular non-smart watches because they’re essentially trying to be conventional watches that offer smartwatch features. On the one hand, the fact that most Android Wear devices look like regular wristwatches helps them to blend in and not stick out like Apple Watches tend to do. On the other hand, it also invites comparison and makes you more aware of the additional weight, the bulk, the fact that you have to keep them charged, and so on. In a way, it’s like Android Wear holds itself back by trying to stay within the confines of convention while the Apple Watch isn’t afraid to be something totally different. Up next: Best smartwatches (March 2017) 3 weeks ago Notice that many of the lessons Android Wear can learn from the Apple Watch are conceptual rather than functional. When it comes down to it, the latest iterations of both watchOS and Android Wear share many of the same key features, including mobile payments, third-party apps, changeable bands and watchfaces, fitness capabilities, ad infinitum. However, the fact that the Apple Watch has been selling exponentially better than all Android Wear devices combined is telling, especially considering that there are far more Android users than iOS users these days. But these moderate course-corrections could make a significant difference to the usability, experience, and sales of Android Wear. What do you think about Android Wear?

Although it may come as a surprise to some, when attempting to download the Daydream app on the S8 or S8+ to use it with Samsung’s Gear VR headset, you’ll receive an error message. It’s not as if the S8 or S8+ is incapable of supporting Daydream given both new flagship devices are powerful and meet all the requirements for the Daydream platform. Samsung’s Gear VR is far more developed and has a wider range of content on it when compared to Google’s relatively recently released Daydream service. However, it’s important to keep in mind that Daydream has only been out for less than half a year and that Google, as well as third-party developers, have been releasing software for the headset at a rapid pace. According to VRHeads, Galaxy S8 and S8+ users may be able to use Daydream, though doing so may void the device’s warranty.  There is apparently a single line of code that prevents Galaxy S8 owners from using Daydream headsets. To access the code you need root access to the S8 or S8+. Samsung is currently offering a special promotion in Canada where all customers who pre-order the phone will get a free Gear VR.

There’s still the hope that Samsung will enable it in a software update (maybe they didn’t get their certification in time for release day) but the lack of response on their part on this issue concerns me. They claim to be all about choices, then turn around and lock their customers out of a VR platform that would compete with their own. hardy83 They are all about choices…. with their proprietary hardware and software. lol Don’t worry thought. I’m sure people will hack the Daydream app or S8 phones to get it working on them. 1messager Yeah i hope they will fix it in a update Andrew English There is a lot of incorrect information on the internet. So you have to be careful and mobilsyrup is good at reporting using the incorrect information. Remember the internet doesn’t hold 100% factual information, it’s just up the users/consumers to decide is true and what is fishy. 🙂 1messager That don’t work on the lg g6 neither and all pf this really suprise me. Kent Ratke To be honest, why someone would choose a samsung device at all perplexes me. I had an S7 for two weeks as a loaner phone while I was being shipped a new Pixel and the amount of bloatware was shocking. Andrew English Personal preference. All cell phones come with bloatware that the carriers decide to have preinstalled by the manufacture.The preinstalled stuff can be disabled while the remaining can be removed if you choose not to use or have any need for. No big deal.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 53 Plus 1 on G+ 137 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares273 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like the Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

Kappa saf1927 What is VR again? Ah, some shit that everyone likes to experience once and then realises it's shit. Morten Ulv I must have missed the part where it's shit. Kevin It was actually cool. It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD Adrian Meredith Hmm what? Vr is incredible can't go back to playing elite on a 2d screen Jesse Lee You must be using Daydream VR and not Oculus because you would have realized you're comment is complete shit. George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.) MicroNix And you think that would be fair when it was Samsung that was to market much earlier with VR than Google? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Sorry to break it to you. But cardboard was out in June of 2014. Gear vr didn't get released until like november of 2015. Over a year later.

Daydream was released in November 2016. Does that make it any more fair? It doesn't matter if it's fair, I'm just explaining Google's options. I'm not happy about the prospects, but I noted that Google could make Daydream a requirement for GMS at the risk of an antitrust lawsuit.

Willie Chalmers III Yeah, I noted that. That's the unfortunate reality of corporate politics. JohnyNoLegs Maybe since Samsung comes up with everything great in Android, Google should be the one using Samsung rather than the other way. Samsung Gear VR is and has been far better for ages. Kawshik Ahmed Google can't implement Gear VR to Android because it's not Open Source rather it is own by Oculus/Facebook. If a OEM share their technology with AOSP, Google have no problem to implement it, take for example Sony, who shared 50+ enhancement in Android O alone. X-47B or think Google - who don't add even the latest google search to AOSP. Is latest chrome, google assistant part of AOSP? Samsung shared KNOX with google, which they are not supposed to. Kawshik Ahmed Chrome has it's own Open Source form named Chromium so it doesn't need to be with AOSP. Anyone can use it like Opera and many others are doing. Google Search and Assistant are not features or enhancement nor part of the actual OS, they are services and it takes money to maintain the servers to run them. I don't think any company will make their services open sourced. It's like saying Samsung should open source Bixby which will never happen. blueman24 That would be good only if samsung made any polished software plus made it open source. JohnyNoLegs Google can't even do that so not sure what you are inferring. illregal Said no one ever. Samsung is a disease. Holding back true innovation with their lackluster devices. Diogo Neves Yeah, the competition really looks fierce for Samsung lol illregal buying reviews, paying to badmouth your competition, marketing dollars and dumbasses eating it up doesn't mean the device is any good. It means you've been had. JohnyNoLegs Sounds like Apple to me haha. Pixel isn't far behind... Good_Ole_Pinocchio No need to support Daydream. There's zero benefit to Samsung. MJ Yes, customer needs are of no concern to Samsung also like updates. billy routh Samsung has their own VR and it's Miles ahead of Google's crappy daydream. Chris Sanner that's...nice? but it means lock-in - if I'm on a nexus/pixel and I leave for a samsung phone...I lose what content I had. if I decide that's fine and move to samsung, if I want to leave and go back to a pixel I lose the content. that means I have to be willing to bet that I will *always* buy Samsung. and guess what - I'm not. Anthony820 And when I switch to Canon I lose all my Nikon lenses. And when I switch back I lose all my canon. And went I switched from iPhone I lost all my apps and had to re-purchase them for a new OS. I say everyone fully endorses their competition's ecosystem of services/products. Chris Sanner um...except this is like someone making a canon-based camera and refusing to support the new cannon attachments on the next release. that's kinda shitty and would be enough to keep me from buying the cannon-based camera OligarchyAmbulance "Miles ahead" lol ok Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of all customer needs, DayDream support is absolute last on that list. No need for it. They want VR? They'll get a freeheadset JohnyNoLegs Lol samsung VR??? And who needs breaking updates. MJ I am not sure why Samsung VR is so funny and... No updates for you huh? Are you one of those people still using Windows XP on their PC? JohnyNoLegs Samsung be is available for customers of Samsung, and it's far better than Daydream still. And no I'm on pixel xl running 7.1.2, but really it's the same as 7.0 so no benefit of having pixel for the past 5 months. AsterMK Daydream is far from a need. It's a want, and barely anyone wants VR in general. Of those that do want it, almost everyone prefers Gear VR. Ra1nb0wD4sh DE I would totally get a HTC Vive, but it's too expensive atm. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They want you to use GearVR MJ Yes, which is the opposite of giving customer choice aka what they may want. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Corporations don't care what you want Rob Cook Your argument is invalid, Samsung isn't forced to provide Daydream as they have developed, in their opinion a superior alternative. The customer choice here is to not buy Samsung if you feel that Daydream is the better product (arguably it's not). You logic is saying that Samsung MUST provide Daydream as well or there isn't a choice being offered at all. That's like saying that Cheverolet MUST offer a V12 quad-turbo in the Corvett because Bugatti offers one in the Chiron. Yes both are cars but that's it. MJ Ummmm The argument I never made is invalid? OK... Dude, I never said Samsung should be REQUIRED to provide Daydream support. I did infer Samsung should should give their customers options. LOL I do agree about NOT buying Samsung products. It is amazing to me all comments defending Samsung on this. Who doesn't like options and prefers a walled garden? Oh yeah... Your analogy was really stupid by the way. What I am saying is the what Ford does with their touch screen system in supporting Apples' CarPlay and Android Auto is better way to go than just supporting one or the other or using a proprietary only system. Jesse Lee Well then why didn't Google offer Oculus support on its Pixel phones....no customer support needs I guess. This was a no-brainer, I thought anyway but.... Dave I will not buy a S8 without Daydream. I was going to finally buy my first new phone since the Note 2, but now think I will wait for the Pixel 2. Mike549 They're losing my purchase of an s8 because of it. I already have the s7 with gear VR but I want access to Daydream too. YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan They chose not to support it because they are not idiots. Why would they risk losing VR market share? MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. illregal Samsung copied google here.. There's no debate, gear vr came out way after cardboard. samsung pay, etc.. All out after google. Samsung hasn't had an original thought in years, unless it has to do with ripping off their idiot customers. JohnyNoLegs I didn't know Cardboard had sensors in it..... I thought it was just a piece of cardboard with a lense... dhamp2g Cardboard was 1st dude!!! JohnyNoLegs Then VR with actual sensors and lag free use came out... DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. illregal oculus is proprietary crap and losing badly to vive. Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Ryan IMHO Gear and daydream provide the very same experience in term of quality. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Mike549 Verizon stores have Daydream devices for demo purposes. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. Klark Kenneth Wait, are you saying it's a fail or are you saying "No? FAIL."? MJ "Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL." What the hell is that supposed to mean? Jesse Lee Dude, stop trolling. Nexus phones were made by Google, the N6 was less then 2 years old when Daydream VR came out and Google didn't even support it. Yet, you're comments seem to contradict that reality and keep bashing Sammy when Google's support is much much worse when it comes to VR. You're barking up the wrong tree is how the expression goes and its apparent from reading this section. MJ Speak about trolling... The OP statement I quoted made so sense so I asked him to explain it. What does that have to do with you buddy? Daydream is NOT supported on the Nexus 6? So what? You need minimal hardware support for a good experience so it's better than something like Cardboard. FACT: Samsung’s first consumer Gear VR headset didn't support any previous Samsung phones either. FACT: Goggle Daydream is open to other OEMs while Samsung's VR solution is NOT. Now go away... Mike549 Agreed. I think the same applies to the Rift and Vive for exclusive too. Ryan The most targeted platform is Cardboard... ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Sudev Together but not the same :) Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. Ryan I disagree it's a bit like the console/PC war non sense. While I understand people might want to only experience it on PC for obvious reasons there are a lot of smaller players that are enjoying mobile VR a lot. While it's true there is a lot of crap in the store there are some really good games. Jon Fridman VR on phones doesn't look anywhere near as good based on experience. Consoles are irrelevant to this as well because they still don't have the raw power a PC can (yes thst includes the PS VR headset). While the graphics may look decent, they can't compare to higher end systems. Once VR has matured I think it'll be fine to use on phones. In the current state I cannot see a reason to use a VR headset. I won't buy one for my PC either despite having a more than capable set up (i7 6800K/EVGA 1080FTW/32GB RAM). When the next generation comes out I'll likely buy one. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol op12 Daydream expanded beyond the Pixel a while ago... https://vr.google.com/daydream/phones/#daydream-ready-phones Jesse Lee Yeah, it works great on any phone now named Pixel Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Atoqir Well that is saying like "Why do my PS4 exclusives don't work on Xbox" There is always some artificial lockout to make a platform more attractive. And I don't think it's a bad thing. It makes competitors do better and create the best platform for the biggest chunk of users. And the least popular loses and doesn't have a vibrant ecosystem. Look at Windows Mobile as prime example. Cause we are not talking about regular hardware products anymore. These days every products is a weapon the "wars of the ecosystems/platforms" Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Ryan VR is not pleasing for everyone.But there are a lot of people that love it. kalehv Oh I love it too. but there's not much to do yet. Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR. Ryan And this is why, as a VR Dev , I only target cardboard for now. Hope the VR future will be brighter and easier for everyone! It is a really good medium. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So you'd rather target a limited audience rather than a large one? How is this a good business decision? darkvadur 1 April??..... Sudev Together but not the same :) Mike549 I was going to get the S8 if it supported both platforms but not now. I'll just keep my S7 and get a Daydream compatible phone if an interesting one comes out soon. Sean Thomas to be fair...daydream is bad. I haven't used Gear VR, but Daydream isn't worth it right now if they already have a platform with more support. Daydream shouldn't be on par with oculus if it's bad tbh. Google should just work with oculus to make an android-wide deal. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Serious question: Does the Pixel / Pixel XL support Gear VR? Jordan L probably not, I'm guessing Gear VR is a Samsung exclusive thing. Whereas Daydream is available to all. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Isn't Gear VR the same VR as Oculus? If so, it's not Samsung exclusive. Jordan L I don't know. I thought it was called Samsung Gear VR. Oculus has a VR framework that is available to cell phone makers? If that's true, then Daydream should work work that, I agree. A big part of Daydream was the ability for other companies to join in. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I googled it. Yes, Samsung Gear VR is powered by Oculus. So it's probably going to have the most content, which is what will make it the most successful VR. If it turns out Daydream gets the most content, then I'm sure Samsung will support it. Otherwise they'll lose customers. This is no different than prior format wars like Betamax vs. VHS or HD DVD vs. Blu-ray. Whoever gets the most content wins. Jordan L Fragmentation. Google allows all companies to attempt to do Daydream... so Samsung does their own thing. Chris Sanner Dear Samsung: this sort of shit is why I refuse to buy any more of your phones. like, ever. dhamp2g WTF this type of shit kills me. Why wouldn't google make it required to use android?????. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Why does it bother you? If Daydream wins the VR competition, then Samsung will either lose customers or be forced to support Daydream. If Gear VR wins, then Google and Daydream phones will either lose customers or be forced to support it. That's the way the free market works. dhamp2g bc I bought a daydream when it was on sale bc I though 4sure that the s8 would support it. I will get the next pixel when it comes out and ditch my s8 and use my s7 for gearVR. I wanted one phone for both. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck with that! I don't care about VR, but if I did, I'd get the phone that supports VR with the most content. That's what determines the end game. Suicide_Note VR is crap, and anything that speeds its demise is fine by me. https://media0.giphy.com/media/d4aTnvQuF6xyfgWI/giphy.gif kgptzac Anyone with a brain should not find this surprising, and should be easily see the reasons behind it. Once again the burden falls to developers to either make exclusives, or games that support multiple VR platforms. It's not unfair either... developers have always been choosing between sony and microsoft on consoles, and google and apple on mobile, so it's fair game. likurges daydream is a gimmick. useless crap in it's current form. On the other hand samsung is an ass for not supporting it Averix No great loss. VR is a fad for right now. The lack of content makes that obvious. Since they're giving away a headset for the Samsung Oculus experience, I don't think Daydream matters much here. Jesse Lee "Could" be Samsung's deal with Oculus?! Absolutely it has to do with the competing VR platform offered by Oculus. I guess I never would have thought they were going to and never got hopes up for it just the same as I never thought the Pixel was going to include Oculus software, kind of a no-brainer really.

Linux Technology Explained Chromebook vs. Chromebox vs. Chromebit: Which Is Right For You? Dan Price April 3, 2017 03-04-2017 6 minutes Chromebook vs. Chromebox vs. Chromebit: Which Is Right For You? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Google Chromebooks are one of the tech world’s most under-appreciated pieces of equipment. With a boot time of fewer than five seconds, the power of the Chrome Web Store and Google Play Store to keep you productive, and an affordable price tag, they are one of the best computers on the market for performing day-to-day tasks. But if you thought Chromebooks were under-appreciated, what about Chromeboxes and Chromebits? How many of you have even heard of a Chromebit? If you’re looking for a new Chrome OS device, which one should you buy? What are the strengths and weakness of the three types of device? 1. Chromebook Chromebooks need the least explaining. They’re the most common Chrome OS device and the one you’re most likely to see other people using when you’re out and about. In short, they’re a laptop. Lots of different manufacturers make them, they have a variety of specifications, and they are available at a number of price points. Where Chromebooks Excel Chromebooks have great specs for their price. Yes, the Chromebook Pixel for more than $600 is excessive, but the Acer Chromebook R11 ($169) is a steal. It comes with a 360-degree hinge, touchscreen support, a 2.16 GHz Intel processor, and a 1366 x 768 screen resolution. Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6-Inch Laptop (Intel Celeron N2840 Dual-Core Processor,2 GB RAM,16 GB Solid State Drive,Chrome), White Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6-Inch Laptop (Intel Celeron N2840 Dual-Core Processor,2 GB RAM,16 GB Solid State Drive,Chrome), White Intel Celeron N2840 2.16 GHz Buy Now At Amazon $179.00 The Google laptops are also incredibly secure Securing Your Chromebook With Two Easy Tweaks Securing Your Chromebook With Two Easy Tweaks One of the most touted benefits of a Chromebook is its security. But are there any steps that owners can take that will improve and enhance the current level of protection? Read More . They offer automatic updates, sandboxed browsing, verified boot, and localized data encryption — all of which combine to make them almost bulletproof with regards to viruses and malware. Lastly, Chromebooks are excellent for people who struggle with technology.

Where Chromebooks Fall Short People often criticize Chromebooks Chromebooks Don't Work Offline? Debunking the Myths Chromebooks Don't Work Offline? Debunking the Myths One of the biggest criticisms aimed at Google's Chromebooks is that they are online-only machines – ergo, no Internet, no point. How true is this statement? Read More for their meager app line-up. Of course, it’s not really meager at all, there are thousands of extensions in the Chrome Web Store, most modern Chromebook models can run Android apps, and if you’re technically skilled, you can even install Linux How to Install Linux on a Chromebook How to Install Linux on a Chromebook Do you need Skype on your Chromebook? Do you miss not having access to games through Steam? Are you pining to use VLC Media Player? Then start using Linux on your Chromebook. Read More . However, if you need high-end software — such as specialist apps like Photoshop or video editing suites — you will find Chromebooks lacking. Of course, the other Chrome OS devices I’m going to discuss also have the same drawbacks, but the difference is Chromebooks are selling themselves as a laptop; Chromeboxes and Chromebits are not in the targeting the same group of users. Who should buy a Chromebook? The technologically challenged; people who want a second laptop for light computing; people who only use the suite of Google apps; schools for in-class education. 2. Chromebox Let’s move onto the two devices people are less knowledgeable about. First up, Chromeboxes. Chromeboxes first became available in 2012, more than a year and a half after their cousin, Chromebooks. They are best described as a desktop version of Chrome OS. What Are the Specs Like? Like Chromebooks, several manufacturers make them. It means there’s no easy answer to the question what ports are available or what hardware specs you can expect. As a rule, you can expect at least two USB 3.0 ports and an HDMI port. Several models add more USB ports, an audio out jack, Bluetooth support, and an Ethernet port for wired web connectivity. Most Chromeboxes ship with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage, but 4 GB and 32 GB models are available for a bit more money. If you’re adept at electronics, most 2 GB models have space for more self-added RAM. Unfortunately, the majority of models won’t let you swap the graphics card or add extra ports. ASUS CHROMEBOX-M004U Desktop ASUS CHROMEBOX-M004U Desktop 1.4 GHz Intel Celeron 2955U Processor Buy Now At Amazon $158.99 However, don’t let the 2 GB of RAM put you off. While it might be limiting on a Windows or Mac machine, it’s plenty for Chromebooks. 4 GB offers no practical benefits for most users. A Celeron processor is standard, but depending how much you’re willing to spend, you can find models with Intel Core i3, i5, or even i7 processors. What Are the Drawbacks? Even though they are essentially the desktop version of the Chrome OS, they are nothing like a traditional desktop computer you might buy in a shop. They have no screen and they come with no peripherals like a mouse or keyboard. All you get in the box is the device, a power lead, and a manual. Furthermore, there’s no disk drive. Of course, you wouldn’t be able to install software anyway (unless it was Linux compatible and you’d installed a Linux distro on your Chromebox), but the lack of disk drive makes it an unsuitable main desktop machine for anyone who watches a lot of DVDs or listens to CDs. Lastly, it might seem appealing if you want a portable device, but remember, it still needs a power supply. If you want something truly portable and independent, keep reading to find out about Chromebits. Who should buy a Chromebox? People who want a Chromebook experience on a large screen; businesses who need a cheap signage driver. 3. Chromebit The final Chrome OS device is a Chromebit. It’s arguably the least well-known of the three gadgets. What Is a Chromebit? It’s a stick PC Thinking of Buying a Chromecast? Buy a Stick PC Instead Thinking of Buying a Chromecast?

Read More . It doesn’t need a power supply — you just plug it into an HDMI port on your TV and you’ll have Chrome OS on your screen in seconds. What Are Chromebit’s Advantages? Chromebits have two significant advantages over the other Chrome OS devices. First, they’re cheap. The Asus CS10 is only $78.99 on Amazon. It comes with Bluetooth 4.0, 16 GB of flash storage, and a USB 2.0 port. Second, they’re extremely portable. Its ability to run off a USB power supply means you can plug-and-play it into most modern displays. If you want to take a presentation with you to a meeting, carry a full version of the Chrome OS to your school or college, or need an easy-to-use operating system in a hotel, Chromebits are your best bet. ASUS CHROMEBIT CS10 Stick-Desktop PC with RockChip 3288-C 2 GB LPDDR3L 16 GB eMMC Google Chrome OS ASUS CHROMEBIT CS10 Stick-Desktop PC with RockChip 3288-C 2 GB LPDDR3L 16 GB eMMC Google Chrome OS Smallest Chrome OS device, turn any HDMI display into a computer Buy Now At Amazon $91.73 It also the smallest of the three options. The small black dongle is a similar size to a Roku stick and on most TVs will be invisible when looking directly at the screen. But Chromebits Aren’t for Everyone The cost and portability comes at a price. They’re considerably less powerful than fully-fledged Chromebooks and Chromeboxes. The biggest drawback is the device’s power. Chromebit has a 1.8 GHz Rockchip processor which, while impressive for the size of the device, significantly lacks behind the other two devices. Yes, it’s more than adequate for basic web browsing, but if you want to use some of the Chrome Web Store’s more complex and power-hungry apps, it will start to struggle. You might even find some tabs are discarded without your input to make room for the resource-intensive processes. Chromebits are also unsuitable for tinkerers. They have an ARM processor so everything is soldered down, and they’re only available in one configuration with no room for extra RAM or ports. Who should buy a Chromebit? People who want an exceptionally portable version of the Chrome OS and don’t require heavy-duty computing. All the Same, Yet All Different Functionally, Chromebooks, Chromeboxes, and Chromebits are all the same. They all run Chrome OS, they all have the same OS-level restrictions, they all have access to the same app store, and they all work the same way. The distinctions between them can be made in two key areas: hardware and usage. Ultimately, the device you should buy How to Pick and Buy the Perfect Chromebook How to Pick and Buy the Perfect Chromebook Allow us to help you pick the right Chromebook for your needs.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email What does your privacy mean to you? This is a human right, so consider your response carefully. You might value it a great deal, or you might figure that it’s no big issue because you don’t do anything wrong. There’s a considerable problem if you answered the latter — and indeed the former, because while privacy might be paramount to you, it’s a commodity to a vast number of services. However much you value your privacy as a concept, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can soon put a price tag on it. And without your consent. What’s Actually Happened? During Barack Obama’s time in the White House, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that ISPs must obtain the permission of their users before selling personal data on. That bill will be repealed, pending a virtually-inevitable signature from President Trump. Image Credit: Diego Cambiaso via Flickr. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution passed by the Senate last week, and the House of Representatives approved it on 28th March 2017, meaning ISPs are just waiting for the final word from the President. The Broadband Consumer Privacy Proposal would likely have come into play by the end of this year.

Your first port of call is to inquire with your ISP. Check their Terms and Conditions: some may offer a way to opt-out. Repealing the bill leaves a lot of ambiguity in relation to Title II, Section 22 of the Communications Act. This was written in 1996 to cater for telephonic services, so it’s had to be updated to include specifications about the internet. Dallas Harris, Legal and Policy Fellow at Public Knowledge, said: “It’s just not clear what information [ISPs are] going to require an opt-in for and what information they’re going to require an opt-out for. That will all be up to the ISP to determine what they feel they need to get opt-in for as opposed to opt-out.” If they don’t, contact them and ask why not. Using a social platform like Twitter might give you some leverage, and spread the message. You’re a valued customer; they should respect your thoughts on the matter. REMINDER: Congress (WHO WE PAY) just passed a bill allowing your ISP's (WHO WE ALSO PAY) to sell your web browser history. Who wants this?!? — Brothers Osborne (@brothersosborne) March 31, 2017 Otherwise, you’re not helpless. Drastic action might mean switching to a provider who takes your privacy seriously. Numerous smaller ISPs unsuccessfully urged US Representatives to reinforce the Broadband Consumer Privacy Proposal, stating that they value your privacy. These include Gold Rush Internet, Etheric Networks, and Pacific Internet. Another option is of course to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) What Is The Definition Of A Virtual Private Network [Technology Explained] What Is The Definition Of A Virtual Private Network [Technology Explained] Read More . These encrypt all communications, so your ISP can see you’re using a VPN, but not which domains you’re visiting 6 Logless VPNs That Take Your Privacy Seriously 6 Logless VPNs That Take Your Privacy Seriously In an age where every online movement is tracked and logged, a VPN seems a logical choice.

Read More , you can rest assured that you’re doing all you can to stay private. Is There Anything Else You Can Do? Finally, it’s worth keeping an eye on Max Temkin, creator of Cards Against Humanity. Once this bill’s repealed, Temkin plans to purchase and publish the browsing histories of the congress members who voted to get rid of these privacy restrictions. It’s in an effort to show that selling browsing data works both ways; or as campaign director of Fight for the Future, Evan Greer puts it: “Congress should know by now that when you come for the Internet, the Internet comes for you.” You could also check out SearchInternetHistory, run by privacy advocate, Adam McElhaney. He’s received some flak for setting up a GoFundMe page. Nonetheless, we should still encourage anyone fighting the good fight! Does the repeal particularly bother you, or do you think it’s merely business as usual? Do you have any other tips for staying anonymous? And do you think this is indicative for the future of ISPs worldwide?

Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email * Howard A Pearce April 3, 2017 at 6:49 pm "What does your privacy mean to you? This is a human right, so consider your response carefully." The writer never tells us what this right is or where it comes from or upon what it is based. "During Barack Obama’s time in the White House, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that ISPs must obtain the permission of their users before selling personal data on." In other words the government will determine what data is personal or not - at least the writer seems to simply assume the government knows what is personal or not. The first problem with the idea is that information or data cannot be owned - unless you accept the false concept of intellectual property rights where people are allowed to own these things - like you reputation merely made up of what others believe. Since the write never tells us where privacy comes from or what it really is, I will offer a view. It comes from your right to personal property which allows you to keep data or information private to begin with -like on your computer or locked away somewhere. Imagine a world were everything is public (including property) - would there be any privacy in such a world ? If not, what conclusions can you draw from that? People only have privacy in locations that are itself private .

As we have in years past, The Washington Post is keeping tabs on all the pranks we can find (or, more often, jokes that are pitched to us by brands). We've begun our tracking of this hoax wasteland a day early to account for all the stuff that crept into March. Below is our list of all the April Fools' pranks on the internet this year, broken up into a few categories. Whether you've come here to fact check something you read online that seems a bit off, or because you just like to watch the world burn, we hope this list will be helpful over the next couple of days.

Just because it’s popular doesn’t mean it’s the best, though. Whether you’re sick of Skype Fed Up With Skype? Here Are 6 of the Best Free Alternatives Fed Up With Skype? Here Are 6 of the Best Free Alternatives Are you frustrated with Skype and searching for alternatives? One of these fantastic video chat and calling apps available on almost all platforms can help you make the switch. Read More or just want to try something new, here are the best free programs to replace Skype that you can install to your Windows PC. 1. Google Hangouts The most popular service of its kind after Skype, Hangouts can do pretty much everything Skype lets you do. Search for someone using their email address or phone number, and you can start chatting with them via text, an audio call, or a video chat. You can add groups of ten people, and your Google contacts are automatically added and organized. Using Hangouts, you can even place calls to mobile or landline phones that aren’t using the service. These are almost always free inside the U.S. and Canada but vary in other countries. If you have lots of friends who aren’t Apple users, this is a great choice for your home messenger. The only problem with Hangouts is that its official desktop version isn’t fantastic. For a while, the Chrome app Common Hangouts was the best way to use the service, but Google has killed the app — it redirects to the main Hangouts page now.

LINE LINE is another messenger that lets you easily keep up with your friends. Aside from the Windows desktop, it’s also available for all major mobile devices. As you’d expect, the service provides free video calls, voice calls, and text messaging for groups. If you’d like to jazz up your chats, you can pick from thousands of animated stickers. Most of these cost money in the LINE store, though. If you share a lot in your chats, LINE supports some media that even Skype doesn’t. You can leave someone a voice message for later, or even beam your location if needed. LINE also promotes “official accounts” of celebrities, though there’s no guarantee that your favorites are here. Watching an ad enables you to make a short international call for free. LINE has a good set of features and is worth a try if you’re looking for something a little different from the usual. 4. Tox Tox is the app to beat if you’re looking for a secure Skype alternative. It’s not headed by a corporation. Rather, it’s an open-source tool made by “people fed up with the existing options that spy on us, track us, censor us, and keep us from innovating.” You might expect such an app to feature a lousy interface or a confusing setup, but not so with Tox. Grab and install either qTox (the full-featured app) or uTox (meant for lighter systems) and start chatting. Tox is completely free and doesn’t feature any ads. Secure chats, voice calls, and video calls mean that nobody can spy on you. You can even share your screen and trade files with no limits. What’s more, Tox runs off of its user’s systems, so there are no servers for malicious folk to attack. It might be new to you, but Tox is definitely worth a look if you value privacy and freedom in your apps. 5. Viber Another classic choice in the messaging arena, Viber is available as a desktop download and a Modern app. You’ll find all the standard features inside, including group chats, video calling, and stickers.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google tweaks the Pixel C tablet to be a little… Google tweaks the Pixel C tablet to be a little more like its Pixel phones By Kyle Wiggers — April 3, 2017 9:05 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Google hasn't forgotten about the Pixel C. A recent update brings its features in line with the company's Pixel phones. The Pixel C, Google’s answer to Microsoft’s Surface and Apple’s iPad, never really caught on — a year and a half after the tablet’s launch, sales are stagnant. But fortunately for buyers who took the plunge, Google hasn’t forgotten about it. Last week, the search giant began rolling out an update, Android 7.1.2, that brings the tablet’s features in line with Google’s Pixel-branded smartphones. The multitasking menu has been tweaked slightly. Now, it’s more like the Pixel’s interface — when you switch apps, you get an animated grid-based system that shows the apps running in the background. Unfortunately, it’s limited to the eight most-used apps — unlike on the Pixel, scrolling through additional apps doesn’t appear to be possible. More: Google reaches for the stars with rumored do-it-all laptop running new “Andromeda” That’s not all that’s changed. Android 7.1.2 introduces new navigation menus close in styling to the Pixel and Pixel XL — they’re now all white, and the home button is a solid circle. The settings menu has adopted the blue color scheme of Google’s phones. And the Pixel Launcher, Google’s proprietary home screen app, now comes pre-installed with an app drawer and weather widget optimized for the tablet’s screen size. Android 7.1.2 will roll out broadly in the coming weeks. This could lay the groundwork for a broader transformation. Rumors suggested that Google is developing a new operating system, Andromeda, that will offer a hybrid Chrome OS and Android platform. A few of the rumored features include notification syncing between Android devices enhanced with machine learning — reportedly, notifications will only display on a device that’s actually in use. As recently as September 2016, two manufacturers were said to be working on Andromeda devices. Google is rumored to unveil the operating system this year, though Senior Vice President of Android and Chrome OS, Hiroshi Lockheimer, has said that the two operating systems are not merging. One of those devices could be a follow-up to the Pixel C, according to Android Police. It’s the result of a collaboration between the Pixel, Android, and Chrome OS teams, and is reportedly thinner than Apple’s MacBook Air at 10mm and 12.3 inches. A backlit keyboard’s said to house a “glass trackpad” that has force detection similar to the MacBook, and an Intel Core M3 or i5 processor reportedly powers that tablet’s operating system. Other rumored specs include 32 or 128GB of internal storage, 8 or 16GB of RAM, two USB Type-C ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a range of sensors, stylus support, stereo speakers, quad microphones, and a battery that lasts 10 hours. The device will be aimed at the enterprise market, as rumor has it. Its starting price is $800 (within striking distance of Microsoft’s $900 Surface Pro 4), and it is expected to launch sometime between April and July 2017.

Google testing ‘tags’ label in search results snippets A new Google experiment updates the search results snippets to show tags related to the page. But these tags don't seem to do much of anything. Barry Schwartz on April 3, 2017 at 12:30 pm More Google has confirmed to Search Engine Land that they are experimenting with a new feature in the search results. I happened to stumble upon a search results snippet in Google that showed “tags” within the snippet. The unusual part of this was that the “tags” didn’t offer any additional functionality. Google would list “tags” relevant to the page content in the actual search results listing snippets. You were not able to filter by those tags, click on them or anything. It just listed “tags” in the snippets without showing you anything more. Here is a screen shot: Google confirmed this was a real experiment but would not explain what they are for and how they should work.

A deep look at Google’s biggest-ever search quality crisis Under fire for months, can Google reverse the drip-drip-drip of criticism as incorrect, absurd or even dangerous results surface to the top? Danny Sullivan on April 3, 2017 at 9:00 am More The past few months have been bad for Google’s search reputation. Long considered the “gold standard” in search, Google has seen its search results questioned as never before. It’s a body blow to a core service that should be safe as Google tries to grow in new directions. Recovering from that blow isn’t easy. What’s happened to Google search is on par with the Apple Maps fiasco or Samsung’s exploding Galaxy Note7 phones. To this day, people still joke about Apple Maps being bad, even though it’s greatly improved. As for Samsung, the phones might no longer explode, but the jokes continue. Google now faces the same problem. Some of its search results are seen as laughable, embarrassing, or even dangerous. How Google lost its search groove Last November, Google found itself dragged into what had been mostly Facebook’s fake news problem when it listed a page at the top of its “In the news” section that promised the final election counts for the 2016 US presidential election. The page didn’t have the final, official, or even accurate counts. The next month, in December, Google took a huge hit after a Guardian article highlighted how, for some searches, Google was giving extremely disturbing answers. For example, here’s Google Home speaking at the time about how every woman has some degree of prostitute and evil in her: Google Home giving that horrible answer to "are women evil" on Friday. Good article on issues; I'll have more later https://t.co/EUtrx4ZFul pic.twitter.com/Ec8mEqx8Am — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) December 4, 2016 A week after that, the Guardian was back, highlighting how Google was putting a Holocaust denial site at the top of its search results for “did the holocaust happen.” That hadn’t yet been forgotten when last month, Google could be found confirming that President Barack Obama was plotting a coup: I know @ruskin147 already shared this, but here's my own Google Home informing me Obama plans a coup. pic.twitter.com/gs0s0ivF3L — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017 This was just one of several odd “featured snippets” or “one true answers” appearing at the top of Google’s results. Less than two weeks ago, Google took further flak after featuring Breitbart for a science news search: How on earth is @BreitbartNews getting the #1 slot in Google results when it comes to Science/Nature News pic.twitter.com/AIpMYrJ38b — Cody Brown (@CodyBrown) March 22, 2017 That’s not actually what happened, as I’ll come back to. Nevertheless, it doesn’t stop the “WTF, Google?” reaction. Indeed, it’s a reaction that’s happening because I’d argue Google has lost core faith with people and publications that have bought into the idea that you can Google anything and get the right answer. Google’s results might be as good as ever. They might even be better than ever. But if the public perception is that Google has a search quality problem, that wins, because we don’t have any hard figures about relevancy. We don’t have relevancy ratings for search engines We don’t know which search engine has the best search results. There’s no independent third-party diligently and consistently evaluating actual results. We occasionally get consumer satisfaction surveys, but those don’t actually try to verify that the consumers rating search engines actually know themselves how to evaluate the quality of results. Without qualified data, Google has earned its reputation as being the best search engine because early on when it started, it was easily demonstrably better than other search engines. By the time the others caught up, it was over. People stopped talking about using “search engines” and shifted over to “Googling” things, where Google was seen at the best and only serious way to get information. A 2003 New York Times column by Thomas Friedman even asked, “Is Google God?” Google’s only real challenger in recent years, Bing, was largely laughed off as competitor when it started. Bing certainly didn’t help itself by spying on Google searchers in order to copy Google’s results. By and large, Google’s results were unquestioned. Google was the best. Anyone in the search marketing space, or those who watch search closely, knew this wasn’t necessarily the case. Google had weaknesses. But we’re a niche audience that’s largely dismissed. It takes something among the “normals” out there to finally have an impact on Google’s reputation as being great. There have been only a handful of such occasions. Google’s previous search quality challenges In 2003, Google came under criticism after its results were “Googlebombed” so that in a search for “miserable failure,” the official biography for George W. Bush generally ranked first. This wasn’t a major crisis for the company, however. Indeed, Google saw it as so low in priority that took three years before a fix was put into place. A far bigger crisis was in April 2004, when the anti-Jewish “Jew Watch” site was noticed to be ranking at the top of Google for a search on “jew.” There were calls for the site to be dropped from Google’s results. But Google chose to go with a message of wanting to be inclusionary rather than censor. It quickly posted a disclaimer that appeared alongside those results, which themselves changed over time. The issue largely went away. In August 2005, Google took a brief blow when Yahoo managed to claim it had indexed more pages than Google. In a world without a universal quality score to measure search engines, size was often used as a proxy. As relatively meaningless as that number was, Google went into red-alert status to claim within about a month that it had overtaken Yahoo with a bigger index — and oh, that it now considered size so passé that it wasn’t going to cite pages indexed as a metric any longer. Google’s most serious challenge until now, in my opinion, really came on January 1, 2011. In the weeks before, there had been grumblings that “content farms” were somehow walking all over Google’s results, serving up lightweight content to answer common questions. On New Year’s Day 2011, Vivek Wadhwa published a column about why a better Google was “desperately” needed. The column was an over-the-top condemnation of Google’s search quality backed by no actual metrics. Google was clearly serving hundreds of millions of searches successfully per day, or its actual users would have been abandoning it in droves. They were not. But Wadhwa’s column resonated with tech bloggers who for various reasons just felt in their gut that Google had a problem. Google again went to red-alert status. Within two months, it launched what was called the Panda Update, a change especially meant to go after content farms and low-quality content. The normals relaxed, assuming all was fixed. Meanwhile, search marketers watched as Google rolled out nearly 30 subsequent updates over a four-year period to get a handle on the issue. Google’s current search reputation challenge All those past crises are nothing in seriousness, compared to what Google currently faces. Now, the search engine is regularly finding its search quality questioned, often with little perspective and sometimes with flat-out inaccuracies reported as fact. For example, the Guardian has done a fantastic job highlighting serious issues with Google. But that same publication also declared in December that Google was promoting right-wing bias in a systematic fashion. That’s not true. If you care to understand in detail why it was demonstrably false, see my previous explanation at the end of this story. The reality is that Google has problems that can seem to favor extreme sites of any leaning. The Guardian writers just didn’t bother to do any easy, basic checks beyond right-wing sites. Also consider that issue I mentioned earlier, where Google was spotted listing a Breitbart story first among three news items for a search on “great barrier reef.” After that was tweeted, legitimate questions were raised about whether Breitbart should be a science news source. What seemed missing was any solid examination of the problem. Instead, Gizmodo first condemned Google for serving up Brietbart for a “climate science” search, then in a follow-up declared in a headline: “Google Says Its Job Is to Promote Climate Change Conspiracy Theories.” Neither of those things were true. It’s also deeply ironic. Google’s being attacked over whether or not it’s doing a good job presenting factual information in articles that themselves that have factual problems. A fact check on Google’s alleged failure on facts A search for “great barrier reef” is not a “science” nor a “climate science” search. It’s a search for a place. Those conducting it might be interested in science information. They might be interested in tourism information. They might be interested in business information about the region. They might just want a map. Google has no way to know the exact intent of that search. That’s why it presents a variety of results, some related to tourism, some related to climate science. Those results currently include pages from three major and generally respectable news sites — CNN, The New York Times and the Guardian — saying large parts of the Great Barrier Reef are dead, or that it’s under stress but not dead, or that it’s not actually dead at all: (Those conflicting headlines all come from the same research report, which indeed says that the Great Barrier Reef has serious problems. But because some publications reacted to that initial report to say that the reef was dead, the researchers and local tour operators pushed back — which caused a spate of “it’s not dead or completely dead” stories). When people search about things, they might also want to know related news. That’s why Google has the Top Stories box. And with this search, Google faces the same issue. People searching for “great barrier reef” aren’t necessarily wanting just science news, so Google provides a variety of current news headlines. On the day this all exploded, there was fresh news about the stress the Great Barrier Reef is suffering. Breitbart had a commentary on that topic. It happened to get the first spot. It wasn’t “pinned” to that spot permanently, as the Gizmodo article suggested. It was rotated out as the news itself started to change. Nor was that news for a “science” search, as previously explained. And no, Google didn’t say the story was there because Google’s job was to promote climate change conspiracy theories. Google said it was there as a natural consequence of showing a range of news and views — which is generally what you want from a search engine. If you want to go further with me examining the issues in this particular search, see some of my commentary in this Twitter moment. But the facts don’t matter, in terms of Google’s search quality reputation. The Google outrage machine is stoked. After so many failures, I’d say many don’t care about the facts and important questions in search, including how censorship might have unwanted blowback. They just see Google screwing up again, adding to the growing public relations issue. Fix it! Google DOES have problems that need fixing Don’t get me wrong. Google deserves plenty of criticism for some of the results that it has been showing. Even when there are reasons that provide perspective, that doesn’t excuse the need for Google itself to take corrective actions. Here are some specific things it is doing and could do better. Search Suggestions / Autocomplete: Google began testing a way for people to report offensive search suggestions in February and has promised to improve those suggestions overall. But nearly two months after that limited test began, the reporting tool has yet to be rolled out broadly. Meanwhile, it’s fairly easy to find suggestions that some might find objectionable: Those are for the political parties of the Democrats and Republicans, but trust me, you can sadly find similar things about racial groups, ethnicities and sexual orientation. These will continue for as along as Google offers suggestions, which are based on actual searches that real people do in volume. Over time, perhaps they’ll be reduced. But with an infinite amount of things to search for, you can’t fix it all. Nor can Bing, by the way: Google needs to get that reporting tool out broadly as soon as possible. It needs to consider eliminating suggestions on desktop, where they aren’t as necessary as on mobile. It needs to ramp up ways to filter out offensive suggestions. It’s a problem that’s festered for six years or more. Google needs to do more. Featured snippets: Google could and perhaps should eliminate featured snippets for desktop searches, where they aren’t necessary and would encourage people to assess a variety of results rather than fixating on “one true answer” that might not be true at all. It’s much more difficult to drop featured snippets for Google Assistant and Google Home, because when they work — and they do often work — they are a distinguishing feature that puts Google ahead of Apple’s Siri and Amazon Echo’s Alexa. Google hopes a new effort announced last month involving its quality raters will make objectionable and questionable content less likely to appear. But that wouldn’t stop a site like Quora, which isn’t generally objectionable, for showing up with an entirely fake answer about the person who “invented” homework: That person isn’t real and didn’t invent homework, but because the page looks like it’s providing an answer to the question, Google elevated it. Bing did this as well, when I first noticed this last month. Bing’s since changed to using an answer from its Bing Distill community, where volunteers try to answer questions: That’s better, but it’s not a scalable solution to the overall problem. People want one fast answer for all types of topics. The more comprehensive any search engine tries to be in doing this, the more likelihood that it will make mistakes for more obscure or infrequent questions. The solution overall might be that our voice assistants have to do a better job stressing that they’re making a “best guess” and perhaps encouraging us to review other answers. It might also involve us, as searchers, doing a better job understanding that there’s not always one true answer to everything and that we need to be more critical about what we receive and do further research where it might seem needed. Search quality: Aside from presenting one answer in a special featured snippets box, Google has had problems where the top web result can be offensive or where most of the results have issues, as was the case with searches about whether the Holocaust was real. Google launched an algorithm change within a week of that problem coming to light in December. It quickly changed the results for the Holocaust search in question. That change also appears to have helped with some other problematic searches, as I’ve covered earlier. Data from quality raters may help further improve things. Still, Google almost certainly won’t be able to eliminate all objectionable results. Inevitably, someone will stumble across something that feels grossly wrong. The question then is whether that will be seen as Google failing to do enough or that Google can’t fix everything perfectly. Top Stories: The problem of fake news or dubious content appearing in Google’s “Top Stories” section is largely down to Google itself. It deliberately chose to allow publications beyond vetted news sites into this area back in October 2014. That’s why those fake election results appeared there. Changing the name of the section to “Top Stories” last December didn’t change the underlying problem. Shifting back to only allowing vetted sites won’t solve the issue of Breitbart content showing up. Breitbart is a vetted site that was admitted into Google News. The only way to keep that content out would be to ban the site from Google News entirely. Some might agree with that; others might find there’s a strong argument that a publication that’s one of the few to get a one-on-one interview with President Donald Trump deserves to be retained as a news source. Search will never be perfect In the end, it’s good that Google is going through this search quality crisis. This new pressure is forcing it to attend to issues that can no longer be allowed to fester. It’s not clear, however, if Google will be able to solve its biggest issue overall: the drip-drip-drip of criticism for problems that no search engine can ever fully eliminate, given how broad search is. Google handles 5.5 billion searches per day. Per day. Billions of searches, with around 15 percent being entirely new, never asked before. Google tries to answer these questions by producing results from billions of pages from across the web. It’s an impossible task to get perfectly right every time. Pick any search, and you can come up with something that will return objectionable or questionable results. This isn’t a new issue, as some of Google’s past search quality crises demonstrate. But possibly it’s growing, either as more questionable content flows onto the web or as more people are hyperaware of checking to see if such content surfaces in search results. An impossible task, but one where striving for perfection remains so crucial. Dylann Roof, convicted of murdering nine people in the Charleston church shooting, is an example of how important this is. Roof has said he did a Google search to learn more about “black on white crime” and that the first site he came to was a white supremacist site, which in turn may have shaped his motivation to commit the murders, as this NPR story recounts. Google no longer lists that site in the first page of its results. Bing does, at the time of this writing. I suspect that even if Google’s top results had lacked that site, Roof might have gone on searching until he found information confirming the bias he already had. Another part of his “manifesto” espousing hatred toward blacks comes from what he called his own “real life” experience, not from Google searches. But still. Getting the results as right as possible matters, however impossible that might seem. Search is hard. A big challenge for search engineers in the past was dealing with overt spam trying to attain high rankings. Now they have to grapple with “post-truth” content where pages that sound factual or informative to an algorithm can be anything but. We should continue to hold Google and search engines to a high standard and highlight where things clearly go wrong. But we should also understand that perfection isn’t going to be possible. That with imperfect search engines, we need to employ more human critical thinking skills alongside the searches we do — and that we teach those to generations to come. Life itself rarely has “one true answer” to anything. Expecting Google or any search engine to give them is a mistake.

SEO and social: 1 + 1 = 3 Columnist Eric Enge recaps a session from SMX West detailing fresh ideas for how search engine optimization (SEO) and social media marketing can work together to produce results. Eric Enge on April 3, 2017 at 10:13 am More The recent SMX West conference had many awesome sessions, and today I’m going to provide some compelling insights from “SEO and Social: A Match Made in Marketing Heaven.” One of the great things about this session is that all four speakers took a step back and provided fresh ideas on how to think about the integration of these two disciplines. Let’s dig in! Flexibility and a willingness to fail Leading off the session we had Maggie Malek, head of PR and social at MMI agency out of Houston. She walked us through a process for getting search and social to work together. If your business is like most businesses, it’s likely that various groups tend to work in silos. This is a problem for many reasons, and it’s critical to break down those silos. To make matters worse, the current landscape is a bit of a mess: Worse still, that landscape is constantly changing. One of the other big problems we all face is that consumers have a natural ad block. Success will only come if we have a willingness to create authentic conversations with people and identify moments that matter. Malek’s overall recommended process is captured in this chart: These four pillars are key to success. But equally important is having flexibility and a willingness to fail. What that means is that there is no such thing as content without value. For example, a post that gets no engagement still provides useful information. One last key point before we start walking through the process: To create a true breakthrough, you must come from a genuine place, and what that means is that you must “define your spirit” (I interpreted this as being clear on what you stand for). Step 1: Lead with data In other words, what are people searching for? Bear in mind, though, that Google is not the only place people are searching. They use Facebook Open Graph, YouTube, Amazon, Twitter, Instagram and more. Malek also recommends that you use this data from search to act as the “head” for your efforts, and that info from social act as the “heart.” Basically, search drives an analytical process, but social enables you to connect with what people want. It’s in social where you can discover things such as: What are people saying about your product to their friends? How are they interacting with your competitors? What customer service issues are they having? What type of content gets the most engagement? Step 2: Create a content strategy Some key points for this are: Plan for unbridled success. Your plan has to help us succeed, and in a big way, elsewise, why are we playing the game? Track the right metrics. We must measure our results and tune our content creation strategies over time. Pick your channels. Focus your efforts on the ones that create the best connections with you customers. Build a dynamic team based on brand needs. Step 3: Leverage relevance and context There are three major types of content: Hero content: Large-scale content that you create around major events. These are the ones where you are swinging for the fences. Hub content: Regularly scheduled push content for your prime prospects. Hygiene content: Always-on “pull” content designed for your core targets. Make sure to maintain a publication checklist, so that all the right people get involved, and never release a piece of content without proofing it first! Step 4: Ignite conversations and amplify There are four parts to this step: Assign a dedicated team. Hire the most amazing writers as brand ambassadors. Have everyone on board with data review. Be ready to move (fast when opportunities or issues demand it!). Step 5: Experiment, measure, repeat Remember the process chart above? All these processes are continuous and interacting. Along the way, look for key opportunities to amplify at a moment’s notice: High organic reach = amplify Heavy website traffic = amplify Key cultural moment = amplify Last, but not least, remember to fail fast, fail forward. Your path to success is made possible by your willingness to fail, fail often and learn from those failures as rapidly as possible. SEO and Social: A Match Made in Marketing Heaven By Maggie Malek from Search Marketing Expo – SMX Bridging the data gap with social Hannah Thorpe, director at White.net, was the second speaker. She focused on how to analyze consumer behavior on social media to gain insights into SEO. Sound intriguing? I thought so, too. This is important because over the last few years, Google has steadily made less and less data available to SEOs. First there was the big shift to “not provided,” and then the degradation of the quality of info available in Keyword Planner. You can try to fill in that info using Search Console, but that data is incomplete and inaccurate. One might guess why Google took these data sources away, and a good guess is that they prefer that publishers focus on their audience and customers (analyzing their needs and behaviors) instead of focusing on the inner workings of a search engine. Oddly enough, this turns out to be a great idea, and one place where we can get lots of data on prospect and customer behavior is social media. There is much more data available, more adoption of technologies and more cross-platform sharing. Let’s start by seeing how social can help us with the keyword problem: Clearly, there are some differences in how keywords and hashtags are used, though the data will largely be natural language-based. Nonetheless, this should still provide some great insight into terminology used by people. Next up: what content should you be creating? Social can do a great job of letting us know what content people are looking for. You can look across the major social sites, of course, but forums can also be a great source of info. As a bonus, this content will naturally be targeted to users and not robots. Last, but not least, how to you find the right people to target? Social encourages you to know your audience and who is engaging. This makes it invaluable in understanding who you need to address with your SEO efforts as well. So we may have lost much of the data we used to get directly from Google, but we can use social media to help fill the gap! Bridging The Data Gap With Social By Hannah Thorpe from Search Marketing Expo – SMX Driving performance for Avis Budget Group Next up was Chris Pinkerton, a VP at Mediative. He walked us through a case study of work his team did for the Avis Budget Group. The situation they faced is that there were more than 1 million searches per month that Avis Budget Group (ABG) was not showing up for — 40 percent of these were coming from mobile devices, with many coming from, or going to, a social site during the same session. In addition, the competitive landscape is weak at the point of social and local integration, but the customers aren’t. Pulling customers out of this “open market” was of strategic importance to ABG, and a combination of SEO and social enabled this to happen. The following chart helps illustrates how SEO and social integrate to drive the desired result: As an example, consider how keeping NAP (name, address, phone number) data up to date allows the social local ecosystem and content development work together: Mediative pursued this campaign in a broad-based way, touching across all points in the pyramid as outlined above. And what kinds of results did this drive? Let’s have a look: The campaign also drove significant organic visits from Facebook, and 7 percent of these converted into car rentals. This is an example of how search has fragmented into many platforms. Organic SEO also grew double-digit over the first year. This also drove more activity in Google My Business. For example, at Newark airport, they went from four reviews with an average rating of 2.2 to 125 total reviews with an average score of 4.6. As a result, competition is beginning to follow — but of course, ABG has the lead. The key aspect of this was a shift toward a more socially savvy audience, focusing more on local and more on mobile. SEO and Social: Driving Performance For Avis Budget Group By Chris Pinkerton from Search Marketing Expo – SMX Leveraging Twitter to show up in the Google SERPs The final presenter was Mark Traphagen, director of brand evangelism at Stone Temple Consulting. He shared data that shows how much Google indexes tweets, and what types of accounts and tweets are most likely to get indexed. One key moment in this story is the Twitter–Google deal, which was announced in February of 2015 and went live in May 2015. As part of this deal, Twitter provided Google direct access to all the information on Twitter activity via a live data feed. In principle, this provided Google with very low-effort access to that information, making it possible for the search engine to index as much information as they would care to. Stone Temple took measurements of the level of Twitter indexation prior to the announcement of the feed in January 2015, then May of 2015, and one more time in October of 2016. These data points make it possible to track Twitter indexation over time. Let’s look at the indexation of Twitter by Google over time: It’s fascinating to see that Twitter indexation peaked in the May 2015 study, and that’s shortly after the integration by Google of the Twitter data feed, but in the last measurement in October of 2016 shows that the indexation levels dropped. Why would that be? The likely explanation is that Google has thoroughly tested the best mix of factors to decide what tweets to index. It turns out that one of the big factors appears to be the number of favorites (aka likes) that a tweet gets: It turns out that favorites appear to be better correlated with indexation than retweets. Why would that be? It might be because there are so many auto-retweeting bot accounts out there (estimated to be 48 million) that a retweet proves to be quite a weak signal. The number of followers also correlates with higher indexation, and that makes sense, as people with more followers are more likely to have their tweets clicked on if they appear in the search results (people might click on a celebrity tweet). It also turns out that having a verified account is a big deal, too. We know that the concept of identity is important to Google. If you look at the data for people who have an unverified account, regardless of social authority (Note: “social authority” as used here refers to Followerwonk Social Authority), the indexation level of their tweets will probably be about 5 percent. On the other hand, with verified accounts, ones with low social authority (ranging from 0 to 39) are still only indexed at about 5 percent — but it scales up sharply from there: The essential point is that leveraging Twitter to get more shelf space in Google depends on a few things. It’s critical to have a verified account, and to build your social authority over time. Then, it’s important to create tweets that attract a lot of attention — so that others like and retweet them. For your overall strategy, this means building your own authority over time, and getting verified. If you don’t have those things now, then maybe you need to get help from someone who does. Consider finding and working with an influencer that is willing to work with you.

A guide to six front-runners in the race to automate the road. SLIDESHOW Uber (1 of 6) Waymo (2 of 6) Nissan (3 of 6) BMW (4 of 6) GM Cruise (5 of 6) Tesla (6 of 6) Editor’s Note: This is one of several stories about the future of our metropolis, which San Francisco is publishing over the next month as part of the April 2017 Urban Design Issue. To read stories as they become available online, click here. Want to see this info in handy chart form? Visit the digital version of the magazine (and click to zoom in). UBER How autonomous? The car drives, but you still need to be ready to take over. Cars on California roads in 2016: “A handful,” according to Uber. How often driver intervention was required: Not disclosed. Target release date: Not disclosed. Under the hood: To compete with established automakers and Google, Uber made deals with both Mercedes parent Daimler and Volvo. While Mercedes is using its own system to build cars for Uber’s ride-hailing program, Volvo is tapping Uber technology. Above the hood: It’s a Volvo XC90. The chatter: After the California DMV forced Uber to stop testing its cars in the state for lack of permits, its testing program decamped to Arizona last year. But Travis Kalanick just can’t quit us—in March, Uber scored a permit to test two self-driving Volvos here. WAYMO How autonomous? The car drives in all situations, except in tricky conditions like snow or unpaved roads. Cars on California roads in 2016: Not disclosed. How often driver intervention was required: Once every 5,128 miles. Target release date: 2020 Under the hood: Thanks to its Google parentage, Waymo draws on more than two million miles of data in real driving conditions. On the other hand: snow. Turns out Waymo’s cars have driven very little in challenging weather conditions. Above the hood: Designed in partnership with Honda, Waymo’s car looks like a cross between a VW Bug and WALL-E. The chatter: Now that Waymo has dragged Uber to court over allegations that Uber engineer (and ex-Googler) Anthony Levandowski stole trade secrets from Google, the two self-driving juggernauts are facing off in an expensive legal battle. Those cheering sounds you hear are probably coming from Tesla.  NISSAN How autonomous? The car drives in all situations, except in tricky conditions like snow or unpaved roads. Cars on California roads in 2016: 4 How often driver intervention was required: Once every 132.9 miles. Target release date: 2020 Under the hood: Nissan doesn’t want to eliminate drivers—just help them out a lot. When its autonomous cars run into a situation they can’t process, they ask for help from a call center staffed by actual people. Above the hood: One of the tester models is the Leaf hatchback, complete with roof mounted sensor suites. The chatter: Nissan will be among the first companies to test self-driving cars on the other side of the road when it begins a European pilot in London this year. BMW How autonomous? The car drives, but you still need to be ready to take over. Cars on California roads in 2016: 40 How often driver intervention was required: Once every 638 miles. Target release date: 2021 Under the hood: As of 2018, BMW will join the ranks of carmakers using the Intel-owned firm Mobileye, which gathers information on road hazards, weather issues, and traffic snafus and distributes it to all the automakers on its network. The more cars using it, the faster the system adapts to real-time changes on the road. Above the hood: Any old BMW 5 Series could be a tester car: All the tech is concealed in the front and rear bumpers. The chatter: Back in 1995, BMW developed autonomous technology that drove a car from Munich to Denmark and back—but cost far too much for mass production. GM CRUISE How autonomous? The car drives, but you still need to be ready to take over. Cars on California roads in 2016: 25 How often driver intervention was required: Once every 65.3 miles. Target release date: 2021 Under the hood: Since 2012, GM has been working on a “Super Cruise” system that would allow hands-off driving and braking on the highway, but it was delayed from 2016 to at least 2017. Above the hood: It’s an electric Chevy Bolt with a pair of smokestack-like sensors bolted on top. The chatter: With a $500 million stake in Lyft, GM is rumored to be readying a fleet of thousands of self-driving electric Bolts for ride-hailing in 2018. TESLA How autonomous? The car drives, but you take over for things like passing. Cars on California roads in 2016: Not disclosed. How often driver intervention was required: Once every 3.6 miles. Target release date: On sale now. Under the hood: All self-driving Teslas hook into the hive mind of the company’s autonomous software, Autopilot, which is slated to add a fully autonomous driving mode in 2018. Above the hood: You’re looking at a Model X, Model 3, or a Model S—the three models that run the Autopilot software. The chatter: Tesla drivers reportedly pay between $5,000 and $10,000 for the privilege of beta-testing Autopilot—which allegedly brakes suddenly, attempts to take wrong exits on the highway, and goes rogue on curvy roads. As one fed-up driver recently told Backchannel, “It’s like the car is trying to get into an accident.”   Originally published in the April issue of San Francisco Have feedback? Email us at letterssf@sanfranmag.com Follow us on Twitter at @sanfranmag Follow Scott Lucas on Twitter @ScottLucas86         About Us Advertise Contact Us Careers Privacy Policy Sign Up Subscribe RSS Our Publications Custom Publishing   |   © Modern Luxury   |   Terms of Service

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Leading brands are boycotting advertising services on Google’s YouTube after their ads were placed alongside content they deemed inappropriate and – even worse – were charged for the privilege. The long list includes household names such as Starbucks, Pepsi, Walmart, Tesco, the BBC and the UK government. Some have even suggested that they may have inadvertently sponsored extremist and hateful groups to the tune of more than £250,000. To understand how, it’s helpful to recall how Google services such as YouTube work. When we watch a video clip we may see ads and we often skip them. But for Google the ad is the important thing – something like 90% of its revenue comes from selling ads. When an ad is placed around a YouTube video, Google charges the advertiser and shares some of the revenue with the user who posted the video. Vloggers such as Zoella make a pretty penny from this. Google’s targeting technologies can allow advertisers to place their ads around specific types of videos or present them to specific groups of viewers. So what’s the problem? Surely it is acceptable for brands to choose which content they sponsor? Isn’t this what happens on traditional media? Given that brands can target their ads already perhaps something else is going on. Over the firewall Brands certainly have the right to demand which content their ads appear alongside. On traditional media, a brand might not want its ads placed alongside a report about a terror campaign, for example. But it is not considered acceptable for them to say that the newspaper shouldn’t report such events at all. To get around this, traditional media companies separate news and information operations from advertising operations. The problem with services like Google and other social media platforms is that such organisational firewalls don’t exist. As a result, there are potential hidden biases that can come about when advertisers insist that content matches their “company values”. Ironically enough, this problem is spelled out pretty well in a 1998 paper by Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They wrote that the “goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users”. The example they cited from a prototype version of Google saw a search for mobile phones pull up a study which went into detail about the risks of speaking on a phone while driving. They concluded that a search engine company which was taking money for mobile phone ads would struggle to justify that kind of search result to paying advertisers. Brin and Page concluded that: Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. That belief underpins why Google search separates out advertising sponsored links from organic search results. On YouTube, however, responsibility for the content of videos and the placement of ads is delegated onto viewers, users and brands through its terms of service and advertising policies. Indeed, from my analysis of 45 published cases by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority that involved YouTube, there were 44 in which YouTube responded that users, viewers and brands were responsible for the ads people saw on the service – not them. In just a single case, did YouTube accept that an ad should be taken down following a complaint to the ASA. So, one way of looking at the current boycott is that’s it’s a case of brands pushing responsibility for content and placement back onto Google/YouTube who, up to now, have been very successful in passing this responsibility onto brands and user. Weeding There is another way of looking at it, and that is as an indirect way for brands to claim more power over the type of content that people can share online. If Google has to “weed out extremist views” (as politicians such as Yvette Cooper have requested), it has to define what is extremist. Sergey Brin and Larry Page pictured in 2004. EPA/Boris Roessler The problem here is that Google’s approach to consulting with other institutions about how it operates is often spiky – as their engagement with the ASA illustrates. If they only listen to what brands want, it leaves them very susceptible to the types of insidious biases that Brin and Page spoke about in their 1998 paper: see its definition of “advertiser-friendly content”. Might they start to direct viewers towards advertising-friendly content? They could, for example, push other content down their search results and recommended video lists. So what does Google do next in the stand off with the big brands? Chief Business Officer Philip Schindler told Bloomberg that the firm has improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads. He also revealed that giant health products firm, Johnson & Johnson, has rolled back its boycott in some major markets. More broadly though, the solution is for Google to be far more transparent and engaged in the societies in which it operates. It needs to respond to brands and consumers but other social institutions as well. We all have to decide what is acceptable, not an algorithm, brands, politicians or individual YouTube viewers.

Forums Join   Frustration Mounts at Google Fiber's Slow Pace, Non-Answers by Karl Bode Monday Apr 03 2017 12:10 EDT You can add Salt Lake City residents to the growing list of would-be customers frustrated by the slow pace of Google Fiber's deployment. Locals in the city are frustrated by the sparse availability of the service more than two years after the project was first announced. The Deseret News notes that the company refuses to provide specific information on how many Salt Lake residents have service, in what order Salt Lake neighborhoods will be receiving service, or how long it will take to complete the work of establishing access to Google Fiber service citywide. Frustration has mounted not only because of Google Fiber's slow pace, but because the company hasn't been particularly clear about the direction of the project after last fall's shock announcement. Last fall Google Fiber announced it would be putting a number of new fiber deployments on hold as executives -- rumored to be tired of the high cost and slow pace of fiber installs -- ponder a pivot to next-generation, ultra-fast wireless. While this shake up involved laying off the CEO and shuffling around some employees, the company has continued to insist that existing deployments -- like Salt Lake City and Kansas City -- would remain unaffected. But in Kansas City many customers have seen their installations cancelled in recent months. And in markets like Charlotte and Salt Lake City, many people just aren't sure if service will ever actually reach them. While some of this is due to the traditionally-slow pace of digging and installing fiber, in many of these markets there are clear signs that work has been intentionally slowed as Google ponders its wireless pivot. But Google Fiber has refused to acknowledge this, only fueling consumer annoyance. For its part, Google Fiber's response has been to issue a series of rosy press statements that profess continued dedication to the project, but don't really provide any meaningful answers. "We started Google Fiber to make the Internet better," Google Fiber said in a statement. "Our super fast service is currently available to subscribers in 9 metropolitan areas, with 3 more under construction or planned. Demand for Fiber speed continues to grow, as more consumers move toward over-the-top streaming and skinny TV offerings."The reticence of Google Fiber to provide more detail likely stems from the fact that Alphabet/Google executives aren't sure themselves what happens next. The company is conducting a large number of trials using a wide variety of technologies and spectrum, and pretty clearly wants to better understand what these wireless options can do -- before insisting them a lateral replacement for the traditional fiber many execs clearly are drifting away from. tags: competition · business · alternatives · bandwidth · consumers · Google Fiber · gigabit News Jump Comcast to Reveal Details on Wireless Service on ThursdayThe FCC Quietly Begins Killing Charter Merger Conditions»Frustration Mounts at Google Fiber's Slow Pace, Non-AnswersAT&T, Comcast Insist They Love & Respect Consumer PrivacyMonday Morning Links Forum Topic: New Verizon FiOS Hardware Appears on FCC WebsiteCongress Privacy Vote Opens Door to More Government SurveillanceMinnesota Passes New Privacy Rules in Wake of Congress Vote1 in 8 Homes Now Have Broadband But No CableVerizon to Launch Live Streaming Video Service This Summer----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 43 comments michieru Premium Member join:2009-07-25 Miami, FL·Xfinity michieru Premium Member Yesterday 1:35 pm Google, stop it.

Search engines want to show the world your content, but not if you've made mistakes that undermine the user experience and search engines' guidelines. So give the search engines what they want by avoiding the following common mistakes that content creators make. 1. Short Content Google likes long-form content because it gives searchers enough information to satisfy their needs. Generally, the more in-depth the content is, the more likely it solves the searcher's intent or question, and that is what Google wants. A SerpIQ study found that content shown in Google search results in positions 1-3 had around 2,400 words, on average. In short, long-form content ranked better in Google. Does this mean you should be writing long for the sake of long? No, but you do want to make sure your content is comprehensive enough to answer searchers' questions. A good approach for each piece of content you plan to produce is to determine the main keyword phrase. Then google that phrase to see how long the content is in the top 3 search results. Make sure your own content is longer, more in-depth, more concise, and more well-thought-out. If you do, readers as well as Google will think more highly of your content. 2. No Imagery or Design Elements No one likes stale websites that look like they were put up in 1999; new, modern-looking websites simply perform better. Content is the same: If you have pages of text with no imagery or design elements, then readers—and therefore Google—will not favor your content over your competitors'. Design elements that break up text keeps readers on the page longer. The longer they are on the page, the more likely Google will boost the content's rank due to dwell time. Basically, the assumption is that the longer they are on the page, the more likely it's meeting their needs, which means a better chance to be shared on social media, linked to, or be visited again. 3. Misspellings/Content Errors Misspellings and other content errors are not, technically, SEO factors, but they hurt your credibility and your chance to be linked to. Acquiring links is one of the best ways to get content to the top of the search results. If you want to know more, Google's Matt Cutts discusses the issue here. 4. No Content Breaks The average reader's attention span is very short—shorter than even than that of a goldfish, apparently. Hence the importance of recapturing the reader's attention continuously, throughout an article. To do that, break up the text. Using subheads, lists, and images to break up the content will keep the readers reading and on the page, which, again, will help with getting the content noticed by search engines. 5. Using Long Paragraphs of Text Similarly, using long paragraphs is a good way to get your readers to leave immediately from your page. The shorter your paragraphs, the better you can get, and keep, the attention of readers—and keep them reading. Pauline from Twelveskip.com has written a good piece on the benefits of shorter paragraphs: 6. No Outbound Links Readers want credible content. If your content is merely you doing the "talking" and does not link out to other content (to cite sources, for example), why would the readers find it credible or want to link to you? Google also recognizes this. A few SEO experiments have discovered that pages with outbound links generally do better in the search process. Is that because content that has outbound links is just generally better, more well-researched content? Absolutely! Reboot Online did an experiment to see whether outbound links improve ranking in organic search results, and found that they do make an impact. The experiment couldn't determine how big the impact was, but there was an impact nonetheless. 7. No Promotion Just because you create content and make it better than everyone else's does not mean it will go instantly to No. 1. There is a reason SEO takes a while. You have to wait for people to come to your content and give it positive SEO-ranking signals, such as links and social shares. Those ranking factors could take hours, days, months, or even years. However, if you promote your content, you can get it to the right eyeballs quicker... and so get the ranking signals quicker. Having a solid promotion strategy is key. (Check out this article of mine on how to promote content via social media.) 8. No Meta Optimization and CTAs Another mistake is using the default options for your content's meta information—titles and descriptions. This may be the last of the SEO mistakes I've listed, but it's important; you can, and should, optimize the content title and description; otherwise, Google will use your header and the first two sentences, by default. Instead, write unique meta titles and descriptions for each of your content. In WordPress, for example, it's easy to do by using the Yoast SEO plugin—or others. You also want to grab people's attention with calls to action (CTAs) in the meta information. If you can grab the searchers' attention when they see your content in search results, they are more likely to click on it. And clickthrough rate is one of the largest ranking factors, according to Searchmetrics' 2015 Ranking factor study. Conclusion If you look out for these eight common mistakes, and make sure you avoid them, you will be much more successful with organic search traffic to your content. And not coincidentally, you will also be creating some solid content, which will help bring you additional traffic due to positive word-of-mouth and various other channels.

Google Map Maker is officially dead Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 8:46am PDTApr 2, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Google News Google Map Maker was introduced back in 2008, as a way for users to make contributions to Google Maps. Features like roads, highways, rivers, and so on could be added to Maps, and users could fill in details about businesses and other specific locations. After some vandalism occurred thanks to Google's poor moderation, the feature was removed entirely, and re-appeared later with less functionality. Google has been working to integrate Map Maker features into Google Maps itself, and announced in November that the independent Map Maker service would shut down. Now Map Maker is officially dead. Google's support page says that most of Map Maker's functionality is already in Maps, and the company will continue to add new features as time goes on.

Leo Herzog There is no "Suggest an edit" on a polygon like a campus border. 😆😄 Don't have my phone handy... but on desktop you can right click anywhere and "Add a missing place" Leo Herzog I don't really want to add a missing place though... 😆😄 Well, if you want to edit something that already exists, like the polygon of a campus or park, that polygon should have a label that you can click on to suggest an edit. Leonardo Baez Sadly in my country is blocked. There are several errors in street names, and some streets have changed circulation direction. Randroid Try using the "Feedback" button in Maps.

Randroid Actually it's not, it's just done differently. You have to suggest an edit, then your edit is approved or denied. I've done it multiple times within the Maps Android app. Rob Cook The best part is when they deny your edit for being inaccurate and you have to submit a photo to prove your right. caruso81 What does this do to making custom points of interest and uploading to your GPS? (I'm aware GPS units are dead and the mobile phone is the way to go. I'm also aware that US carrier data in Europe is obscenely priced and that I already own a GPS with hundreds of custom POIs loaded onto it.) IVBela What if I want to mark duplicate places? Oh nevermind... Randroid You use the "Feedback" button in Maps Leonardo Baez this is buls*** There are many countries were the only source for trusted information is the comunity. With this change now we cannot change street names, street directions, allowed and prohibited turns, add returns or new road crosses. This is buls*** google. When in hell will you designate a team to do maps of bolivia, or agola or suriname? We the users are the contributors because no one else gives tools or trusted maps as google. And now all the maps will be frozen in time circa 2015 (because for many countries google stopped edits in 2015). I'm mad as hell TannoV If you'd actually read the article, you'd have read that the functionality has been integrated into Google maps. Tomáš Petrík And if you'd actually tried that, you'd have found out that you can only add/edit places like businesses and other POIs. However, it is not possible to rename a street, edit directions and/or turns, etc. modeless And if *you'd* actually tried that, you would have seen that as a Local Guide it is possible to rename a street, edit segment attributes and also report missing roads. Martin I am a local guide, but I can't find how you rename a street. Could you point me in the right direction? Or are you supposed to use the Feedback function? Leonardo Baez I'm local guide level 5 living in Bolivia. Its not possible here roberto.elena Re editing directions and/or turns: There is a workaround for this. I've used it several times, because Map Maker was never available in Spain (one of the 20 or so countries out of 200 that wasn't lucky enough). What you do is set a route between 2 points that pass through that street or a make that turn you want to edit, and then use the feedback tool to report where the problem is. As I said, I've used it several times to correct illegal turns. Leonardo Baez Yeah... But no. You can only add places (business, comerce,etc) I dont know if in the US is avaible the full ediriong options butnoutside the US it is not. Upvotes4Bird Thanks to Google's poor moderation? Thanks to shitty users. poop. It was both. Grey Map Maker had a piece of shit moderation community with bullshit, "what we want" rules. Trying to correct an issue is a nightmare. Trying to add something is a nightmare. No way to add building corrections after the vandalism. Trying to add a path that goes by a road is not allowed sometimes - despite tons of these paths existing. And they use Google Street View - despite Google Street View being quite a bit off the ground and giving a warped perspective. I love the idea behind Map Maker, I hate the moderation community and their stupid idea of rules. poop. It's still like this even with the "new" system Grey That is awful news Randroid Unfortunately, without these kinds of rules we get things like what happened in the vandalism instance. Grey They can allow proper trail mapping without it being vandalism. They don't want trails to be used for sidewalks, so if a trail goes near a road sometimes they'll argue it's a sidewalk. But sometimes it's not! And fuck you if you want to discuss it. jdrch Google killed another product users were relying on? No way! Stop the presses! Unheard of! Adrianus AJ Nadeak Map Maker was not working in one country used to live in. I did manage to name a street using Map Maker years ago but then it stopped working. With the country's frantic construction rate, many new roads have been built or redirected and as a result, Google Maps isn't as accurate as my current location. Many roundabouts have been converted to traffic signal intersections and a section of a new ring road is non existent. POI and places can be edited and added within the Maps app so that's not much of an issue. Janet Scott Again bad performance by Google. it's usage mistake by Google again.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Google: Please Don't Look at Our Very Tiny Ad Problem Libby WatsonYesterday 12:20pm Filed to: Google Advertising YouTube 59 4 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Philipp Schindler, left, in 2010 (Image: Getty) It’s been a tough few weeks for Google. Several companies have pulled their ads from its network after various news outlets revealed that those ads have appeared on extremist, racist, or otherwise offensive videos. But never fear. A Google executive says the problem is, actually, small. And not just very small, in fact. Not even very, very small. But very, very, very small. Advertisement In a new interview with Recode, Google’s chief business officer, Philip Schindler, downplayed the seriousness of the problem: “It has always been a small problem,” with “very very very small numbers” of ads running against videos that aren’t “brand- safe,” says Google’s chief business officer, Philipp Schindler. “And over the last few weeks, someone has decided to put a bit more of a spotlight on the problem.” Schindler specifically claimed the “error rates”—as in the number of ads appearing on offensive videos—“are tiny, tiny.” A Google spokesperson later told Recode: “When we spoke with many of our top brand advertisers, it was clear that the videos they had flagged received less than 1/1000th of a percent of the advertisers’ total impressions.” Advertisement But those videos, even if they were 0.001 percent of advertisers’ impressions, caused huge problems for Google—and threatened its massive revenue stream. Several outlets, including the UK Times and the Wall Street Journal, published evidence of ads appearing on racist, anti-Semitic, and extremist videos over the past few weeks, which led to several huge companies pulling their ads, including AT&T and Walmart. This doesn’t exactly seem like a “small problem,” and that much is clear from Google’s response—it announced changes to its policies to allow advertisers more control over where its ads appear, and recently promised to train its AI to better detect content that a brand wouldn’t want its ads anywhere near. But judging by Schindler’s comments, it seems like Google is primarily concerned not with the problem itself, but rather that people are paying attention. Saying that “someone,” i.e. several news outlets, has “decided to put a bit more of a spotlight on the problem” really makes it sound like Google is a lot more troubled by the criticism than the problem itself. Schindler even went on to say that the “problem comes from the fact that somebody is aggressively putting it onto the front page.” Ah, yes. The “problem” for Google is less the overlap of Good brands and Bad videos, and more the annoying fact that people keep talking about it. How pesky.

Google apologized for last month and now Google’s chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, opened up to Recode about the issue. “It has always been a small problem,” Schindler said, noting that the only change is that it hasn’t been pointed out, until now. Although, he also said that the company is improving software to track down five times as many videos to keep clear from advertisers. YouTube is working on decreasing response times when a video is flagged as inappropriate. Read: YouTube Advertising Issues: Google Apologizes For Putting Ads On Offensive Content While noting that the problem was small to begin with, he tried not to make it seem unimportant but said, “The problem comes from the fact that somebody is aggressively putting it onto the front page.” Essentially he said the only difference between now and the past is that now it’s being talked about, not that it’s happening any more frequently. Advertisers aren’t happy about this new attention, Schindler said, it’s that attention that’s caused advertisers like AT&T, Nestle and Johnson & Johnson to pull their ads. But the challenge for Google is in the details. It’s tricky to block certain videos because of only the language or content, certain language can be used in an extreme way in one video, but not in another. So a blanket ban would also result in a loss of potentially safe videos. Google previously said in a statement that it would be give advertisers more tools to control where their ads appeared and would be changing default settings. Google told Recode it hopes this helps bring some advertisers back to Google.

You can download backup of all your Google Keep notes. You will be able to download your Google Keep notes as HTML files (one HTML file for one note). To export Google Keep notes to PC, you have to take the help of Google Takeout feature. Its pretty easy to do that, and I have detailed the steps here. The screenshot added below shows all my Google Keep notes exported to PC. Here you can see HTML files of those notes. Apart from HTML files, there can be files with some other extension type. This is for notes that you have added to Google Keep as to-do list, notes containing labels, and notes imported to Google Keep from somewhere else. So to use those files, you have to manually change their extension to “.html”. Sponsored Links Open any HTML file and you will see that the file contains your note as it is. How To Export Google Keep Notes To PC? Step 1: Login to your Google account. Step 2: Access My Account section of your Google services. You can use this link to access My Account section. Step 3: In My Account section, you will see multiple options. Find and tap on “Control your content” option. It will be available under “Personal info & privacy” menu. Step 4: Now you will have to sign in, if you haven’t already. Step 5: Under Control your content section, you will see CREATE ARCHIVE option. Use that option. Step 6: Now you have to select the services for which you want to take the backup. By default, all services are selected. That means you can take the backup of Google Photos, Calendar, Chrome, etc). We need to export Google Keep note, so use Select none button. This will uncheck all the services. Step 7: Scroll down the list and access Keep. Now you need to enable the select option for this service. After that, click the Next button. Step 8: Now customize the zip archive that will contain the notes of your Google Keep account. In customization, you can select the File type (ZIP, TGZ, or TBZ) and Archive size (1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 10GB, or 50GB). You should also select delivery method as “Send download link via email“. This is needed to receive the download link of archive when the backup is completed. After that, you can click the Create archive button. Step 9: Now you will be able to see the process of generating the archive. If the archive is too large, then you can close the window and wait till the confirmation message is received in your email address. If the archive is small, then you will get download option quickly. Use the download button and then you can save the archive of your Google Keep notes. Extract the downloaded archive and you can see HTML and other files associated with your Google Keep notes. The Verdict: Google has also provided an option to add Google Keep notes to Google Docs and vice-versa. You can use that option if you want to export Google Keep notes as an online backup. Otherwise, if you want to have an offline backup of your notes, then this method to export Google Keep notes to PC will be helpful.

Google is the leading search engine in the world, and almost every site targets to rank high in its search results. However, there are things that will hurt your rankings, i.e. Google manual penalties. These penalties are intended to help Google fight spam, and you usually receive a notification telling you that there is an issue with your web resource. If you do receive a manual penalty from Google, then there are the 5 key steps you can take to have it removed. 1. Assess Your Site Assess your site for backlinks. You can use Google Webmaster tools or third party tools to help you identify which sites are linking to your website. You should actually use more than one tool to do this, as they can miss some links. Once you have identified all backlinks, you need to organize them into a spreadsheet or whichever format you choose. Keeping your links organized means that step two is easier to achieve. 2. Assess Your Backlinks Once you have your list of links, you can begin to assess them to determine their quality. There are tools that can help you classify links into categories - good and bad. You can use these tools to give you a starting point, but as you need to be extremely thorough, you should take time to manually assess each link. You will need to classify them as natural, unnatural and suspicious. All links that come from directories or article farms are unnatural, but links that are irrelevant to your business and industry should be considered for removal as well. 3. Contact Once you have assessed the links and decided which ones need to be removed and which can be left untouched, you need to contact webmasters of those sites. You can make an email template to ask the webmaster to remove the link to your site or change any suspicious one to ‘no-follow’. Making an email template or choosing a ready-made one from TemplateMonster will make this process a little smoother and faster. Keep a record of who you’ve emailed and when. Be prepared that some sites, particularly the directories and article farms, may take much longer than others to respond or you might want to contact them again. If a webmaster responds and says that the links have been removed, always make sure that you manually check that this is true. 4. Disavow There are a few reasons why you may not be able to change or remove links. You may not get any response from a webmaster or the site may no longer be operational. In these cases, you should use Google disavow tool. It allows you to upload a text file containing all sites and pages that you want Google to ignore when they assess your backlinks. For sites that you know are toxic, you should consider disavowing the whole domain, and not just specific pages. 5. Reconsideration Once you’ve completed the first four steps, you can ask Google to re-assess your site. This can be done through the webmaster tools, and you should outline what steps you’ve taken to fix the problem and explain what steps you will take in the future to build natural backlinks. According to Heather Corners, an SEO expert from SEO Vancouver, it can take some time before you get a response, and you might have to ask for reconsideration more than once. It can take four to six weeks for Google to check your site as this must be done manually. via GIPHY Final Thoughts One of the most important things in removing a Google manual penalty is persistence. Your reconsideration request might be refused, or Google may need you to take further action. In which case you should go back to step one and start over. Some sites prefer to hire a professional to remove Google manual penalty. This can be a good idea, as professional teams have much more experience, skill, and understanding on how to get your site within Google’s guidelines and have the penalty removed.

That’s the key takeaway from a new report that finds Ford—yes, the Detroit-based, 113-year-old giant—is winning the race to build the self-driving car, with General Motors running a close second. Renault-Nissan, Daimler, and Volkswagen round out the top five. Meanwhile, Waymo—aka Google’s driverless car effort—sits in sixth place, with Tesla in twelfth. Uber languishes in sixteenth, behind Honda and barely ahead of startup Nutonomy and China’s Baidu. That may sound all kinds of wrong to anyone who has seen Uber, Waymo, and Tesla flaunt their tech, and regards Detroit’s old guard as ill-prepared for the robotic future. But it’s the state of the race according to Navigant Research, whose newly released “leaderboard” report ranks these players not just on their ability to make a car drive itself, but on their ability to bring that car to the mass market. “The technology is great, but unless you can build tens of thousands of cars and get people in those cars, it’s not really all that useful,” says Navigant’s Sam Abuelsamid, who wrote the report with David Alexander and Lisa Jerram. The report selected the 18 biggest companies pursuing fully driverless cars, and ranked them based on nine criteria, including tech, go-to-market strategy, production prowess, staying power, and sales, marketing, and distribution. Navigant Research Ford and GM both score in the low to mid 80s on the technology front; it’s their old-school skills that float them to first and second place. They’ve each spent more than a century developing, testing, producing, marketing, distributing, and selling cars. Plus, each has made strategic moves to bolster weak points. Ford just dumped a billion dollars into an artificial intelligence outfit. It acquired ride-sharing service Chariot and invested in Velodyne, a company producing lidar, the laser scanning tech many argue is necessary for self-driving cars. GM scooped up self-driving expertise via a startup called Cruise, and partnered with Lyft to put the eventual result on the road. Waymo, by comparison, scores top marks for technology but drags in the production strategy and sales, marketing, and distribution buckets. The company plans to work with legacy automakers to put its tech in cars, but has not yet struck any major deals. “They have almost every piece of this—except the product strategy,” says Abuelsamid.

In fact, its key strength—that it already operates a global fleet of shared vehicles—may not be enough here. “It’s a lot easier for the company that actually has the infrastructure to create vehicles to recreate what Uber’s done, than the other way around,” Abuelsamid says.

It’s strong on “vision” (that’s Elon Musk for you) and go-to-market strategy (it’s already offering semi-autonomous cars). But Navigant knocks Tesla on staying power (it’s a young player in a brutal industry), sales, marketing, and distribution (Tesla can’t operate in every state), and technology (because Musk won’t use the expensive lidar tech experts say is necessary for full autonomy). Now, this report comes with a whopper of a caveat: These are early days in a race that will unfold over years, if not decades. Every company listed could shore up its weaknesses with smart partnerships or acquisitions, and jump to the front of the pack.

Ron Amadeo - Apr 3, 2017 3:55 pm UTC Enlarge reader comments 21 Share this story Google has shut down Google Map Maker. A support page went up over the weekend declaring that Map Maker is closed but that "many of its features are being integrated into Google Maps." Map Maker was a Wikipedia-style Map editing service that launched in 2008. The site created a sandbox version of Google Maps and gave users powerful editing tools, allowing them to build roads, terrain, landmarks, and buildings from scratch. The edits were sent to a moderation queue, and if the community members deemed the edits to be correct, they were pushed to the production version of Google Maps. While Google notes that it has "started to graduate functionality from Map Maker to Google Maps on both desktop and mobile," for now there is a huge functionality gap between Google Maps and Map Maker. Maps has several "editing" features to change existing content but none of the "build it from scratch" features of Map Maker. While the map creation tools were great for new construction and creating more detailed maps, Map Maker was most valuable in countries that didn't have great maps to begin with. Check out Google Map Maker's old YouTube page, which has several time lapse videos of people in countries like India creating detailed local maps from basically nothing. Google Map Maker users even virtually infiltrated North Korea using satellite imagery and other photos to map out landmarks, roads, and gulags in the secretive country. It seems "Mapping the rest of the world" was the primary purpose of Map Maker. It was one of the few Google products to not debut in the US, only arriving in Google's home country a whopping three years after launch. One of the more famous malicious edits from 2015. Like Wikipedia, Map Maker has had its share of problems sorting out correct, well-meaning edits from malicious ones. In 2015, the service was temporarily shut down due to vandalism. During the shutdown, Google said that the current moderation process was overloaded, noting that "every edit you make is essentially going to a backlog that is growing very fast." Further ReadingGoogle temporarily shuts down Map Maker due to vandalismIt seems moderation is still a primary concern with Maps edits. For the new editing features that have been integrated into Google Maps, Google's new strategy appears to be limit the more advanced editing features to more active users. The "Google Local Guides" program awards Google Maps users points for leaving reviews and adding pictures, and various levels in the program unlock new perks from Google. Last month, Google Maps gained the ability to edit road segments—a feature of Map Maker—but rather than roll it out to everyone, it was limited to Local Guides that were "Level 3" and above. Fewer editors means a smaller moderation queue. And in the road editing announcement post, Google promised that it was "continuing to develop great moderation experiences." In the meantime, lots of Google Maps competitors still have publically available editing tools. OpenStreetMap launched four years before Map Maker, and it's probably where Google got the idea. Here Maps has a map editor, too. Neither really compares to the ubiquitous Google Maps, though, especially when it comes to the all-important smartphone app. The world has not finished changing and being mapped, so hopefully Google Map's editing tools come back in some form soon.

Search engine giant Google said that it has paid £36.4m in corporation tax in the UK for the 12 months ending June 2016. According to its annual reports, the company earned a revenue of £1.03bn and a pre-tax profit of £149m during that period. Last year, Google came under fire after its £130m tax settlement with UK authorities. The politicians in the opposition raised concerns over the way the government dealt with the case. A Google spokesperson was quoted Bloomberg as saying: “As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. “We have recently announced significant new investment in the U.K., including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff.” In February 2016, a UK parliamentary committee accused Google of being “disingenuous” with respect to its handling of international tax rules. Total employee costs at Google UK dropped by 12% to £541.2m in the last fiscal year ending June 2016, compared to £616.8m compared to the previous 18-month period. However, the headcount of the Google’s UK subsidiary increased by 26% to 2,943, while the annual employee salary stood at £183,897 on average. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said that the latest numbers of Google showed that it is not paying a fair share to the exchequer. McDonnell said: “It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36m in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. “And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year’s scandal.” READ MORE: HMRC investigates UK celeb tax profit made on empty data centres In November last year, Google confirmed that it will invest £1bn to build a new headquarters in London.

Currently, Google employs nearly 4,000 people in the UK. Tags Google Homepage News List Previous ArticleWhat is troubleshooting?

Apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other. (Dreamstime/TNS) Odds are, you’ve at least heard of Venmo, but there’s also a good chance you haven’t used the mobile app or anything else like it to send money to family or friends. But that’s likely to change over the next few years, as banks, payment companies and even the likes of Google and Facebook push so-called peer-to-peer, or p2p, payment systems — a medium of exchange with revolutionary potential. The apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other, and they even could make inroads at the cash register and with businesses that send refunds and other payments to their customers. Advertisement Continue reading These systems will get a boost later this year when a coalition of the nation’s biggest banks roll out Zelle, a mobile and online money-transfer network that will let any customer of nearly every U.S. bank send money to customers of any other bank using only a phone number or email address. Analysts say the bank-led system — and the related marketing push — should bring online and mobile peer-to-peer payments to a larger audience. Even competitors, notably the popular money transfer app Venmo, say the Zelle rollout could boost their fortunes by making digital-money transfers more mainstream. “We don’t see it as a winner-take-all scenario,” said Josh Criscoe, a spokesman for Venmo owner PayPal. “We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash.” Online and mobile peer-to-peer payment systems have grown rapidly over the last few years, and analysts expect that to continue. In a report published in March, finance industry research firm Aite Group estimated that Americans made about $147 billion in digital p2p transfers last year, up from $100 billion the year before. Those are big numbers, to be sure, but last year’s sum still only accounted for about 12 percent of the more than $1.2 trillion that Americans paid each other that year, mostly in cash. That means there’s still plenty of growth ahead, said Talie Baker, an analyst at Aite Group. In her report, she estimated that the volume of digital p2p payments will more than double by 2020, topping $316 billion. “Not that many consumers are using mobile payments yet,” Baker said, noting that though these payments are more common among young consumers in big coastal cities, they’re not so ubiquitous elsewhere. “I’m a Gen-X person and I live in Denver — I hadn’t heard of Venmo until 2015.” There are plenty of players in the p2p game. Advertisement Continue reading Square Inc., the payments company behind the tiny white credit card reader that plugs into a smartphone, has a p2p service of its own, Square Cash, which launched in 2013. Following the geometric theme, there’s also Circle, a Boston firm that started the same year and specializes in cross-border p2p transfers in dollars, euros and British pounds. Facebook and Google, too, allow users to send money to friends. Google has Google Wallet, which started as a mobile wallet app but became a p2p payment tool in 2015, and Facebook users have been able to send money through Facebook Messenger since 2015. Square, Google and Facebook don’t report the volume of payments made through their p2p systems, but Facebook in regulatory filings has said that only “a relatively small percentage” of its users have used the payments feature. Venmo is arguably the biggest name in peer-to-peer transfers. It even has the coveted status, like Google, Uber and a few others, of becoming a verb — as in “Venmo me.” Founded in 2009, the company was acquired in 2012 by payment services provider Braintree, which was acquired the following year by online payments giant PayPal — which offers p2p payments under its own name too. But the biggest players in the market are still the banks. Last year, Venmo users transferred $17.6 billion. That’s more than double the volume from 2015, but it’s also much less than the $28 billion transferred in 2016 through QuickPay, JPMorgan Chase’s peer-to-peer payment system. And that’s just one bank. Advertisement Continue reading Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other major financial institutions have had their own p2p transfer programs for years, though it can sometimes be clunky for bank customers to send money to people with accounts at other financial institutions. Aite Group estimates that of all the digital p2p transfers Americans made last year, non-bank systems such as Venmo accounted for only about 17 percent of that. Banks accounted for the rest, though much of that likely was made through banks’ websites, not mobile apps, and much of it was money transferred between customers of the same bank. In part, that’s a statement about who uses different systems, and what they are used for. Venmo and other non-bank systems are accessed about twice as often as bank systems, but for much smaller transactions, according to Aite Group. The average money transfer on a non-bank system is $135; the average for bank systems is $1,359, according to the report. That might suggest that parents sending money to a student for college tuition, for instance, might be more likely to transfer money through a bank, while students are much more likely to split a restaurant bill or bar tab using Venmo. The payment app is also a social network in its own right, with users sending messages to friends when they transfer money — a feature Venmo pioneered. Those messages shed light on what’s behind each transaction and indicate that Venmo is most often used among friends over food and drink, said Criscoe, the Venmo spokesman. “Pizza is the No. 1 emoji on Venmo; beer is a close follow,” he said, adding that other messages suggest users are splitting bigger-ticket items too, such as rent. Though Venmo and other non-bank payment systems are still a small part of the p2p market, banks want to make sure they keep their place in the financial order and keep their customers. This summer, Early Warning, a company owned by some of the nation’s largest banks, will release Zelle, a payment system built to compete with Venmo and others — and, banks hope, to make digital p2p payments more mainstream. Advertisement Continue reading Along with the release, Early Warning will kick off a marketing campaign showing not only how Zelle works but how it might be used. Lou Anne Alexander, president of Early Warning’s payments group, said the focus will be on appealing to older consumers who might not have tried p2p payments. “We’re trying to take (p2p) from millennials to the mainstream–customers might use a product like this,” Alexander said. “That might be managing contributions to the high school marching band or it might be renting a home on the beach with friends or family.” Zelle traces it roots back to 2011, when Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase set out to build a system — initially called ClearXchange — that would allow their customers to send money to each other using only phone numbers and email addresses. Before, customers could only transfer money to friends and family by entering account and routing numbers — information customers often didn’t know and might be concerned about sharing. Zelle is essentially a souped-up, rebranded version of ClearXchange. It will be available to anyone with a U.S. bank account, and it aims to overcome some of the limitations and confusion around the ClearXchange system. Sarah Grotta of research and consulting firm Mercator Advisory Group said banks didn’t do a great job of explaining that ClearXchange would allow customers to send money to customers of other banks. Part of the problem, she said, was that every bank has its own name for its ClearXchange-powered p2p system, including Chase QuickPay, Wells Fargo SurePay and Capital One P2P Payments. “It wasn’t well-marketed that someone at Chase could pay someone at Bank of America because they had different marketing and different branding,” Grotta said. “You could pay someone at any financial institution, but people never realized that.” To address that problem, banks over the next few months will begin rebranding their p2p transfer systems to include Zelle in the name. Chase, for instance, will start calling its system “QuickPay with Zelle.” Customers of more than a dozen big banks — representing most U.S. account holders — will be able to transfer money through the banks’ mobile apps. For other banks and credit unions, customers will be able to do so through the Zelle mobile app, set to be released this summer. Advertisement Continue reading Once the system is running and the marketing campaign kicks off, Grotta expects Zelle to be a hit. “This is going to be a much better user experience than the banks had before,” she said. “I think it will start to catch on once people see that they can in fact send money to another person at another financial institution.” For banks, the stakes are high. Though Venmo and other money transfer apps are tiny by comparison, Baker said banks are rightfully worried about what might happen if their customers interact more often with outside payment companies. If a customer opens an outside p2p payment app once a day and their mobile banking app just once a week, the payment company has more opportunities to sell that customer on products and services the bank would otherwise provide, she said. “Once Venmo builds up a strong enough customer base, then it can say, ‘Hey, come get a credit card from us,’ or ‘Come get a home loan from us,'” Baker said. “That’s the approach some providers are hoping to take.” Banks see other advantages too. Mary Harman, an executive in Bank of America’s consumer payments division, said it’s expensive for banks to process checks and move cash around, so an increase in digital p2p payments could cut costs. She said banks also want to give customers the services and options they want. Some customers, she said, might prefer using Venmo; others might prefer the implied security of managing financial transactions exclusively through their bank. “We serve 65-million households in the U.S., and not everyone will act the same way,” Harman said.

(Public Domain) Join us on the new C-Pop podcast where Taylor and Jessilyn discuss, debate and sometimes deride pop culture with a strong sense of humor and a focus on Christ. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com. No, Google Translate does not have the spiritual gift of divine interpretation. As an April Fools' joke, Christian Post wrote an article claiming the internet translator could let you know exactly what you're saying when praying in tongues. "We are thrilled that we have finally been able to assist Christian users of our software to hear from God more effectively," Paul N. Korenth, a Google software engineer, said, CP wrote. The story continued:  According to TechInsider magazine, this new feature is reportedly so sensitive and advanced that when the consumers click the audio button on Google Translate to listen to the interpretation of their tongue, a clanging cymbal or noisy gong sound will be heard if their written utterance does not comport with the spirit of 1 Corinthians 13. To marry the technological and theological, Google sought the advice and counsel of several Pentecostal pastors. "This is a huge technological and spiritual breakthrough, and we are grateful for the helpful consultation we received from theologians and church leaders across the country," he added. Yet Korenth suggested that users might run into a few snafus." While we are confident in these new language listings, it was a mystery at times discerning the Spirit and navigating the challenge of ever-changing algorithms" he said in the press release. "We at Google ask for your grace as we troubleshoot these issues," adding that the team was on one accord on the release date. For those who cared to check Christian Post's sources, they were Rick Rolled and sent to a link about April Fools' pranks. Leaders are readers! Subscribe now and get 3 magazines for the price of 1.

Check out the latest theme park experiences and attractions Brinkmann on Business Covering the business landscape in Central Florida Business Paul Brinkmann on Business Twitter, Facebook targeted by more Pulse shooting victims Families of Pulse victims sue Facebook, Twitter, and Google Families of three Pulse nightclub victims are suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google, alleging that the companies did not do enough to stop the so-called Islamic State to post propaganda and push its agenda. Families of three Pulse nightclub victims are suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google, alleging that the companies did not do enough to stop the so-called Islamic State to post propaganda and push its agenda. Paul BrinkmannContact Reporter Privacy Policy Ten new plaintiffs have joined a federal lawsuit that targets Twitter, Google, and Facebook with allegations that ISIS used social media to radicalize the Pulse nightclub gunman. The lawsuit is the second in recent weeks where more than a dozen Pulse victims or their families are now suing over the tragedy. The other big lawsuit is directed at the G4S security firm, where the shooter worked as a security guard, and his wife. One of the new plaintiffs in the social media case is Christine Leinonen, mother of deceased victim Christopher “Dru” Leinonen. She has been one of the most visible activists among the Pulse victims’ families, appearing at the Democratic National Convention during the presidential campaign to speak about curbing gun violence. “I think this is one lawsuit that may actually work, so that we could prevent some future tragedies. It’s not going to eliminate them altogether because the [expletive] that want to distribute this kind of carnage can still meet in a coffeehouse or a cave or wherever,” Leinonen said. “They are taking men who might be slightly angry because they’re not getting along with their boss or their wife, and they’re making monsters out of them.” Money from the lawsuit would be put into her son’s foundation, called The Dru Project, to help start up and support gay-straight alliances in schools. She said the lawsuit is not about money. “Even if the damages are minimal, that’s irrelevant. I have the opportunity to eradicate future evil. That would promote my son’s honor, his name, his legacy,” Leinonen said. The lawsuit seeks a judge’s order declaring the social media companies to have violated the Anti-Terrorism Act by allowing ISIS sympathizers to use their services. The act defines terrorism as acts dangerous to human life, which appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, among other things, and provides for penalties against anyone aiding terrorists. Twitter, Google and Facebook have fought back in court, filing a motion to dismiss the case already. The social media lawsuit was first filed in December by family members controlling estates of three deceased victims, by the Michigan-based firm 1-800-Law-Firm. Ten more joined the suit last week, according to a new amended complaint. The social media suit alleges that the shooter, Omar Mateen, was radicalized by ISIS’s use of social media websites to conduct terrorist operations. However, the companies have argued that the suit alleges no facts indicating that the Orlando attack “was in any way impacted, helped by, or the result of ISIS’s presence on the social networks.” Mateen opened fire at Pulse, a gay nightclub south of downtown Orlando, about 2 a.m. on June 12, killing 49 people and injuring at least 68 others. Besides Leinonen, the new plaintiffs are family or estate representatives of deceased victims including: Lydia Perez and family members of the late Jean Carlos Mendez Perez; Carlos Sanfeliz and Maria Sanfeliz-Mendoza, family of the late Christopher Joseph Sanfeliz; Jose Luis Vielma, family of the late Luis Sergio Vielma; Jackson J. Josaphat, family of the late Jason B. Josaphat; Stanley Almodovar, family of the late Stanley Almodovar III. Four of the new plaintiffs are Pulse victims who recovered: Chris Littlestar, Nicholaz Perez, Asael Abad and Jillian Amador. The lawsuit cites numerous media accounts of investigations into the shooting by the FBI and by a Congressional committee. Although the suit says the FBI believes Mateen was radicalized by viewing online material, including videos, the suit doesn’t have any specific examples of Mateen viewing ISIS material. The only direct reference in the lawsuit to Mateen using social media is about him going on Facebook during the shooting itself to find reaction. Another lawsuit filed by victims’ families, filed targets the G4S security firm, where the shooter worked as a security guard, and his wife.

However, Samsung’s vision for VR is for its own Gear VR system, which is why competing options like Google Daydream don’t work… The best gifts for Android users VRHeads tried to install Daydream on the S8, only to find an error message appearing on the device. It could be part of an agreement that Samsung has it disabled, or it could be that the company just didn’t enable support. However, I’d say it’s most likely that Samsung just didn’t want a competing platform on their device, because why would they? Google’s Daydream VR platform, which debuted with the Pixel smartphones, runs through the Daydream View headset. The beauty of that system is while it offers one of the best mobile VR experiences available today, it isn’t limited to just one line of phones, or even just super expensive ones. Daydream runs on the high-end Pixel, but also on the affordable ZTE Axon 7, among several others. Samsung’s Gear VR, on the other hand, is limited to Samsung’s newer S-series and Note-series smartphones. Despite that, Gear VR is packed with excellent content from a variety of sources, and the new addition of the controller is a big win if you ask me, not to mention the fact that every S8 pre-order comes with a free Gear VR headset… Of course, if you really want to use Daydream on the S8 or S8+, you’ll be able to, it’s just not worth the effort, at least if you ask me… Ben Schoon @NexusBen Ben is a writer for 9to5Google who can also be found over on the 9to5Google YouTube channel and on Twitter @NexusBen.

Back in 2008, Google launched Map Maker to allow users to help fill in the gaps to by adding things like roads, bridges, and so on. Now, Map Maker is dead as of March 31st… The best gifts for Android users Why did Google pull the plug? For a number of reasons, the first of which being that much of Map Maker’s functionality is now directly integrated into Google Maps. For example, you can edit the details about businesses and various locations on Google Maps directly from the official app on Android and iOS, as well as doing so from a web browser. Over time, Google says that even more features from Map Maker will be brought over to the standard Maps service. Another reason might be moderation. Map Maker was open to all, and due to poor moderation, some interesting maps made their way to the public eye. That led to the service being temporarily pulled, then brought back later on, but now it has been officially shut down for good.

However, following the phasing out of that service for the average user, Google has apparently been working on a new issue tracking method in the background, and now it’s ready to debut alongside Android O. The best gifts for Android users As spotted by Android Police, Google has quietly shifted to a new issue tracker with the Android O developer preview. The tracker is simply found at issuetracker.google.com and is split into different categories called “components,” one of which is for Android O. According to Android O’s feedback page, this issue tracker has been used internally by Google employees for a while, Android O is just bringing it to the public eye. The issue tracker doesn’t just focus in on Android, though, as it also has “components” for various Google services and products.

(Bloomberg) -- Two weeks into a YouTube advertising boycott over hateful videos, Google is taking more steps to curb a crisis that escalated further than the company anticipated. Alphabet Inc.'s main division is introducing a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service, while expanding its definitions of offensive content.  Quotes in the article Johnson & Johnson JNJ ▲ 124.69 +0.14 +0.11% comScore Inc CSE ▲ 20.39 +0.34 +1.71% Facebook Inc FB ▲ 142.28 +0.23 +0.16% News Corp NWS ▼ 13.25 -0.25 -1.85% AdChoices A slew of major marketers halted spending on YouTube and Google's digital ad network after ads were highlighted running alongside videos promoting hate, violence and racism. Google's initial response, a promise of new controls for marketers, failed to stymie the boycott. The crisis ignited a simmering debate in digital advertising over quality assurance, or "brand safety," standards online.  Google has since improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler told Bloomberg News in a recent interview. Johnson & Johnson, one of largest advertisers to pull spending, said it is reversing its position in most major markets. Since the boycott began, Google has allocated more of its artificial intelligence tools to deciphering YouTube's enormous video library. The company is a pioneer in the field and has used machine learning, a powerful type of AI, to improve many of its products and services, including video recommendation on YouTube and ad-serving. Automatically classifying entire videos, then flagging and filtering content is a more difficult, expensive research endeavor -- one that Google hasn't focused on much, until now.   "We switched to a completely new generation of our latest and greatest machine-learning models," said Schindler. "We had not deployed it to this problem, because it was a tiny, tiny problem. We have limited resources."  In talks with big advertising clients, Google discovered the toxic YouTube videos flagged in recent media reports represented about one one-thousandth of a percent of total ads shown, Schindler said.  Still, with YouTube's size, that can add up quickly. And the attention on the issue coincided with mounting industry pressure on Google, the world's largest digital ad-seller, for more rigid measurement standards. A frequent demand has been for Google to let other companies verify standards on YouTube. Google is allowing this now, creating a "brand safety" reporting channel that lets YouTube ads be monitored by external partners like comScore Inc. and Integral Ad Science Inc., according to a company spokeswoman.  Google has made quick progress on its own, he said. Using the new machine-learning tools,  and "a lot more people," the company in the last two weeks flagged five times as many videos as "non-safe," or disabled from ads, than before.  "But it's five [times] on the smallest denominator you can imagine," Schindler said. "Although it has historically it has been a very small, small problem. We can make it an even smaller, smaller, smaller problem." Vocal critics suggest Google has ignored this problem. Some publishers and ad agencies have called on Google and rival Facebook Inc. to more actively police the content they host online. In a speech last week, Robert Thomson, Chief Executive Officer of News Corp., a frequent Google critic, said the two digital companies "have prospered mightily by peddling a flat earth philosophy that doesn't wish to distinguish between the fake and real because they make copious amounts of money from both." The YouTube ad boycott has pushed Google to beef up its policing. In its initial response, Google expanded its definition of hate speech to include marginalized groups. Now it's adding a new filter to disable ads on "dangerous and derogatory content," the company said. That includes language that promotes negative stereotypes about targeted groups or denies "sensitive historical events" such as the Holocaust.  Some researchers argue digital platforms should rely on humans to make these editorial decisions. Schindler said he has devoted more manpower to oversee brand safety issues, but stressed that only machine intelligence could contend with YouTube's size. "The problem cannot be solved by humans and it shouldn't be solved by humans," he said. Nor is the company willing to alter YouTube's fundamental formula. Google lets any user upload videos and sets thresholds for which ones can run ads. Tight restrictions on ads could cut funding for independent video creators and step between advertisers and consumers, Schindler said. Google has long pitched YouTube as a digital alternative to television for marketers, making the video service one of its fastest growing sources of ad revenue.  "Cutting away the ability for brands to truly interact with consumers by asking for one hundred percent safety is very, very, very unrealistic," Schindler said. The executive likened Google's ad business to an airline: Each faces long-tail risk beyond its control. "Can I guarantee you if I sell an airline ticket that the plane won't come down in the first million miles?" he asked. "You can't guarantee it. You can just depress the error rate to the lowest level."  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.
