It starts today with the launch of the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Elias Roman, Lead Product Manager at Google Play Music, said in announcing the partnership that those with a new Samsung device can now upload and stream up to 100,000 of their songs to the service absolutely free. That’s twice as much storage capacity exclusively for Samsung customers, we’re told, which should make it even easier for users to migrate their personal music collection to Google Play Music. It doesn’t end there, however, as new Samsung mobile devices will also come with a free three-month trial of the streaming service that offers ad-free, on-demand access to more than 40 million tracks and thousands of playlists curated for a variety of moods and occasions. A subscription also grants access to YouTube Red, the ad-free version of Google's popular video sharing service that launched in late 2015. Last but not least, Google Play Music will integrate seamlessly with Bixby when English language voice support arrives later this spring. Samsung launched its own streaming music service, called Milk Music, in early 2014 but shut it down back in September (probably because that name was so terrible, no?). Will Google’s partnership with Samsung sway your decision to pick up a Galaxy S8 or S8+ (or any other Samsung device on your radar) or is it just icing on the cake?

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

(Except some Hangouts features). Andrew Palmer Google could kill it just by creating an iMessage clone out of Android Messenger. RCS doesn't have adoption yet to make it useful. Still I agree WhatsApp has worked wonders for years. They pretty much release an update a day too on their beta Play Store listing. TechGuy22 kill whatsapp? are you drunk?

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

[Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares90 Deals News Pixel It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016.

Google Maps v9.51 beta adds new details about parking, prepares to improve route planning with parking suggestions and traffic charts [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 11:17am PDTApr 21, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares113 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 New parking indicators 2 Teardown 2.1 Change your route to nearby parking 2.2 Traffic Histogram 3 Download It's time for another update to Google Maps. Like so many other version bumps, this one includes a couple of great gifts to get users where they want to go. The focus of this release appears to be directed at parking. There are now indicators to show if there is on-site parking and whether it's free or paid. The theme continues into the teardown with a feature that will help drivers plan to find parking near their destination before getting there. If you're already signed up to the beta, this update might already be waiting for you. Otherwise, you can hit the link at the bottom to download the apk. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Free / Paid indicator for parking on detail pages Destinations now show if there is on-site parking New parking indicators Google has been on a roll with parking-related features since they were introduced earlier this year. The latest update digs a bit deeper to inform drivers about the parking situation before getting to a destination. The first addition can be found in the details page, which indicates if parking at that location is free or paid. As the screenshot shows, the line can be found just below the address in most cases. However, parking details aren't available for very many locations yet, so you probably can't count on seeing it at most destinations. At this time, the field only shows if parking is free or paid, but doesn't appear to include prices for paid parking. To get prices, you'll probably still have to resort to other methods. Perhaps this will be added in a future update like it was with fuel prices. Left: previous version. Right: latest version. (Look for the red and blue markers.) The other adjustment comes in the form of a new type of parking difficulty indicator. In previous versions, Maps would show one of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Limited. The latest update adds On-site to the mix, which shows drivers if they can park at their destination or plan to search for a spot nearby. Unfortunately, this change does introduce something of a regression in usability. As the screenshots above show, the on-site indicator replaces the difficulty marker. If parking happens to be fairly terrible at your destination, you'll have no idea about that until you're driving around with no hope of finding an available space. Considering how much effort has gone into assessing parking difficulty, this will probably be fixed fairly soon. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Change your route to nearby parking Navigation apps are great for getting us to a place, but most of them have been designed with a bit of intentional tunnel vision. We might say we want to go to some place, but what we really mean is that we have to drive to a slightly different place to park, then walk (or whatever) to the real destination. The Google Maps developers are working to address this common scenario and help drivers make the decision to reroute to nearby parking. New text in the apk describes a feature that will prompt users to add a parking lot to their routes. Basically, it will offer to search for parking lots and garages near the destination and offer up a list. Users will then be able to pick a parking location, which will then be added to the route. code <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING">Adds the parking lot to the route.</string> <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING_LONG">Adds %1$s as a parking lot on the route</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING_NEAR_DESTINATION">Find parking near destination</string> <string name="ADD_PARKING">Add parking</string> <string name="EDIT_PARKING">Edit parking</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING">Find parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_QUERY">Parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_FAILED">Can't search</string> <string name="NO_PARKING_LOTS_FOUND">Can't find any parking lots or garages near there</string> <string name="PARKING_NEARBY_DESTINATION">near %1$s</string> Based on the wording, I assume the parking location will be placed immediately before the destination instead of replacing it, which makes sense if you need walking directions after parking the car. On the subject of walking, search results will be presented with an estimate of how long it will take to walk from a parking area to the final destination. <string name="SEE_MORE_PARKING_OPTIONS">See more options</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_GREATER_THAN_ONE">+%1$s walk</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_LESS_THAN_ONE"><1 min walk</string> There seems to be one catch: The parking recommendations seem to be incompatible with routes involving multiple stops. I doubt there's a technical reason these two features can't coexist, so it's probably a decision to avoid building an overcomplicated interface. <string name="PARKING_NOT_SUPPORTED_MESSAGE">Parking was removed because it's not supported for multiple stops</string> Overall, I think this is going to be a great addition and will save a lot of people from the pattern of first driving to a place and then driving in circles for another 15-20 minutes desperately searching for parking. Traffic Histogram For many years, Google has been able to tell us with bewildering accuracy just how long a drive should take. This isn't just a matter of calculating distance and speed limits, but also making estimates based on established traffic patterns. While it's nice to get an idea of the total time, some drivers certainly want to know if part of their trip is going involve slowly creeping through nearly standstill traffic. Google is working to put that information in front of users with a chart of anticipated traffic density throughout a drive. The string below spells out the concept pretty clearly. <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_TRAFFIC_TREND_BAR_CHART">A time-series histogram showing how much traffic is on your route today.</string> There's next to zero information beyond the string below, but I would expect the histogram to look like the busyness chart introduced late last year, but with shorter time increments – maybe every 10 or 15 minutes. Most people will probably see this as a "nice to know" type of feature, but it could be a life saver for drivers that get panicky in heavy traffic, or at least a useful tool for road trippers. I know I'd like to get a good look at traffic in a few spots before driving down to the Bay Area next month.

Heck, one could already say the same regarding liabilities about lane guidance on navigation software! They make drivers clog the left lanes and causing accidents (sarcasm).

Google, the biggest player in this world, is at the center of the plan, although the company and its partners are keen to present the initiative as a group effort. The Coalition for Better Ads published a list of undesirable online ads earlier this year. Google plans to add a feature to its Chrome web browser that would disable those ads. The feature is designed for publishers, rather than a tool for consumers, and would operate the same way Chrome already filters ads that are undesirable in other ways like those that drain computer batteries, according to people familiar with the plans. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Google’s potential decision earlier this week, sparking criticism that the search ad giant was again exerting too much control over the market for digital ads. Now industry partners are stressing that the plan is a group effort and not finalized. They also distanced Google’s tool from the existing ad blockers that prompted the initiative in the first place. “There is no ad-blocker that’s going into a browser,” Randall Rothenberg, head of the Interactive Advertising Bureau trade group, said, although he wouldn’t offer further details on the tool. “What we want is something that’s industry-wide, that can demonstrably improve user experience and that’s embraced by pretty much everyone.” Rothenberg helped set up the Coalition for Better Ads in September. Beyond Google, members include some of the largest marketers, ad agencies, media organizations and Facebook Inc. In March, the group issued its list of ad units — including those that takeover entire screens or videos that start automatically — that it claimed are most likely to prompt people to download ad blockers. The Chrome option is different from current ad-blockers, which are downloaded as mobile apps or web browser plug-ins to zap most marketing messages, according to people familiar with the plans. Instead it may look like similar tools that Google builds into its browser. Last fall, Chrome began automatically disabling ads that use multimedia Flash players, citing computer battery drain. People in the Coalition said they expect Google will also hold its own search, display and YouTube ads to the same standards it imposes on the rest of the industry, although the terms have not been finalized. The people asked not to be identified discussing private matters. Alphabet Inc.’s Google declined to comment on potential Chrome features. However, the company emphasized that its plans are part of a group effort. “Google alone cannot solve for the incentives users have to install ad blockers,” a company spokeswoman said. “We need an industry approach that is data-driven and endorsed by everyone.” Getting broad support is hard. The ad industry has diverse interests and Google is still facing a backlash over its failure to quell offensive videos on YouTube. Some of the types of ads derided in the Coalition’s list, such as full-screen takeovers and automatic pre-roll video ads with sound, can deliver three to four times higher ad rates for publishers, according to Matt McGowan, president of marketing software firm Adestra Ltd. Many of these media companies are already suffering declining revenue as digital ad spending moves increasingly to Google’s and Facebook’s dominant platforms. Stuart Ingis, a lawyer for Venable LLP who counsels the Coalition for Better Ads, said the group is still months away from issuing policies on “acceptable” ad standards. “All the options are on the table,” he said. An attempt from Google, the largest digital ad-seller, to limit other companies’ ads through its browser could open the company to further antitrust scrutiny. Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, wrote on Twitter that she would “follow this new feature” closely. She is already overseeing a multi-pronged antitrust case against Google. As ad-blocking tools spread, Google has plotted ways to curb the potential impact on its primary business. Scott Spencer, a veteran director of its display ad unit, is in charge of its efforts and he sits on the Coalition board. In the past, Google has reportedly paid the makers of consumer ad-blocking tools to keep Google’s ads off their blacklists. Owning a filtering solution, such as a built-in Chrome feature, would help Google avoid this. It also addresses the company’s longstanding obsession with eliminating any obstacle between it and its users. “The situation tweaks the most paranoid part of Google’s culture — to never be disintermediated,” said Ari Paparo, a former Google ad executive who runs ad tech company Beeswax. Chrome was launched in 2008 so Google’s search engine would not be at the mercy of browser providers of the time such as Microsoft Corp. Leaders of the ads Coalition said other tech companies, like Microsoft and Facebook, will be involved in setting standards. “Something that’s only one browser is not really worth it,” said Rothenberg. Yet, while the group is large, it is not comprehensive. Apple Inc., which controls the Safari browser on iPhones, and The Mozilla Corporation, which runs the Firefox browser, are not members of the Coalition. Firefox includes a browser setting that blocks ads and Apple began allowing third-party tools that block content on its mobile browser last year. “Not everyone is going to be involved at the same time,” Rothenberg said. “This ain’t the UN.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: ChromeGoogle You may also like AfriOne unveils manufacturing plant for ‘Made in Nigeria’ phones 1 day ago  Technology Samsung's Galaxy S8 hits stores, aims to move on from recall crisis 1 day ago  Technology On AI & AR, Facebook goes for the kill 1 day ago  Technology Latest Death toll spikes to 20 in Venezuela protests 2 hours ago  World Religion has become immunity under Buhari, says CAN 2 hours ago  Nigeria Airport reopening: Different strokes for different folks 2 hours ago  Saturday Magazine Adewole wants tertiary hospitals to prepare against epidemic outbreak 2 hours ago  Nigeria Excitement at Hi-Impact Planet, as Bisola Aiyeola of BBN rates facility high 2 hours ago  Travel & Tourism More   Communication NITDA denies employment racketeering reports 1 day ago   Fakers control 10% phone market share in Nigeria 1 day ago   ​EFCC requires computer forensic experts to win cases, says Adeoye 1 day ago   SMSaaS has strong future with Telcos as ‘Gatekeepers’, says Pearson 14 Apr   Stakeholders frown at connectivity issues 14 Apr   Top News Nigeria Africa World Metro Opinion Editorial Contributors Columnists Cartoons Business Appointments Business News Business RoundUp Industry Aviation Capital Market Communications Energy DrillBytes Maritime SweetCrude Infrastructure Money Technology Gadgets Telecoms Social Media Technology Sport Football Boxing Athletics Tennis Golf Arts Arts Art House Artfolk Revue Film Literature Music Theatre Visual Arts Features Policy & Politics BusinessAgro Education Executive Motoring Executive Briefs Focus Friday Worship Law Media Science Youth Speak Property Environment Mortgage Finance Real Estate Urban Development Guardian Woman Entrepreneurship GW Fiction Personality Issues WIMBIZ Saturday Magazine Youth Magazine Just Human Life & Style Love & Life Transition Travel & Tourism Celebrity Brand Intelligence Gardening Weekend Beats Sunday Magazine Ibru Ecumenical Centre Campus CityFile News Feature Living Healthy Diet Living Wellbeing Newspeople Guardian TV News Opinion Fashion Sport Entertainment Science & Tech GTV Exclusive Guardian Life Home Lifestyle Showbiz Trending LS Diaries On The Cover The Guardian Home About Us Advertise With Us |     Powered by Ventra Copyright © 2017 Guardian Newspapers.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares84 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Syukri Lajin Google doesn't backup call history and sms. that's the only shitty part i have to complain about. JohnyNoLegs It does do SMS 100% as i just restored from a reset. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Killa Can you head into your Google Drive and look at the Backups for your Pixel? Is each content type separated out...like text, call history, etc.? Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Chang Hi, I posted this, but it got kicked to bottom of thread. So, here it is again. Hope it is some help. Gen. Chang • 43 minutes ago Hi all, I wonder if this problem has occurred after any major updates? After I updated to Nougat, I had several issues, but after learning that resetting all app preferences from the app manager page, everything is working as it should. Better, in fact, than even my update to Marshmallow. By far, better Battery savings overnight now too. I wonder if a similar reset might help solve the back up issue for you. It erases all previous settings, but not data. And rebuilds those from scratch. Try turning off back ups, and turn off restore too. As that erases the previous version, then turn off, back on, to reboot. Then go back and turn on back up and restore, creating all NEW back ups. I would reset both app preferences, and erase and rebuild backed up data. This is the easiest thing to do, and not as damaging as a factory reset. Xchris Big deal. Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, that's one of you so far. abc "The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites" That's just sad for Android then. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7. Hexlattice On slower internet speeds, Photos has a really hard time trying to backup larger files... Normally, getting on a faster network will fix the problem, but if the files are old enough, it's like Photos gives up on trying and I end up having some videos never backup :( abc Pixel problems? https://i.imgflip.com/h8wog.jpg?a414600 Gen. Chang Hi all, I wonder if this problem has occurred after any major updates? After I updated to Nougat, I had several issues, but after learning that resetting all app preferences from the app manager page, everything is working as it should. Better, in fact, than even my update to Marshmallow. By far, better Battery savings overnight now too. I wonder if a similar reset might help solve the back up issue for you. It erases all previous settings, but not data. And rebuilds those from scratch. Try turning off back ups, and turn off restore too. As that erases the previous version, then turn off, back on, to reboot. Then go back and turn on back up and restore, creating all NEW back ups. I would reset both app preferences, and erase and rebuild backed up data. This is the easiest thing to do, and not as damaging as a factory reset. Praneeth Kancherla They have been looking into it from past few months. Backups on my Pixel XL never worked. I've contacted support through chat option on the phone and all information I got at the end is Google is aware of this issue,actively working on fixing it and fix will be available soon. It looks meaning of soon is certainly different​ in Google's dictionary. Lately my phone has developed so much lag even while doing simple tasks like using keyboard in any app, browsing internet and settings. Google support is okay to replace my device after verifying warranty but cannot ship replacement first even if I'm okay with hold on my credit card for full amount and covering shipping charges. They say replacement may take anytime from 7-10 business days and I need to buy another phone. The reason they quote is I'm not the original buyer. But they were able to verify and confirm that it's​ still under warranty. They are okay with honoring the warranty but not willing to ship replacement first even if I'm okay with covering charges that may incur in doing that. All these issues for $750 smartphone and they taking months to resolve issues without any possible workaround is just terrible in my opinion. I'll still use Pixel and Android as I like them compared to Apple and its ecosystem but I feel Google is certainly not doing enough to retain consumers like me.

It’s handy, sure, but the new tab page can be much more useful. The key to productivity is finding out what works for you. Don’t just apply what a productivity guru says without thinking about your needs. The New Tab page can serve many purposes. If you don’t need a collection of your most visited sites, turn it into something you actually need. Web apps and extensions are the best way to make this happen. But when you are choosing one, try to find something that works across all browsers. That way, you aren’t restricted to one browser or device alone. 1. Searf (Web): Customized Search Bar and Bookmarks You can integrate different search engines in the URL bar How To Create Custom Search Engines In Google Chrome How To Create Custom Search Engines In Google Chrome Read More of any browser you use. But if that’s not you, Searf is the next best option. In the setup process, Searf asks you to choose your favorite websites. Then it asks you for the search engines you use most often. Searf will combine your answers into a custom page for you, which looks a lot like the Google homepage. In the top-left corner, you’ll find your favorite sites, while the large search bar dominates the page. This bar can search whichever engines you chose, like Google, Wikipedia, or YouTube. Searf has an extension for Google Chrome, but also works as a standalone web app. Make it the default address for any New Tab page in your browser’s settings. 2. Minimalist (Web): Portable Minimalist To-Do List To be productive, you need to know what you have to do next. Minimalist is a gorgeous and clutter-free to-do list 8 Super Simple To-Do List Tools to Keep You Focused 8 Super Simple To-Do List Tools to Keep You Focused A to-do list is the simplest productivity system. These eight minimalist to-do list tools are for tracking your daily tasks without the fuss. Read More that works in any web browser. It’s one large page with the default to-do list in the middle of it. In the left-side pane, you can create additional lists, to separate your “work tasks” and your “grocery” lists. Finish an item and check the box next to it, so Minimalist will give it a satisfying strikethrough. Nothing like striking items on a to-do list, is there? You can create a new list and add the custom URL as your New Tab page. I would also recommend signing in to it with Google, since that will let you visit Minimalist.com from any device and bring up your list. 3. Awesome HQ (Web): Windows-Like Tiles for Your Browser If you loved the look of Windows Phone’s Live Tiles, then Awesome HQ is for you. The tile-like interface also makes it one of the few New Tab pages that you can use on a mobile browser as well. You will need to sign in with a Google login Should You Think Twice Before Logging In Using Social Accounts? Should You Think Twice Before Logging In Using Social Accounts? Read More to choose the sites you want to add as tiles. Once logged in, Awesome HQ will bring up weather information for your location, arrange bookmarks as beautiful logos, and even add widgets like the latest XKCD comic. Be warned that the login process is a bit temperamental. It didn’t work for one of the writers at MakeUseOf, but did for another. 4. Shrib / ProtectedText / Textpad (Web): A Simple Notepad We couldn’t choose between these three wonderful online notepads to use as a New Tab page, so see what works best for you. Shrib is one of our favorite web apps that don’t need you to register 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use Do you like websites which have no sign-ups, no registerations, and no downloads? Then, you will like these hassle free web apps and sites which make daily productivity a lot easier. Read More . As long as you bookmark the URL, you’re good to go. It will auto-save anything you type in the notepad. Protected Text lets you choose your URL name, which is a big bonus. It also password-protects the document. The design is a bit old-school and clunky, but no one else will see what you type. Textpad is the most modern of three, a minimalistic notepad that also counts characters and words. The only problem is it saves data locally, so you can’t use it across browsers. But hey, your notes aren’t going into the cloud, so that’s a security boost. 5. Live Start Page (Chrome, Firefox, Opera): The All-in-One Extension There are some things web apps can’t do. Live Start Page is perhaps the best cross-platform New Tab extension. Live Start Page has three basic features. It showcases beautiful live wallpapers as backgrounds, with a new one coming every day. There’s a meditation mode to help you destress and focus on what matters. And the productivity dashboard 10 Most Productive New Tab Extensions For Google Chrome 10 Most Productive New Tab Extensions For Google Chrome When you start a new tab in a browser, are you looking to go somewhere or are you looking for information to come to you?

Natively, it supports Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. But in reality, apart from Edge and Safari, it works on any browser. Remember, you can now install Chrome extensions on any Chromium-based browsers.

Instead, it will filter ads that don’t meet Google’s specific criteria. The criteria, outlined in the Initial Better Ads Standards, deem around 12 current advertising systems and techniques to be unsuitable and downright annoying for users. Pre-content pop-ups, ads that just won’t stop playing or shutting up, or ads that stick to panes of a browser tab are all on the naughty list. Google Chrome could soon feature its own adblocker to stop users installing their own Largely Google, and its advertising coalition partners, explained that these ad methods resulted in an “increased propensity for consumers to adopt ad blockers”. And Google doesn’t want you to install adblockers. Alphabet announced that Google’s advertising revenue grew 17% year-on-year to US$22.4-billion in Q4 2016 alone. According to Juniper Research (cited by CNBC), adblocking could cost the ad industry around US$22-billion by 2020. That’s not a statistic the internet giant wants to see. The benefits for you, and for the web While adding its own adblocking system to Chrome has obvious company benefits, is pretty big news for both consumers and site-owners too. Chrome’s adblocker gives the company the power to drop all ads from a site if said site doesn’t adhere to its standards. For sites, this spells entire advertising system changes, better standards, and overall, a cleaner web. Considering Chrome’s browser market share — as high as 58% depending on your source — advertisers will have to adhere sooner or later. For consumers, this could mark the beginning of a more pleasant web, with less clutter, and fewer annoyances. WSJ’s report suggests that the feature could be announced “within weeks” but that’s if the internet giant ultimately follows through with the plan. Now, if Google can only do something about those toxic comment sections.

Rumor: Google to bake ad-blocking into Chrome browser by Wayne Manion  9:00 AM on April 21, 2017 The Wall Street Journal reports that Google intends to include an ad-blocking component in future versions of its popular Chrome web browser. The new feature reportedly will be enabled by default in both the desktop and mobile versions of the browser. The WSJ says the rumors come from sources "familiar with Google's plans." The paper says the blocking will be targeted at ads deemed "beneath a threshhold of consumer acceptability." While at first the notion that a major player in online advertising would offer features to disable ads in one of its most popular software products seems counter-intuitve, recent trends suggest the idea is not as strange as it sounds at first. According to the WSJ's sources, the built-in ad-blocker would stop ads that do not conform to the specifications of the Coalition for Better Ads, which counts both Google and Facebook as members. According to this industry body, non-compliant content includes autoplaying video ads with sound, pop-ups, and ads with countdown timers. The WSJ goes on to report that Google may be considering blocking all ads, compliant and not, on pages that show even one non-compliant ad. This move may be a result of the increasing numbers of users employing ad-blocking browser extensions like Adblock Plus and uBlock Origin. Desktop users have long been able to use ad-blocking extensions like these within Chrome to keep this type of content off their screen, but the mobile versions of the browser lack support for extensions. If integrated blocking of ads with particularly annoying delivery methods can prevent users from installing sofware that blocks all ads, compliant advertisers could stand to benefit. Of course, Google has a large dog in this fight, as well. The company is one of the largest sellers of online advertising around, and it's paid Adblock Plus developer Eyeo to whitelist its ads for at least some period of time in the past. We expect there's no love lost between Eyeo and Google, and Mountain View would doubtless like to keep the considerable fees it pays the plugin developer to ensure its ads appear even to Adblock Plus-running users. Including a proprietary ad-blocking plugin that works on Google's terms would doubtless give a decent swath of Chrome users no reason to install Eyeo's product. The problem with Google's approach is that it would create a huge conflict of interest. As the owner of one of the most popular browsers in the world, Google would stand to wield an enormous amount of power over the shape of the web advertising market by developing an ad-blocking plugin. If the company's AdSense products just so happen to comply with its own internal guidelines by default, Google could (intentionally or otherwise) favor the display of its own ad products over those of other ad networks. Google's rumored move could also have a chilling effect on the revenue of sites that rely on advertising to keep the lights on. If the company implements the aggressive form of ad-blocking described above wherein one non-compliant ad would cause Google to block all ads on a page, it's not clear how a publisher would appeal the decision or return to good standing. By creating a de facto standard for acceptable ads, Google could also limit the amount of money advertisers might be willing to funnel into traditional ad campaigns, leading to a rise in harder-to-track and impossible-to-block forms of content like sponsored native articles. For our part, TR has always taken every reasonable measure to make sure advertisements with these objectionable techniques don't appear to readers on our site. Fewer users employing blanket bans on advertising is something that we'd like to see, but we're not sure that a Google-produced plugin is the best arbiter of what constitutes an acceptable ad. Either way, we'd encourage readers to whitelist TR in their ad blockers. You'll find we run ads that are already plenty acceptable by any standard.

Google, the biggest player in this world, is at the centre of the plan, although the company and its partners are keen to present the initiative as a group effort. The Coalition for Better Ads published a list of undesirable online ads earlier this year. Google plans to add a feature to its Chrome web browser that would disable those ads. The feature is designed for publishers, rather than a tool for consumers, and would operate the same way Chrome already filters ads that are undesirable in other ways like those that drain computer batteries, according to people familiar with the plans. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Google’s potential decision earlier this week, sparking criticism that the search ad giant was again exerting too much control over the market for digital ads. Now industry partners are stressing that the plan is a group effort and not finalised. They also distanced Google’s tool from the existing ad blockers that prompted the initiative in the first place.  “There is no ad-blocker that’s going into a browser,” Randall Rothenberg, head of the Interactive Advertising Bureau trade group, said, although he wouldn’t offer further details on the tool. “What we want is something that’s industry-wide, that can demonstrably improve user experience and that’s embraced by pretty much everyone.”  Rothenberg helped set up the Coalition for Better Ads in September. Beyond Google, members include some of the largest marketers, ad agencies, media organisations and Facebook Inc. In March, the group issued its list of ad units — including those that takeover entire screens or videos that start automatically — that it claimed are most likely to prompt people to download ad blockers. The Chrome option is different from current ad-blockers, which are downloaded as mobile apps or web browser plug-ins to zap most marketing messages, according to people familiar with the plans. Instead it may look like similar tools that Google builds into its browser. Last fall, Chrome began automatically disabling ads that use multimedia Flash players, citing computer battery drain. People in the Coalition said they expect Google will also hold its own search, display and YouTube ads to the same standards it imposes on the rest of the industry, although the terms have not been finalised. The people asked not to be identified discussing private matters. Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to comment on potential Chrome features. However, the company emphasised that its plans are part of a group effort. “Google alone cannot solve for the incentives users have to install ad blockers,” a company spokeswoman said. “We need an industry approach that is data-driven and endorsed by everyone.”  Getting broad support is hard. The ad industry has diverse interests and Google is still facing a backlash over its failure to quell offensive videos on YouTube. Some of the types of ads derided in the Coalition’s list, such as full-screen takeovers and automatic pre-roll video ads with sound, can deliver three to four times higher ad rates for publishers, according to Matt McGowan, president of marketing software firm Adestra Ltd. Many of these media companies are already suffering declining revenue as digital ad spending moves increasingly to Google’s and Facebook’s dominant platforms.  Stuart Ingis, a lawyer for Venable LLP who counsels the Coalition for Better Ads, said the group is still months away from issuing policies on “acceptable” ad standards. ”All the options are on the table,” he said.  An attempt from Google, the largest digital ad-seller, to limit other companies’ ads through its browser could open the company to further antitrust scrutiny. Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, wrote on Twitter that she would “follow this new feature” closely. She is already overseeing a multi-pronged antitrust case against Google. As ad-blocking tools spread, Google has plotted ways to curb the potential impact on its primary business. Scott Spencer, a veteran director of its display ad unit, is in charge of its efforts and he sits on the Coalition board. In the past, Google has reportedly paid the makers of consumer ad-blocking tools to keep Google’s ads off their blacklists. Owning a filtering solution, such as a built-in Chrome feature, would help Google avoid this. It also addresses the company’s longstanding obsession with eliminating any obstacle between it and its users. “The situation tweaks the most paranoid part of Google’s culture — to never be disintermediated,” said Ari Paparo, a former Google ad executive who runs ad tech company Beeswax. Chrome was launched in 2008 so Google’s search engine would not be at the mercy of browser providers of the time such as Microsoft Corp Leaders of the ads Coalition said other tech companies, like Microsoft and Facebook, will be involved in setting standards. “Something that’s only one browser is not really worth it,” said Rothenberg.  Yet, while the group is large, it is not comprehensive. Apple Inc, which controls the Safari browser on iPhones, and The Mozilla Corporation, which runs the Firefox browser, are not members of the Coalition. Firefox includes a browser setting that blocks ads and Apple began allowing third-party tools that block content on its mobile browser last year.  “Not everyone is going to be involved at the same time,” Rothenberg said. “This ain’t the UN.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Microsoft's goodbye to Wunderlist, launches To-Do app to keep us organised (VIDEO) Google and partners try to block the march of ad-blockers Amazon's Twitch wants more game-streamers to make money on site Elon Musk on mission to link human brains with computers in four years Bring a dinosaur to life with your phone (VIDEO) Samsung users see red over ‘tinted’ Galaxy S8 screen Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone’s 10th anniversary Hackers exploit Japan’s mobile gamers with fake fantasy cash 90-second recap of Samsung Galaxy S8 with ‘Gadgets with Gurman’ (VIDEO) Netflix growth misses mark despite strong earnings Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Powerful women honoured for philanthropic work Reuters Video: Family affair as Chris Pratt gets star Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines Related Articles Machine learning may fix ad placement dispute, says Google Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan suspend YouTube ads over offensive videos (VIDEO) AT&T, Verizon join Google ad boycott Google apologises to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco Google brings virtual reality to updated Chrome mobile browser Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware.

Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version.

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

The company that Palihapitiya lured the engineers to is called Groq Inc., at least for now - but there's little known about Groq. There are a few SEC filings from October and December, with the company raising $10.3 million. In its SEC documents, Groq named three principals: Jonathan Ross, who helped invent the TPU, Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X "moonshot factory" and Palihapitiya, the founder of investment firm Social Capital. The listed address is Social Capital's headquarters, reports CNBC.   Palihapitiya said in an email: "We're really excited about Groq. It's too early to talk specifics, but we think what they're building could become a fundamental building block for the next generation of computing". The fundamental building block for the next generation of computing? Alright, now I'm excited.   During an interview on Squawk Box, Palihapitiya said: "They randomly mentioned that they built their own chip for AI and I thought, what is going on here, why is Google competing with Intel?". Last month, Palihapitiya said that the innovation of driving towards the next big leap in processors "can empower companies like Facebook and Amazon, Tesla, the government to do things with machine learning and computers that nobody could do before".   Bring it on.

A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC and NASA to add video clips, photos, and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. Sean Askay, engineering manager with Google Earth, demonstrates features displayed in the background. The mapping service is becoming more of a tool for adventure. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You also can get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. The producers of “Sesame Street” show off Muppets from co-productions around the world; the map shows where the Muppets live and offer stories about the region and its culture. Separately, a new “I’m Feeling Lucky” feature takes you to a location selected at random. Google Earth is highlighting some 20,000 lesser-known destinations — the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken, part of a national marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys.  A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. The update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google says that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or “getting lost.” With the update, Google Earth now works on Google’s Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets because of the heavy graphics involved; Google is rolling out updates for Android, but there’s no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. Some older features still will require a software download on desktops. That includes maps of Mars and the moon through a partnership with NASA. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook’s Oculus Rift, not just the HTC Vive. But it won’t work with cheaper, phone-based VR systems, such as Google’s Daydream and Samsung’s Gear VR.

Fancy people, this one's for you. If you own a Mercedes and also have either a Google Home or Amazon Echo speaker, you can now start your car with the sound of your voice. All 2016 and 2017 Mercedes-Benz models in the US now work with Amazon and Google's voice-powered speakers. If you have a Google Home device, just say "Ok Google, tell Mercedes me to start my car" to get your engine going. Or, if you have an Amazon Alexa-powered device, say "Alexa, ask Mercedes Me to send an address to the car" before you hit the road. This way, you won't have to fumble with your navigation system when you're ready to roll. You can also ask your speaker to remotely lock your vehicle.

"Mercedes-Benz's goal is creating an intelligent ecosystem around cars, and developing cutting-edge technology to make everyday life more convenient for our customers." To get it to work, you'll need an active Mercedes me account and mbrace subscription. From there, just download the Google Home or Amazon Alexa app and connect it with Mercedes me. The feature is currently available in the US, and Mercedes plans to launch it in Europe later this year. Mercedes earlier this month teamed up with Bosch to make robo-taxis a reality by the beginning of the next decade. By combining forces, it is expected that Mercedes will knock several years off of its existing driverless vehicle efforts.

With its doodle, Google has tried to guide us on ways we can play our roles as caretakers of the environment, which in turn will also help protect the Earth.   ﻿ By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Saturday, April 22, 2017 - 08:38 Comment 0 Comment Image courtesy: Google New Delhi: April 22nd every year marks the onset of Earth Day. A day that is celebrated annually to raise awareness about our home planet and how we can save and protect it from recurring damage. Started in the year 1970, Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network and celebrated in more than 193 countries each year. Every year, the event is celebrated under a different theme. The theme for 2017 is “Environmental and Climate Literacy”, chosen to empower everyone with the knowledge to inspire action in defense of environmental protection. With this in mind, Google decided to impart some wisdom on how to safeguard the environment and encourage people across the world to be more environmentally friendly with its interactive doodle today. Google's latest doodle for Earth Day is in the form of a slideshow and shows a fox who dreams about an Earth that's been polluted and adversely affected by climate change and how it makes small changes in its lifestyle to avoid the dream turning into a reality. In present times, when the dangers of climate change and global warming loom as large as ever, there is a constant pressure upon the entire world to do their bit and contribute towards the betterment of our home planet. Why? Because there is only one Earth. The doodle also features Momo the cat, and Google Weather's favorite frog who accompany the fox in its quest to save the environment. With its doodle, Google has tried to guide us on ways we can play our roles as caretakers of the environment, which in turn will also help protect the Earth. Efforts like using less electricity, riding bicycle instead of buses, use of wind turbines and solar panels and plant greenery. However, Earth Day is not just an event to be observed on one specific day. It is primarily a reminder for all to do our rightful duty to save our planet everyday. Earth Day is a motivation for you to start right now. Happy Earth Day!

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

Meet the Contributors → Bio Roundup: Spinraza Woes, Science March, Baseline Launch & More Ben Fidler April 21st, 2017 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Rumblings of a new Obamacare replacement surfaced this week, while scientists and their supporters prepared for Saturday’s—a.k.a. Earth Day’s—nationwide Marches for Science. Our own reporting focused this week on the fallout from high drug prices, with a look at the frustration of families whose children have had trouble gaining access to the first drug ever approved for the rare spinal muscular atrophy. Elsewhere, Google’s cousin Verily finally launched a much ballyhooed health study, Novartis grabbed more momentum in the race toward the first CAR-T cell therapy approval, and a lot more news happened around the Xconomy network, with reports from Seattle to San Antonio and Indianapolis to North Carolina. Let’s get to the roundup. TOP STORIES —The high price and limited access to nusinersen (Spinraza), the first approved drug for spinal muscular atrophy, has left families of patients exasperated. but data that Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) will present at the American Academy of Neurology meeting next week could loosen the restrictions. Xconomy heard from SMA families and clinicians about the logistical and insurance challenges that have slowed the nusinersen rollout. —Phoenix Biotechnology, a small San Antonio firm, has spent more than a decade trying to develop a plant-based drug for cancer. Running out of time and money, the company is pinning its future on preclinical data showing the drug might have a chance to treat Alzheimer’s disease. —After three years of planning, Verily, once known as Google Life Sciences, has begun a long-range health study called “Baseline” with at least 10,000 participants across four years, aiming to learn about the biological changes underpinning the shift from health to illness. People who have grown accustomed to instant health information from their wearables might be surprised; Verily is not going to share the day-to-day data it gathers via its homebrewed “Study Watch.” MARCH FOR SCIENCE, TRUMPCARE REVIVAL? —Looking ahead to the March for Science on Saturday, Prothena CEO Gene Kinney penned this op-ed about the need for biotech professionals to explain science better to folks who aren’t immersed in the field. —Weeks after the GOP’s healthcare plan crashed without reaching a House vote, efforts have begun to revive the bill, Politico reported. The news comes as the Trump administration has threatened to revoke federal subsidies that help support the Affordable Care Act. Here’s more in the Washington Post. TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS —A rheumatoid arthritis drug from Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and partner Incyte (NASDAQ: INCY) that was expected to win FDA approval was instead rejected, as the regulator asked the companies to provide more dosing and safety data. —Ultragenyx (NASDAQ: RARE), of Novato, CA, and partner Kyowa Hakko Kirin aim to file for approval of burosumab, for the rare genetic disease X-linked hypophosphatemia, after the drug hit its main goal in a Phase 3 trial. —Novartis’s CTL-019 grabbed a second FDA “breakthrough” designation, this time in the diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Novartis is racing Kite Pharma (NASDAQ: KITE) to get the first CAR-T cancer immunotherapy across the finish line. Here’s more from TheStreet.com. —Two weeks after a round of bad news, Redwood City, CA-based OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: OMED), disclosed another clinical trial failure this week, this time in lung cancer. The firm plans to begin “a comprehensive portfolio prioritization review immediately.” —Even though an independent board said in February that an experimental immunotherapy for kidney cancer from Argos Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ARGS) was unlikely to work, the Durham, NC, company said this week it would press on with the Phase 3 trial. Argos said its own analysis suggests a longer follow-up time may yet show a beneficial effect. MONEY MANEUVERS —Research Triangle Park, NC-based G1 Therapeutics unveiled plans for an initial public offering to finance clinical trials for its experimental cancer therapies that target two enzymes, CDK 4 and 6, that are key to cellular division. —Controversial former Dendreon CEO Mitch Gold is back on Wall Street, now that his latest startup, Seattle-based Alpine Immune Sciences, has cut a deal to merge with struggling Nivalis Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NVLS) in a bid to go public. The combined company will be run by Gold and take on the Alpine name. —Boston-based ZappRx, a startup that helps patients order and refill specialty medicine prescriptions, raised $25 million in new funding and added GV, the venture capital arm of Google, to its base of investors. PARP TALK, ETC. —Waltham, MA-based Tesaro (NASDAQ: TSRO) disclosed that its recently approved cancer drug, a so-called PARP inhibitor named niraparib (Zejula), would cost $9,833 a month for a 200 mg dose. While lower than rival drugs, the actual price is a more complicated because patients start on a higher, more expensive dose, and many move to lower doses afterwards. Here’s more in Endpoints. —In other PARP blocker news, AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) said that its PARP inhibitor velaparib failed two Phase 3 trials in lung and breast cancer. —UniQure (NASDAQ: QURE) will pull alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera), the Western world’s first ever approved gene therapy, from the market in October. Glybera was a flop—only one patient was treated with it commercially—but it also played an important role in the advancement of gene therapy as a field. —The legal feud continued between Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDQ: REGN) and Sanofi. Already battling over their cholesterol-lowering PCSK9 blockers, Amgen sued over patents granted to Regeneron and Sanofi for their newly approved eczema drug, dupilumab (Dupixent). Expecting the lawsuit, Regeneron and Sanofi had filed a pre-emptive legal strike against Amgen last month. Here’s more in FiercePharma. Alex Lash and Frank Vinluan contributed to this report.

Which Won't Make it to 2067? View All Editorials → Apple Hires Satellite Experts away from Google Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin 1 minute read Apr 21st, 2017 9:05 PM EDT | Analysis Apple has hired away a pair of Google’s top satellite experts, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Citing unnamed sources, Mr. Gurman reported that Apple hired John Fenwick, who previously led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering at Google. They are part of a new hardware team at Apple headed by another former Googler, Dropcam cofounder Greg Duffy. Apple in the Skies? Apple Hires Satellite Experts The first question you might have is why Apple would want to make satellites. The answer to that could be in a recent Boeing regulatory filing. According to Bloomberg, Boeing is working on plans for a network of 1,000 satellites that would provide broadband internet access. That service could be offered anywhere, including areas with no wired or wireless telephone infrastructure. Boeing has reportedly talked to Apple about being part of the project. Whether or not that’s true, and whether or not Apple is going to work with Boeing, it’s easy to understand that Apple could be interested in offering that sort of service. Opening up the third world to high speed internet access is a goal of many tech giants, and that would certainly include Apple. The company could also turn such an operation into a direct revenue generator in the developed world. Bloomberg noted that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. forecasted $30 billion in satellite internet revenues by 2025. That’s serious money even for Apple. Apple could also use a satellite fleet for multiple purposes. The company could take its own photographs for Apple Maps, and sell those images on the open market like Google. Apple could also contribute to or compete with existing global positioning systems. Perhaps most importantly, Apple could use satellites to augment its own data distribution for iTunes and the App Store. Or Maybe Not Apple has tons of projects, most of which get killed along the way. Just because Apple hired two satellite experts and has them working in a new hardware team doesn’t necessarily mean Apple will ever be involved with satellites. In addition, just because these two folks are satellite experts doesn’t necessarily mean this team is even working on satellites. They’re reporting to someone who isn’t a satellite expert, for instance. But, it’s interesting news no matter how you slice it. I think many Apple fans would love for Apple to launch its own ISP, especially if it was dedicated to Apple’s existing commitment to privacy and security.

F8 Conference: App analytics, custom push notifications, Account Kit & more Home » Apps, developers, Facebook, Facebook F8, Internet, messaging, Mobile, Social Media Facebook F8 2017 Lowdown: Messenger 2.0, Workplace, AR Studio, Spaces By Salman SH ( @Sallu_SH ) on April 19, 2017 April 19, 2017 by Salman SH 00 At Facebook’s F8 developer conference held yesterday, the company introduced 4 major updates. The biggest updates were revealed for Messenger: Facebook has created a marketplace for bots. The social media giant is also betting big on virtual reality using its Oculus Rift platform and on enterprise networking with Facebook Workplace platform. Below is a lowdown Messenger updates Almost a year after opening Messenger bots to developers, Facebook is now adding more functionalities to its chat app. The company says that Messenger can now be used as a Telephone directory for finding new users and as a digital Yellow Pages book for finding new businesses and services. Here is how Facebook plans to do it: Discover tab: On the home screen of the Messenger app, a new discover tab will allow users to browse through bots, pages, companies, products, nearby places and events, News, etc. The ‘bot store’ feature is being rolled out in the US as of now. Any developer can add their own customized messenger bots to the platform. Messenger codes: The Messenger app now allow businesses and individuals to generate ‘parametric QR codes’. Whenever a Facebook users scans these QR codes, it will redirect them to a web page, an event page, etc. Messenger QR codes can also be customized for events like sporting games, concerts, etc. Advertisement Chat extensions: With this feature, users can invoke messenger bots within chat conversations—something which Google’s Allo has been doing using its Google Assitant feature. For example, within a chat conversation or a group, a Messenger user can share music tracks using the Spotify bot. The other users clicking on the music track will be redirected to the Spotify music bot within Messenger itself. Suggestions from M assistant and gaming: Facebook’s M assistant which was first released in November 2015 now gets directly integrated into Messenger app. Users can set reminders, make payments to other users, suggest tasks/businesses, order food, etc. The feature is currently available for US users only. There is also a new game tab for US users within messenger with support for multiplayer games. Updates on Workplace Facebook’s enterprise networking platform Workplace which was launched in October last year also gets some crucial updates. Workplace users can now share files, bots, compliance tools, etc. To start with, the platform will have file-sharing integration with Microsoft Office, Salesforce, etc. for quicker sharing. Files shared will have a thumbnail pic with description and a comments section—something which seems to be borrowed from Slack. Workplace will also have support for messenger bots. For example, the @repairbot can be used by a company’s employees to alert the maintenance team or a bot to remind employees about the daily work schedule. (Source: TechCrunch) The company claims to have already onboarded more than 1000 organisations worldwide who collectively have created 100,000 groups on the service as of October 2016. Top 5 countries using Workplace includes India, Norway, US, UK and France.  AR Studio for developers Facebook is now opening its augmented reality platform to developers. Developers can now employ image recognition technology to create camera effects, designs, code-driven animations, etc. The AR Studio is an augmented reality based development environment with features like face-tracking, 3D rendering, scripted effects among others. “With it, you can design effects that respond to motion, gestures, facial expressions and more,” the company said. These effects were introduced last month on Messenger and on the Facebook app, and resembles Snapchat’s well-known photo-filters. Facebook Spaces   The social media giant is betting big on Virtual Reality (VR) with its Facebook Spaces platform—a new VR app that allows users to hang-out with friends in a virtual environment. All users have their own customizable 3D avatar, and in order to use the Spaces, a user will require an Oculus Rift headset. A User can create a new chat room and invite more users. Once these users join the virtual space, they can perform actions like drawing in the air with a virtual marker, changing the VR background with 360-dgree photos, make video/phone calls via Messenger, etc. Note that the platform is currently in beta mode, while Facebook promises more updates in the future. 00 Related #Apps #developers #Facebook #Facebook F8 #Internet #messaging Related Facebook F8 roundup: Messenger as a platform, Parse for IoT and more After Google, Facebook debuts live location sharing on Messenger WhatsApp hits 900 million active users globally Google’s Instant Apps is now available to developers for beta testing Facebook opens bot development on Messenger; are apps irrelevant?

The company has also tied up with Airtel for providing 100 GB of data free to Airtel home users purchasing a Fire TV Stick. YOU Broadband subscribers will also get up to 240GB free data usage with 3 months validity. Note that Airtel has also tied up with Netflix for integrating video streaming onto its DTH boxes. Additionally, customers purchasing Fire TV Stick by May 31, 2017, will receive a ₹499 cash back to their Amazon Pay balance when they register for a Prime account. With this launch, the company is addressing a major gap in its Amazon Prime Video service: prior to the launch of the device, users had no option to view Amazon Prime Video on their TV sets. Apart from Sony TVs, Amazon doesn’t have Prime Video apps for any smart TVs, and has consciously avoided providing applications to competing devices like Roku and Chromecast. In comparison, Netflix, Hotstar, Gaana etc are available on whichever platform that users want them. However, a device playing Amazon Prime Video can still be cast to a device which accepts casting: I’ve done that with Amazon Prime on a Roku. Thus, Amazon Prime Video, especially with its fairly limited (but reasonably priced) content library, is not reason enough to buy Fire TV Stick, even though it is the only one of two (the other being a remote, which Roku also has), since all the other apps are available on most other platforms anyway. Advertisement Moreover, despite there having been comparisons with Google’s Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV Stick is no Chromecast: Fire TV Stick requires apps to be installed on it, in order to be played. Chromecast more than just a device: it allows users to cast apps, audio and video from their laptops, desktops and mobile phones to TV screens and speakers, which gives it a much larger scope than what Amazon Fire TV Stick allows: mirroring of a screen (which Chromecast also allows). In addition, there’s a massive ecosystem that Google has, of Chromecast enabled apps which allow streaming of music, news, and now with Google Assistant, the ability to search and play content and use services, with services and devices talking to each other. Outside of the Google services ecosystem, there’s a large base of developers enabling casting to Chromecast/casting enabled devices. Chromecast is more of a protocol. Amazon’s appears to be a more tightly controlled ecosystem, and while it is going in the same direction with Alexa, it’s not lost on us that Echo and Amazon Fire TV Stick don’t yet talk to each other. There is a Fire TV Stick remote with Alexa enabled, but to me, that seems to be the only advantage it has over Chromecast: the phone has other uses beyond controlling what is being cast, and we’re a multi-screen-multi-tasking generation. Still, given how aggressive Amazon is being in India, I won’t be surprised if Echo and/or Echo dot are launched in India before the year is out, while Google takes its own sweet time launching Home. Amazon is bullish in India Amazon has also been investing heavily in India; it recently received a wallet license from the RBI and has already diversified its business into sectors like grocery delivery, Video, and payments. Its core business segment, ecommerce, is already leading the market in terms of sales with a GMV of above $300 million as of August 2016, according to Forbes. In India, Amazon has invested close to Rs 2010 crore, with an overall commitment of Rs 7,000 crore in FY16. Speaking at a recent call with analysts, the company’s CFO Brian Olsavsky said “It (India) is still very early (market)… We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it’s delivery, whether it’s seller features. We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We’re bullish on India longer-term and it’s early.” Globally, Amazon’s net profit stood at $749 million in Q4 2016, up 197.2% from $252 million the preceding quarter and 55% from $482 million in the same quarter last year.

As far as I understand​ it. Its a very stupid Device that requires you to essentially broadcast everything from a Phablet. Where as the Fire / Android – Apple TV, Devices are all self contained, and can also handle direct streaming from such a Phablet Device if needs be. Either by Miracast, or Airplay. In the case of AndroidTV… Even Chromecast. But outside of Chromecast for Audio. Could someone please explain the value of Chromecast over say a Shield TV… Without bringing up that old Chestnut of price. Yes we all know the Chromecast is like 1/4 (or even less), of a Shield TV. That is not the answer I either need or want. Essentially the header of this Article (it would seem), intimates that the Fire TV fails at not being a Chromecast. Where as to me this would be an obvious plus.

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 26 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares101 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! TheScientists I'm kind of amazed someone hasn't already done this. It's the most basic of necessary functionality in an 'assistant'. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ So after posting this yesterday I looked into it, and sadly there's still no official API for creating reminders, and surprisingly no one has made an unofficial one either. So then I extracted the Inbox APK and decompiled it, I'm working my way through the code to see if I can't start pinning something down, but I'm betting they'll release actual support before I manage to do that. TheScientists Kudos to you, sir. I would have thought there would be something of note in the Google app apk? Or maybe some 1/2-assed way to do it via IFTTT. And, no, I wouldn't take that bet. Google is in no rush to do anything. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The problem is that the decompiled source doesn't exactly come across in a way that makes perfect sense. If a Java class isn't named in the manifest, it ends up getting somewhat obfuscated by proguard, so instead of seeing something like ReminderBuilder I end up with something named C12345, and even the classes are built in such a way that an object ends up being built up through multiple classes instead of just in a singular method, so it's complicated. I did look into IFTTT as well yesterday hoping for a quick solution but was disappointed. We'll see how far I get before either finding some options or just giving up out of frustration. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. dcdttu Once you can distinguish between users isn't all you need for reading/writing appointments....you've got to actually code that process, too. That's likely what they're doing now. So far in my testing at my house, it's quite good at knowing the different voices in our household. I wouldn't see their lack of confidence being a problem, honestly, because before the multi-user features were enabled, you could get personal information off Google Home for one user. Adding more than one user, even if it's giving the info to the wrong person, doesn't seem to be any worse. pfmiller My assumption was that they already have the code for writing data to their services since it's already done in every other application. That part of the problem isn't exactly novel. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! Jimjames Esson Well said,, Google to me ,if i have a Rheumotolgy appointment i simply use Google Calendar..!! Easy peasy lemon sqeasy..lol Blake What's an SRE? Petr Faitl I highly suspect that the answer is a highly political. No doubt it's product managers who can't agree with privacy gurus to prevent a few pranksters (i.e. one's kids) adding events to your calendar. abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Lars Jeppesen Who cares mustbepbs I do, because when I want to add a few minutes to a kitchen timer, I have to cancel the current one and create a new one with the new time. Kitchen timers from fuckin Dollar General have this "feature". abc He does. As he just said. Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. Ryan Music, pairing it with Smartthings to be a home controller, etc. I USED to use it for my shopping list, which was great. But they broke that function just recently. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. Lars Jeppesen I love mine - I'm sorry you can't figure out why it could be useful. Ryan I got mine on discount, so that helped. But I use it as a voice control for my smart-home features and to play music. JG What about Hangouts? I'm assuming since you said it can't yet write to the account, could it at least read my incoming Hangouts to me? davidofmidnight never forget... A re-review of Google Home, 7 months in. pic.twitter.com/N5bHZg2iTk— Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) March 20, 2017 trickytree1984 Support for exchange calendars is just as important. Most of the world don't use one personal Google calendar for their work and home life Navarr Barnier I'm assuming that MU was a blocker ticket, and they just pushed it out as quickly as they could - so reminders and appointments would be a WIP now that the blocker is out of the way. Surely.. right? right? Jonathan Sorry, but I just don't care about not having this feature, and I don't think many average users do either. But it wouldn't be a post about the Home if AP didn't gripe about it! Ryan Id use it daily, just like how I used the shopping list daily. Its a pretty basic feature that most people use (which is apparently by the unlimited competing choices for calendar and todo apps). Jonathan I agree that it's a basic feature that seems simple enough to execute and should have been implemented from the start​. I just don't think that many people are clamoring for it in their Bluetooth speaker outside of the AP sphere. And it's just getting silly and petty that the AP writers mention it in 95% of the articles they write​ about it. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The Home isn't just some Bluetooth speaker. It's SUPPOSED to be an assistive device that currently doesn't do the most basic tasks. I set reminders constantly across my phone, my watch, and in my car. It drives me crazy that I still can't do this on what is marketed as being the flagship device for Google Assistant. Ryan Or place items in Keep, like it used to be able to do. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I would love to be able to add items to ANY list in Keep. When my wife and I organize parties we use shared lists in Keep and it would be great to just add things as we talk about them. Stephen Cunningham I cant' get over Google taking the shopping list out of Keep. They are walking backwards not forward. I was hoping you would be able to add to any Keep list or add a note to Keep. Mike Jones i would like to add calendar appointments and i would like to add another minute to a timer too but that doesn't kill Home for me. i have a lot of home automation and i get a ton of use out of that. i just had a scare the other night where i thought i heard something in my house right as i was getting into bed. "google turn on the lights" and my house lit up like daytime.... it made it simple to check out the house.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the report notes that Apple has recently hired John Fenwick former lead of Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, who headed up satellite engineering at Google. Both now allegedly report to Greg Duffy, the Dropcam cofounder who joined Apple in January. Speculation on Duffy’s hire earlier this year suggested that he was “likely to be leading a special project at Apple that is operating like a startup within the company” but no further details were available at the time as to what such a project would be; the two most recent hires, however, suggest that Apple is pursuing another entirely new line of research and development. Fenwick and Trela are leading experts in the demanding and expensive field of satellite design and operation, generally representing work in the areas of image collection and communications. Bloomberg notes a regulatory filing last year where Boeing outlined a plan to provide broadband access through over 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit, and according to a person familiar with the situation, the aerospace company has allegedly spoken with Apple about being involved in that project, but it’s unclear if that’s directly related to this new special project, or even if those talks will result in any kind of a deal. However, according to a blog post by satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar, industry insiders at the annual Satellite 2017 conference recently reported that Boeing’s project was in fact being funded by Apple. Unlike Google, Apple has traditionally shown little interest in becoming a telecommunications provider of any kind, however Farrar and other consultants in the satellite industry have suggested that Apple may be looking to make a mark in an entirely new area of satellite internet, which is expected to each $30 billion in revenue by 2025. Companies such as Boeing are exploring solutions to provide lower latency and faster speeds at lower costs than existing cellular systems, which could revolutionize wireless communications. However, as Farrar points out, there’s still no guarantee that Apple will be involved int he Boeing project, as it remains a high risk industry “littered with bankruptcies and other failures.” It seems equally likely that Apple may have hired the new executives for their expertise in unrelated areas, such as imaging capture systems for its mapping platforms. Despite Fenwick and Trela’s background, they’re reporting to a lead who has consumer product and imaging experience, suggesting that their expertise may have been brought on board for less far-reaching plans. As a whole, the new hardware team led by Duffy still reports to Dan Riccio, Apple’s SVP of Hardware Engineering, the department traditionally focused on developing the iPhone, iPad, and Mac hardware, as well as Apple’s augmented reality efforts.

John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering have left the company for a new hardware team at Apple which reports to Greg Duffy, co-founder of Dropcam. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University. It's speculated that Apple could be looking to expand into satellite design and operation. One use for such technology would be a broadband service that could reach users who don't currently have Internet connectivity. It's also speculated that the executives could be working on a system to help Apple better collect mapping data, perhaps via the use of drones. Notably, rumors have suggested that Apple may be funding Boeing's V-band development work. Boeing has proposed a constellation of between 1,396 and 2,956 V-band satellites in 35-74 orbital planes at 1,200 km in altitude. The endeavor would create a global broadband system that would provide a wide range of advanced telecommunications services for commercial and governmental users.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Google to Build An Ad Blocker Into Chrome: Report Haamiz Ahmed 17 hours ago Following in Opera’s footsteps, Google is going to include their own ad blocker in Chrome. This was reported by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) which further stated that the ad blocker will be on by default in the popular web browser. Counterintuitive? It seems ironic as the search engine relies on ads for the majority of its revenue. The company made north of $60 billion through online ads in 2016. According to WSJ, Google is going to target specific kind of ads including pop-ups, auto-playing video and audio advertisements. If Chrome blocks the annoying kind of ads itself, users won’t need to get a 3rd party ad blocker. Google does not agree with making deals with the likes of Ad Block Plus to whitelist their own ads from their browser extension. Another reason for making their own ad block is a large number of users using Google Chrome. Most Popular Browser in The World Chrome is the most popular browser in the world and took the crown from the infamous Internet Explorer in 2016. It boasted a 56% market share compared with 21% of Internet Explorer. If that user base does not need to go for a 3rd party ad blocker and Google gets to show its own ads, it will be a win-win for both. Acceptable ads could gain traction which would benefit other advertisers as well. Not Confirmed Yet Of course, this kind of plan isn’t flawless by any means. Google is an advertiser and a major one at that. This would draw criticism from industry peers and antitrust watchdog organizations alike. WSJ says that it’s not really a done deal at this point but if Google does go ahead with it, it is going to break the news within the next few weeks. Google I/O is in mid-May and the company could make an announcement at the event. Only time will tell what the future holds for the online advertising industry.

Some Pixel phones are having problems with backups, Google is looking into it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 10:35am PDTApr 20, 2017 22 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares84 Bug Watch Google News Pixel Pixel XL Some users have been experiencing issues with backup on Google's Pixel devices, most notably backups of SMS, call history, and apps, although other accounts of all backup types failing have also been reported.  The current cause isn't known, but reports of the problem on Google's product forums stretch back to just after the launch of the device, and for many the matter remains unresolved. Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Syukri Lajin Google doesn't backup call history and sms. that's the only shitty part i have to complain about. JohnyNoLegs It does do SMS 100% as i just restored from a reset. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Killa Can you head into your Google Drive and look at the Backups for your Pixel? Is each content type separated out...like text, call history, etc.? Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

Chang Hi, I posted this, but it got kicked to bottom of thread. So, here it is again. Hope it is some help. Gen. Chang • 43 minutes ago Hi all, I wonder if this problem has occurred after any major updates? After I updated to Nougat, I had several issues, but after learning that resetting all app preferences from the app manager page, everything is working as it should. Better, in fact, than even my update to Marshmallow. By far, better Battery savings overnight now too. I wonder if a similar reset might help solve the back up issue for you. It erases all previous settings, but not data. And rebuilds those from scratch. Try turning off back ups, and turn off restore too. As that erases the previous version, then turn off, back on, to reboot. Then go back and turn on back up and restore, creating all NEW back ups. I would reset both app preferences, and erase and rebuild backed up data. This is the easiest thing to do, and not as damaging as a factory reset. Xchris Big deal. Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, that's one of you so far. abc "The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites" That's just sad for Android then. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7. Hexlattice On slower internet speeds, Photos has a really hard time trying to backup larger files... Normally, getting on a faster network will fix the problem, but if the files are old enough, it's like Photos gives up on trying and I end up having some videos never backup :( abc Pixel problems? https://i.imgflip.com/h8wog.jpg?a414600 Gen.

Praneeth Kancherla They have been looking into it from past few months. Backups on my Pixel XL never worked. I've contacted support through chat option on the phone and all information I got at the end is Google is aware of this issue,actively working on fixing it and fix will be available soon. It looks meaning of soon is certainly different​ in Google's dictionary. Lately my phone has developed so much lag even while doing simple tasks like using keyboard in any app, browsing internet and settings. Google support is okay to replace my device after verifying warranty but cannot ship replacement first even if I'm okay with hold on my credit card for full amount and covering shipping charges. They say replacement may take anytime from 7-10 business days and I need to buy another phone. The reason they quote is I'm not the original buyer. But they were able to verify and confirm that it's​ still under warranty. They are okay with honoring the warranty but not willing to ship replacement first even if I'm okay with covering charges that may incur in doing that. All these issues for $750 smartphone and they taking months to resolve issues without any possible workaround is just terrible in my opinion. I'll still use Pixel and Android as I like them compared to Apple and its ecosystem but I feel Google is certainly not doing enough to retain consumers like me.

It's the end of another week, filled with all sorts of thrilling announcements, spicy rumors, and delightful details from all over the tech world. As ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you're up to date with what's been happening. Our journey begins this week with Intel, which has announced the end of its Developer Forum, after almost two decades. AMD launched its new Radeon RX 500 family of graphics cards, built on the same 14nm Polaris architecture as last year's RX 400 series. In fact, they're so similar that an RX 480 can be upgraded to an RX 580 with a BIOS flash. Juicero attracted widespread derision for its $400 'smart juicer', which does little more than squeeze pre-made organic fruit and vegetable juices out of a bag and into a cup. The company is now offering refunds to buyers after it was pointed out that the same job could be done by hand. Good grief. Plastc, which aimed to offer a new type of credit card - that stored multiple card details on a single unit, and featured an e-ink display - shut down operations this week. Audio specialist Bose is facing a lawsuit, which claims that it collected users' audio histories, and shared that data with marketing companies along with personally identifiable data, alleging violation of the Wiretap Act and privacy laws. Facebook held its F8 developer conference this week, where it made a variety of announcements: Facebook wants to eventually replace passwords, starting with Delegated Account Recovery Two-new 360-degree cameras improve Facebook's focus on VR Research project aims to read your thoughts, and help people hear through their skin Can't wait to examine the privacy implications of that project. Mozilla released Firefox 53, ending support for older versions of Windows, adding new UI options, and introducing the new Quantum Compositor engine, which handles page rendering in a separate process. Perhaps the most surprising news of the week was about Firefox's biggest rival, Chrome. Google - which makes nearly all of its money from selling online ads - is reportedly planning to build its own ad-blocker into Chrome... but that's not quite as mad as it first seems. Google made its Home speaker hub a lot more useful, as it added multi-user support, using voice recognition to offer personalized features for up to six people. Google also launched a new version of Earth, its global exploration platform, introducing a range of features to help users learn more about our planet, and see it from all sorts of new perspectives. Weeks later than planned, Verizon said that its 4G-connected Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch, the Wear24, will finally be available next month. Google's Android Wear 2.0 rollout has been a bit of a mess. The company said that it will finally make its way to the last set of eligible devices by the end of May. The rollout of Android 7.0 Nougat hasn't been much better. Eight months after Google released that update, it's still slowly making its way to various devices: HTC One A9 in India Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge in India Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 and 9.7 in the US Google's Android security updates have also been rolling out to more devices: Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge on T-Mobile US (March update) Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 (April update) Samsung Galaxy S8+ in Europe (April update) ...and Google mistakenly pushed a "confidential internal" Android security update to some Pixel XL handsets. Oops. It hasn't been the best of weeks for Google's devices. It emerged that many Pixel and Pixel XL owners have been complaining of problems with backing up their data for months. Some Pixel and Nexus owners reported issues with the fingerprint sensors on their devices after installing the Android 7.1.2 update. And Google is also facing a class action lawsuit over bootloop and battery issues on its Nexus 6P. Samsung's new Galaxy S8 flagships, which are launching this month around the world, have also been making headlines in recent days: Users report a 'red hue' on their Galaxy S8 and S8+ displays Samsung is now preventing users from remapping the physical Bixby digital assistant button Galaxy S8 and S8+ get teardown treatment Galaxy S8 gets scratched, subjected to flames and a bend test Galaxy S8's battery survives being sliced and stabbed; spares the fireworks After it emerged that some owners of Huawei's new P10 and P10 Plus flagships were seeing wildly different memory performance on their devices, Huawei admitted that it has used a variety of memory chips on the handsets, but insists that it has not misled customers. Xiaomi unveiled its new top-of-the-line Mi 6 handset, featuring some killer specs at incredibly competitive prices. The device has a 5.15-inch screen, and uses Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor with 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage, priced from just $360. Sharp announced its new Aquos R, a compact flagship that also uses the Snapdragon 835. It features a 5.3-inch Quad HD display too, along with a 22.6MP camera, 4GB RAM, and 64GB storage. After seemingly endless leaks, HTC confirmed that its new U flagship will be unveiled on May 16. The device - which features touch-sensitive bezels - will be revealed just two months after its last flagship, the U Ultra, went on sale. Microsoft released a new beta of its Arrow Launcher for Android devices, bringing a range of minor, but useful new features. Microsoft also released a preview of its new "intelligent task management app" for Android phones, iPhones and Windows 10 devices. Promising a "smarter, more personal and intuitive way to help people stay organized", and integrated with Office 365, Microsoft To-Do will eventually replace Wunderlist, which the company acquired almost two years ago. Microsoft is also attempting to simplify two-factor authentication for those signing in to Microsoft accounts, enabling them to do so without a password, using its Authenticator app on iOS and Android... but not on Windows phones. What a surprise. Apple released its third developer betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5 Sierra, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. Apple also accidentally emailed hundreds of employees with a copy of a document that detailed workplace injuries to some of its staff, and which included possible hints at the company's future products. One incident referred to a user who "experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points" after testing an unknown prototype. Microsoft has been using iris-scanning technology for some time as part of its Windows Hello biometric authentication platform, but the company has now patented an enhanced version of that technology would could be used in future devices. Meanwhile, Microsoft is working with the UK's Lloyds Banking Group to enable customers of Lloyds Bank, Halifax, and Bank of Scotland to use Windows Hello fingerprint scanning and facial recognition when accessing their accounts. Expanding on its collaboration with Twist Bioscience and the University of Washington, Microsoft is acquiring another ten million strands of DNA to explore its potential for use in data storage. Microsoft is also acquiring Intentional Software, a company co-founded in 2002 by Charles Simonyi, one of its most distinguished former employees. Simonyi was a key figure in the development of Word and Excel, but left Microsoft to develop the Intentional Programming paradigm, which Microsoft is now interested in commercializing to help 'reinvent productivity'. Visual Studio 2017 Preview 15.2 was released this week, bringing various improvements and fixes for the developer community. Microsoft also announced a series of updates to Azure Analysis Services, its Online Analytics Processing engine, including improved integration with Active Directory, new pricing options, and more. Fujitsu unveiled a new range of Windows 10 PCs and tablets for enterprise, including one with a new 'Slide Passport' authentication system that will "read and authenticate the pattern of veins in your hand". And HP showed off its new family of mobile workstations, offering powerful performance and enterprise-class security. After unveiling its Galaxy Book at Mobile World Congress in February, Samsung announced details of pricing and availability in the US this week. The 10.6-inch Windows 10 tablet will be priced from $629.99, while the 12-inch model - which includes a 4G LTE option - will be available from $1,129.99. You can get a quick overview of the Galaxy Book 10.6" and 12" in our hands-on video. The Eve V, which the company's CEO described as a 'Surface killer' in an interview with Neowin last year, will go into production next week, and begin shipping from next month. The crowdsourced, crowdfunded device is similar in concept to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, but features the latest 7th-generation Intel processors, USB-C ports, and a keyboard that can be used without being physically connected to the device. Microsoft released new firmware for its Surface Pro 3 tablet, promising an improvement in system stability and performance "when you change between power states". Microsoft also released an update for its Surface Studio, allowing owners of the high-end Windows 10 all-in-one to wake the device simply by saying "Hey Cortana". Photos emerged of a prototype Lumia Windows device with ultra-slim bezels, running Windows Phone 8.1 - but it wasn't destined to be a high-end handset. Had that device been released, it probably wouldn't have had much impact on the dwindling fortunes of Microsoft's mobile platform. As Windows' share of the global smartphone market has all but disappeared, Microsoft recently announced plans to sell Samsung's Galaxy S8 Android flagship in its US stores. But it's not just happening in the US. In China, the Microsoft Store has now started selling the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus - and as with the Galaxy S8, it will come preloaded with Microsoft's apps. Months behind iOS and Android, Microsoft launched its Flow beta app for "Windows Phones" a couple of weeks ago. The app now appears to be out of beta, but Microsoft has since edited its earlier announcement to clarify that it's only for Windows 10 Mobile devices with at least 2GB of RAM. Over a week after OneDrive users reported problems syncing their files to and from Windows phones, the problem was resolved a few days ago. Next week, Microsoft will begin rolling out its Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update - but as it recently confirmed, just 13 handsets will officially be able to install that update, as the company is dropping support for older devices. Unsurprisingly, that outraged many Windows phone owners, but their anger deepened when Microsoft apparently disabled its Upgrade Advisor app, preventing any Windows Phone 8.1 device from upgrading to Windows 10 - including those devices that were previously eligible. But on Tuesday, the app started working again - and according to Microsoft's Jason Howard, the reason it stopped working in the first place was due to a "bug". It's not surprising that so many people assumed Microsoft had simply terminated that upgrade path, given its decision to end support for so many devices, and the fact that it recently split off Windows 10 Mobile from its main Redstone 3 development branch into a separate 'feature2' branch. After releasing build 15204 last week, Microsoft rolled out Windows 10 Mobile 'feature2' preview build 15205 to the Fast ring on Wednesday. The fixes and known issues for that build can be found here. On the same day, it released Windows 10 Redstone 3 preview build 16179 for PCs in the Fast ring. Microsoft previously made it clear that its early RS3 builds would focus on structural improvements to OneCore, so while there's not much in the way of new features, there are some fixes and known issues to be aware of. Also on Wednesday, Microsoft revealed that it had reintroduced Power Throttling in its most recent RS3 builds for PCs. That feature optimizes CPU usage to boost battery life on portable devices, such as tablets and notebooks. The next day, Microsoft revealed that its Redstone 3 update will be released in September, and said that the company is now aligning Windows 10's two-updates-per-year release cadence with Office 365 ProPlus. Microsoft announced further changes to Office 365 ProPlus, including extended support for each feature update, revisions to system requirements, and a range of new tools to help manage application compatibility. Next month, Microsoft is hosting an event at which it's expected to formally announce its new Windows 10 Cloud edition. 'Recommended minimum specifications' for devices running that new version of the OS were revealed this week. In December, Microsoft announced that it would bring the full version of Windows 10 to devices with next-generation ARM processors, capable of running x86 apps through emulation. Qualcomm's CEO said this week that 'Mobile PC' devices with its Snapdragon 835 chips are scheduled to launch in the fourth quarter of 2017. Microsoft is adding new features to its Windows 10 Mail and Calendar apps for Gmail users, which were previously available only for those who used Outlook and Office 365. The Xbox Insider Hub app, previously exclusive to Xbox One consoles, is coming to Windows 10 PCs. Microsoft announced details of its next update, Version 1705, for the Xbox One and One S, including several fan-requested features. The latest build, 15063.3022, is now available for Xbox Insiders in the Alpha Ring. The latest Xbox Games with Gold were revealed, which will include Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II next month. Two years after its PC debut, Cities: Skylines is now available on the Xbox One. You can see the launch trailer for the Xbox One edition here. Halo Wars: Definitive Edition was released on Thursday as a standalone purchase for the Xbox One, and for PCs via the Windows Store and Steam. A new racing mode is coming to Grand Theft Auto Online, which will be familiar to those who played GTA back in the ol' days. The top-down view in Tiny Racers will be a nostalgia-fuelled thrill ride for many players, and frankly, it looks like enormous fun - make sure you check out the launch trailer here. It's official: the next instalment in the hugely popular Call of Duty series will take the series back to its World War II roots - and we'll learn more about the new game next week. The official trailer for Star Wars Battlefront II was released this week, ahead of the game's release on November 17. That's a long time to wait...! Sony announced on Tuesday that it will now be offering double the storage on its PlayStation 4 Slim in the US and Canada, for the same price of $299.99. Until now, the console has only been available in North America with 500GB of storage. Our odyssey across the tech world ends on a note of excitement - particularly after last week's disappointment, when Nintendo confirmed that it was no longer making its wonderful NES Classic Edition console. But as it turns out, it might just be preparing to launch a new version of the SNES... Squeeeee! Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading.

Voice assistants are everywhere. They're in our phones, speakers, washing machines, and now, cars. Mercedes-Benz has announced that both Alexa and Google Assistant will work on all of its 2016 and 2017 models released in the US. Apart from a compatible car, you will need an active Mercedes Me account and a subscription to mbrace, Mercedes' smartphone platform in the US that costs $199 a year after a six-month free trial. Google Home review: Better than Amazon Echo? What is Google Assistant and how does it work? 7 best Google Home compatible devices you can buy today So, starting 21 April, owners of newer Mercedes can command their Google Home or Amazon Echo to remotely start or lock their vehicles. They can also send addresses to their in-car nav system. In its announcement, Mercedes explained how the integration works: "Customers with Google devices can simply say, 'Ok, Google, tell Mercedes me to start my car,' and it will remotely start the customer’s car. Another available feature includes remote lock. With Alexa devices, customers can say, 'Alexa, ask Mercedes me to send an address to the car' for remote navigation input and point-of-interest requests." And here's a promo video that shows the integration in action: Mercedes first revealed that in December 2016 that it would soon support Google Assistant on Google Home. The company has also said that Europe will get these same features in the near future.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back.

TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it.

I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

Boeing laid out a plan to provide broadband internet access through over 1,000 low-earth orbiting satellites in a 2016 regulatory filing, and a source “familiar with the matter” told Bloomberg that Apple spoke with the aerospace company about coming an investor-partner in the project. Further, TMF Associates satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar wrote in a recent blog post that industry insiders said Boeing’s project was being funded by Apple at the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. Farrar noted that a Wall Street Journal article reported that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025, showing the potential of the field. One of the major lures for tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook to develop broadband internet is to tap into the large demographic of people who don’t yet have internet access, notes Bloomberg. Facebook has long espoused this goal. The report also states that Apple might be putting its satellite experts to work on something else closely related — such as drones or near space technology like high bandwidth radio transceivers or high-altitude balloons. Whatever it is, however, likely has its home in the sky.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

Earth Day Google doodle offers up conservation tips to help save the planet Google is using today's doodle to promote conservation efforts and support the World Wildlife Fund, The Ocean Agency, and The Jane Goodall Institute. Amy Gesenhues on April 21, 2017 at 5:52 pm More While the official date for Earth Day is April 22, Google has posted its 2017 Earth Day Google doodle a day early. To celebrate this year’s Earth Day, the Google doodle team has created a slide show of animated images reminiscent of a children’s book. Designed by doodler Sophie Diao, the illustrations tell the story of a fox dreaming about a world with polluted oceans and suffering through the adverse impact of climate change. Upon waking, the fox begins to make small changes during his day that lead to greater energy-conservation efforts. Google shared the following sketches of the doodle in its early stages: Clicking the search icon on the doodle leads to a search for “Earth Day tips” and surfaces an interactive tool that includes a collection of Earth Day tips, along with information about the conservation efforts currently underway by the World Wildlife Fund, The Ocean Agency and The Jane Goodall Institute. “Today, we honor the rich, vast Earth that’s sustained generations before us and continues to nurture life and inspire wonder,” writes the Google Doodle team on its blog, “At an estimated 4.543 billion years of age, the Earth is still the only known object in the Universe known to harbor life.” Google’s Earth Day doodle is being shared across the globe — posted on its US and international home pages.

Name: Subject: Message: Google removes fake “System Update” app from Play Store Newsby John Callaham5 hours ago 10 708 29 Even though the Google Play Store is by far the safest place to download apps for your Android smartphone or tablet, there’s always the danger of installing one that is not what it claims to be. Recently, Google removed such an app from the Play Store that was labeled as “System Update”. In fact, the app was spyware that had been downloaded millions of times in the past few years. See also: Best security apps for Android 2 weeks ago The security firm Zscaler claims it discovered that this “System Update” app, which first launched in 2014, was spyware that sent data about a device’s location to whomever created the app. It also can look at certain incoming SMS messages. The security firm says that if a user installed and tried to use the app, it would appear to quit working and show the message, “Unfortunately, Update Service has stopped.” In fact, there is evidence the app would continue to work in the background. The firm alerted Google to this fake app, and the company has since removed it from the Play Store, but not before the listing’s page indicated it had been downloaded between 1 million and 5 million times. It goes without saying that all Android device owners should be careful when downloading any app from the Play Store. In this case, there were clues that “System Update” was a fake. There were no screenshots posted in its Play Store listing, and there was no proper description of the app. Finally, written reviews in the listing were highly negative, as many users stated the app didn’t work.

 Google car spin-off says Uber is involved in a 'cover up' and is 'hiding a device' Biz Carson Apr. 21, 2017, 8:32 PM 5,679 facebook linkedin twitter email print Travis Kalanick, chief executive officer of Uber Technologies Inc., speaks during the Institute of Directors (IOD) annual convention at the Royal Albert Hall in London, U.K., on Friday, Oct. 3, 2014. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images Uber's star engineer Anthony Levandowski was "enticed" to copy valuable technology from Google and is now involved in a "cover up" to hide a device based on that technology, according to a new legal filing by Google's self-driving car unit Waymo. The device in question is a Lidar unit, the radar sensor that self-driving cars use to map their surroundings.  Uber allowed Waymo to inspect two Lidar devices after it was sued in February for allegedly stealing Waymo's Lidar design.  But Waymo now says there is an entirely different version of the device that Uber is hiding somewhere.  In a court filing on Friday, Waymo claims that it found evidence that Uber has "misrepresented" its Lidar designs to the court after it deposed several Uber engineers who admitted to having a second prototype. Uber's case so-far has been to argue that its Lidar design, nicknamed Fuji, is entirely different from Waymo's.  An excerpt from a court deposition shows an Uber engineer admitting to a second prototype Lidar. Court filing While Waymo contends that Uber has another Lidar unit, an Uber spokesperson told Business Insider that the initial concept never even made it to the point where it could have infringed on a patent and it was never a device or a secret. Furthermore, the abandoned design is not the one Uber is currently developing for use on its self-driving cars, an Uber spokesperson said.  Banned Waymo wants Levandowski, a former Google engineer who now runs to Uber's self-driving car program, to be banned from running the unit that he remains in charge of to this day. A hearing for the preliminary injunction is scheduled for May 3. "Uber has taken, copied, and used Waymo's technology," Waymo's lawyers wrote in the heavily-redacting filing. "This, along with Uber's subsequent cover-up and violations of this Court's orders, shows the need for an injunction in this case." The trade-secrets case is shaping up to be one of the most significant and closely watched battles in Silicon Valley in years, pitting two of the world's most powerful companies, and former partners, against each other. Levandowski, who was also deposed by Waymo, took the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination on every question except six basic questions about his name and education.

Google Maps v9.51 beta adds new details about parking, prepares to improve route planning with parking suggestions and traffic charts [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 11:17am PDTApr 21, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares113 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 New parking indicators 2 Teardown 2.1 Change your route to nearby parking 2.2 Traffic Histogram 3 Download It's time for another update to Google Maps. Like so many other version bumps, this one includes a couple of great gifts to get users where they want to go. The focus of this release appears to be directed at parking. There are now indicators to show if there is on-site parking and whether it's free or paid. The theme continues into the teardown with a feature that will help drivers plan to find parking near their destination before getting there. If you're already signed up to the beta, this update might already be waiting for you. Otherwise, you can hit the link at the bottom to download the apk. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Free / Paid indicator for parking on detail pages Destinations now show if there is on-site parking New parking indicators Google has been on a roll with parking-related features since they were introduced earlier this year. The latest update digs a bit deeper to inform drivers about the parking situation before getting to a destination. The first addition can be found in the details page, which indicates if parking at that location is free or paid. As the screenshot shows, the line can be found just below the address in most cases. However, parking details aren't available for very many locations yet, so you probably can't count on seeing it at most destinations. At this time, the field only shows if parking is free or paid, but doesn't appear to include prices for paid parking. To get prices, you'll probably still have to resort to other methods. Perhaps this will be added in a future update like it was with fuel prices. Left: previous version. Right: latest version. (Look for the red and blue markers.) The other adjustment comes in the form of a new type of parking difficulty indicator. In previous versions, Maps would show one of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Limited. The latest update adds On-site to the mix, which shows drivers if they can park at their destination or plan to search for a spot nearby. Unfortunately, this change does introduce something of a regression in usability. As the screenshots above show, the on-site indicator replaces the difficulty marker. If parking happens to be fairly terrible at your destination, you'll have no idea about that until you're driving around with no hope of finding an available space. Considering how much effort has gone into assessing parking difficulty, this will probably be fixed fairly soon. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Change your route to nearby parking Navigation apps are great for getting us to a place, but most of them have been designed with a bit of intentional tunnel vision. We might say we want to go to some place, but what we really mean is that we have to drive to a slightly different place to park, then walk (or whatever) to the real destination. The Google Maps developers are working to address this common scenario and help drivers make the decision to reroute to nearby parking. New text in the apk describes a feature that will prompt users to add a parking lot to their routes. Basically, it will offer to search for parking lots and garages near the destination and offer up a list. Users will then be able to pick a parking location, which will then be added to the route. code <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING">Adds the parking lot to the route.</string> <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING_LONG">Adds %1$s as a parking lot on the route</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING_NEAR_DESTINATION">Find parking near destination</string> <string name="ADD_PARKING">Add parking</string> <string name="EDIT_PARKING">Edit parking</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING">Find parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_QUERY">Parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_FAILED">Can't search</string> <string name="NO_PARKING_LOTS_FOUND">Can't find any parking lots or garages near there</string> <string name="PARKING_NEARBY_DESTINATION">near %1$s</string> Based on the wording, I assume the parking location will be placed immediately before the destination instead of replacing it, which makes sense if you need walking directions after parking the car. On the subject of walking, search results will be presented with an estimate of how long it will take to walk from a parking area to the final destination. <string name="SEE_MORE_PARKING_OPTIONS">See more options</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_GREATER_THAN_ONE">+%1$s walk</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_LESS_THAN_ONE"><1 min walk</string> There seems to be one catch: The parking recommendations seem to be incompatible with routes involving multiple stops. I doubt there's a technical reason these two features can't coexist, so it's probably a decision to avoid building an overcomplicated interface. <string name="PARKING_NOT_SUPPORTED_MESSAGE">Parking was removed because it's not supported for multiple stops</string> Overall, I think this is going to be a great addition and will save a lot of people from the pattern of first driving to a place and then driving in circles for another 15-20 minutes desperately searching for parking. Traffic Histogram For many years, Google has been able to tell us with bewildering accuracy just how long a drive should take. This isn't just a matter of calculating distance and speed limits, but also making estimates based on established traffic patterns. While it's nice to get an idea of the total time, some drivers certainly want to know if part of their trip is going involve slowly creeping through nearly standstill traffic. Google is working to put that information in front of users with a chart of anticipated traffic density throughout a drive. The string below spells out the concept pretty clearly. <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_TRAFFIC_TREND_BAR_CHART">A time-series histogram showing how much traffic is on your route today.</string> There's next to zero information beyond the string below, but I would expect the histogram to look like the busyness chart introduced late last year, but with shorter time increments – maybe every 10 or 15 minutes. Most people will probably see this as a "nice to know" type of feature, but it could be a life saver for drivers that get panicky in heavy traffic, or at least a useful tool for road trippers. I know I'd like to get a good look at traffic in a few spots before driving down to the Bay Area next month.

Google Maps v9.49 beta adds a manual parking location tracker, weather indicator for mass transit navigation, and more [APK Download + Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/03/18 10:49am PDTMar 18, 2017 112 Plus 1 on G+ 123 Share on Facebook 88 Share on Twitter Total Shares323 Android Auto APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Save your parking location 1.2 Weather in mass transit navigation 1.3 Updated arrival screen on Android Auto 2 Teardown 2.1 Sort your searches 3 Download It's always good to see useful new features in the apps we use often, and Google Maps rarely fails to bring something new with every update. The latest bump to v9.49 is no different. This release adds a few new toys for users to enjoy. There's a new capability to manually save your parking location so it's easier to get back to your car, weather predictions for your destinations while setting up navigation, and more. There's even a quick teardown that shows search results will soon support sorting. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Save your parking location along with notes, pictures, and expiry reminders Notification toggle for mass transit station notifications Weather predictions at destination New arrival screen on Android Auto Save your parking location Google has spent the last couple of years working on fine-tuning a system that will try to accurately detect when you finish driving and remember where you parked. While it's definitely helpful, it's not entirely reliable and doesn't do much to make multi-level parking structures any easier. However, the latest version adds a feature to save your parking location for easy reference. To access this handy tool, you'll have to tap on the blue dot that indicates your current location. This pops up a menu with the command to save your parking. Tapping on it will instantly record your location and place it on the map. From here, you can look at the detail page and manually adjust the location, add notes to describe things like the parking level or lot/row numbers, set a time limit, and add photos. There's even a share button if you want to let somebody else know where your car is located. When you're ready to return to your car, you can find the saved location in your notifications or at the top of the suggestions on the search screen in Google Maps. Being able to add notes and photos is obviously helpful in certain situations, and it's enough to make this feature useful. But it also includes a field where you can set a time limit. This is clearly intended for use with situations like metered street parking and time-limited spaces. The time limit will even count down to show how long until it expires, or how long it has been expired. If you're not interested in getting notifications about time limits that are about to expire, you can switch them off in Settings. This is a pretty great feature and allows for manual control, which matters quite a bit considering Google's automatic detection can be off by as much as a couple of blocks sometimes. The one problem that stands out to me is that you can only ever set one parking location at a time. This means you're probably not going to be able to leave your car in long-term parking at the airport, fly somewhere else, then keep track of the location of your rental car. Maybe this will be remedied at some point in the future, but in the meantime, Google Keep remains a pretty good stand-in. Weather in mass transit navigation Google Maps is a multi-facetted tool and packs quite a bit of information into every screen, but the v9.49 update might add just a little bit extra when you're planning to travel. Some users have reported seeing a new weather indicator while preparing navigation. There are a couple of odd things about this weather report. To begin with, it seems to only show up while planning trips on mass transit, not with any of the other forms of conveyance. On top of that, it shows weather at your current location, not at the destination, which flies in the face of most methods of travel. I have a theory that may explain this. Since most types of public transportation involve at least some period of time standing outside waiting for a train, bus, or car to come along, it might help to give people a reminder of what conditions they'll be standing in. The weather indicator doesn't seem to be available for all users yet, so you may not see this immediately. Updated arrival screen on Android Auto Android Auto users haven't been forgotten, there's a new arrival screen appearing for some. This change was first reported last week with v9.48, but again, it doesn't seem to be live for everybody. (I didn't have it on v9.48, and I've been too sick to try it since.) The new arrival card somewhat resembles the updated version that came with v9.45 early last month, which includes trip duration, distance, and average speed in a single row. For reference, the previous version is included below. – Thanks Craig and Mike. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Sort your searches Most standard searches in Google Maps will yield some pretty satisfactory results. The list of possible destinations will be sorted based on how long it would take to reach each one from your current location – and that's probably how most of us actually want it to work. However, there are also times when we're surrounded by places that show up in a search, but aren't actually what we're looking for. It looks like the Maps app might allow us to refine the search experience a bit by changing the sorting method. <string name="SEARCH_SORT_BY">Sort by</string> <string name="SEARCH_SORT_RELEVANCE">Relevance</string> There's obviously not much to say here since there are only two strings and they spell it out pretty clearly. There's going to be an option to change sorting methods, and at this time, the only option mentioned is relevance. I would expect travel time and distance to be added to the list, and possibly a few others. It's not clear yet if the sorting options will appear in the screen for setting more filters or in another location.

PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Must.integrate.Waze.into.Android Auto.now. KChristainsen Nothing new on Google plus location integration? Bala kumar Speedometer and Speed Limit are two much needed features which are still missing ... whispy_snippet A speedometer isn't needed because every car already provides this. It's redundant info that would only clutter the app's UI. A speed limit indicator is a different matter though. I'd love to see this added. Bala kumar Speed limits are also there in the Road signs and won't required in the app, you mean? It is not that the speedometer is there in the car or not. What would you say, if I'm a co-passenger and like to see the speedometer? Why not? whispy_snippet Road signs are only visible as you pass them whereas a car's speed is always visible. This is stating the obvious. Adding a second speedometer to a car is pointless and just adds clutter and another possibility for distraction. If the passenger wants to see the speed of the car they only need to look at the driver's speedo. Adding a speed limit indicator, however, makes sense because it's very easy to miss a speed limit sign. Having the speed limit always visible is helpful. Having two displays of a car's current speed is not. ekerazha GPS-based speedometer is more accurate. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I agree, sometimes when you change roads, you dont see the Road signs anywhere near you, that happens very often in rural-country roads or when it's dark at night and the signs roads are difficult to spot. GPS-based speedometer is very handy in those mentioned situation, besides, another handy feature is you can set up an audible alert is you pass the speed limit which happens more often that we want. Pessimippopotamus It's handy, but you *should* be paying attention to roadside signage all the time instead of relying on a nav app anyway. I wonder if Google won't put it in the app on purpose because if one speed limit is off, then they'd be in a potential legal trouble. Yuri Vidal How to Register for beta? andy_o Hmm I didn't realize Android Auto in cars already had an arrival screen. Been wishing for that in the standalone app for a while now. Hopefully with the wide rollout of the new one it will come to it as well, and the parking functionality, which for now I have to open Maps manually for. drvadlamudi Still waiting for the migration of the location sharing function to maps. waloody88 Wow unreal. After all the bloat streak something good was finally added. Few more useful features and i may enable Google maps again. p g 2 things I would like to see in maps.. as a truck driver.. first low clearance over passes or restricted roads. Also I agree with another person that posted about road speed limits. Signage ain't always that great. dariusmoss how long has maps been remembering your settings when choosing to avoid tolls or highways? because i just noticed that FINALLY being implemented andy_o I just noticed it today too. There's another person in the Maps Google product forums that reported it too. Must be the feature update of the decade for Google, and no one's reporting it! whispy_snippet I really do love Google Maps. An absolute day to day essential. A true game changer that never stops getting better. Cecil Hardwood Love me some Google Maps and this feature is nice. I like the option to take a photo and notes about your parking spot. Nice job Google. pfmiller I use Valet for parking, and the ability to automatically remember your location when you disconnect from your cars Bluetooth is brilliant. patkoscsaba Hmm... I have this version installed, but I don't see the parking option. Is it location related? andy_o Not sure if others still have it, but for me it was disabled after a day or so. Probably server-side switch. Dharshan Wimal Hi, I saw am a Sri Lankan guy where a I saw a Sri Lankan app which has the similar feature that is going to be released on the google map.

Chrome 58 improves Custom Tabs and Progressive Web Apps, breaks sites using certain HTTPS certificates, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 7:05am PDTApr 21, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares141 Applications Downloads Google News Article Contents 1 Improvements to Chrome Custom Tabs 2 Distrusting all WoSign and StartCom certificates 3 Removal of old New Tab Page UI 4 Changes to Progressive Web Apps 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 58 was just released on the desktop a few days ago, and in speedier fashion than usual, Chrome 58 for Android is now available. This update focuses on improvements to Chrome Custom Tabs and Progressive Web Apps, includes dozens of minor improvements, and blocks HTTPS/SSL certificates from certain certificate providers. Improvements to Chrome Custom Tabs Google has been working on Chrome Custom Tabs quite a lot recently. In the last update, Custom Tabs gained almost all the functionality of normal Chrome tabs, such as finding text in the page and adding sites to the home screen. However, links in Custom Tabs were still pretty limited. Holding down on a link would only reveal options to copy the link or download it. Thankfully, Chrome 58 addresses this by adding more functions, such as the ability to open the link in a new Chrome tab.   Left: Chrome 57; Right: Chrome 58 With this change, there really isn't any differences (as far as functionality goes) between normal Chrome tabs and Custom Tabs. Distrusting all WoSign and StartCom certificates When you see the green lock icon and the word 'Secure,' that means that the site you're viewing has a valid SSL certificate. These certificates are provided by Certificate Authorities, which have the responsibility of verifying ownership of a given site before issuing a certificate for it. Before you scroll down to the next section because this sounds boring, stay with me, because this is where the craziness begins. Back in October, Google called out WoSign for issuing a certificate for one of GitHub's domains - without GitHub's authorization. In layman's terms, WoSign gave away a key to GitHub's house without asking GitHub's permission. As you can imagine, that didn't go over too well. Google conducted an investigation into WoSign's business practices, and found that the company had "knowingly and intentionally misissued certificates in order to circumvent browser restrictions and CA requirements." In addition, StartCom (which was previously bought by WoSign) had basically been completely absorbed into WoSign - despite StartCom repeatedly saying otherwise. An example of an SSL certificate error. Due to the damage that WoSign and StartCom's certificates could do, Google started distrusting all of their certificates issues after October 21, 2016 with Chome 56 (and Mozilla did something similar). However, starting with Chrome 58, Chrome will not trust any WoSign and StartCom certificates at all. So if you see security warnings on sites you visit with Chrome 58, they may have been using certificates from those two companies. Removal of old New Tab Page UI You may recall that back in Chrome 54, Google changed the New Tab Page to add suggested articles. The new design removed the Bookmarks and Recent Tabs buttons, which annoyed some users. Thankfully, you could go back to the old design fairly easily. However, one the the flags required to disable the new design (#enable-ntp-snippets) has been removed in Chrome 58. We first spotted this in the Chrome 58 Beta, so this isn't unexpected, but still unfortunate. You can still remove the suggestions by disabling #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions, but the Bookmarks and Recent tabs buttons do not come back. Changes to Progressive Web Apps If you're not aware, Progressive Web Apps are web applications that behave like native apps. They can push notifications, share content to other Android apps (and receive shared content), and even have their own icons in the app drawer. Further blurring the line between native and web apps, Chrome 58 gives PWAs the ability to go full-screen. By adding "display: fullscreen" to the web app's manifest, PWAs opened from the home screen/app drawer will hide the status bar and (if applicable) software navigation bar. In addition, Progressive Web Apps launched from the home screen/app drawer now have the ability to autoplay video unmuted. On normal sites, Chrome on Android automatically mutes any auto-playing video. Other features As with every Chrome release, there are several smaller features that are worth briefly mentioning. Here are a few of them. Web sites can now customize Chrome's native media controls with the new ControlsList API. If you're using an Android device with a mouse, clicking inside web pages will register MouseEvents in the page instead of TouchEvents. Basically, web sites will know you're using a mouse instead of a touch screen. Sites can now use the CSS color-gamut media query to detect the approximate range of colors supported by Chrome and the device it's running on. Chrome 58 supports trailing commas in Javascript, for parameter and argument lists. Non-HTTPS sites can no longer display notifications with the Notifications API. Navigating to data: URLs in tabs (doesn't apply to content embedded in the page) is no longer supported. I'm actually incredibly glad Google has done this, because it has been recently used in many phishing scams - like this one. Chrome 58 supports IndexDB 2.0. You can read more about the improvements here. The Autofill page in Chrome settings has been renamed to 'Autofill and Payments.' APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

I especially hope they don't decide to remove the feature later because I've gotten so used to it already. Borgman Have you had any problems with bottom omnibox in chrome beta? Specifically when opening an incognito tab? (I tried twice and turned it off because incognito didn't work for some reason, roughly 2-3 weeks ago). I'd open a tab with incognito, type in the box to search something, hit search, but then it opened/searched in the regular non-incognito tab. Corbin Davenport I've been using Chrome Dev for a few weeks now with the bottom omnibox, incognito tabs seem to work fine. Borgman Is Dev fairly stable compared to beta?! I've thought about downloading it, but was rather nervous! Corbin Davenport It's been pretty stable for me, actually. Borgman That's good to hear! I might give it a try then! Nate I'm on the beta and can't find a setting or flag for this. How did you do that? Corbin Davenport I'm not sure if it has reached Beta yet, but this post explains how to enable it: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/20/chromes-experimental-chrome-home-interface-now-bottom-tabs-revamped-new-tab-page/ pfmiller That looks great, I guess I'll hold off updating until that is released since I don't want to lose my NTP recent tabs button. Why does Google always remove features before their replacement is ready, it's ridiculous. Tomáš Petrík I, for one, am sad not to be able to use the data: URL anymore. If I happened across a base64 encoded image, I could simply paste the data in the address bar, prepend it with the necessary stuff and I could see the image right away. Madis Where would you happen to come across one, though? The only good applications for that I know of are userscripts and userstyles. Tomáš Petrík Sometimes in a corrupted email, or in the source code of some plugin, etc. There are situations when I used the ability. Not many of them, but there are. Taomyn The WoSign and StartCom were actually blocked starting Chrome v57 on all platforms - I had to convert a few sites to use Let's Encrypt when it happened.

Michael Hazell My guess is that they have some widgets/plugins on the site that are hard-coded to load things over HTTP. That, and back-end load concerns, although this is more of a thing of the past with the latest cipher suites. For a long time, even Disqus used to be a barrier. Kavan Trivedi Is this something new?? Any1 else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d9529f329ebbfb0f262209d944e48bb75217db79cbdc1e9af42760cfccdeeeb1.png Corbin Davenport Yep, that's new. Blake DeVoss I want nothing more than to disable Custom Tabs system-wide. Adam Margeson They have their uses, but at the same time I find myself agreeing with you. At the very least, it would be a nice option to have. F4LL0U7 Am I the only one who hates Chrome custom tabs? I have to turn them off in every f'ing app I install now. I wish there were a way to disable them across the board. I just want my web links to open in a web browser, so that I can keep the website open and still be able to go back to the app without closing the site. Is that so much to ask? Jordan L I'm with you on this. I don't like when apps open the webpage inside the app. I turn ON 'open webpages in external browser' when I can. F4LL0U7 Why are they forcefully removing our only way to get bookmarks & recents back on the new tab page? Seems like a purposefully bad UX. C Scott Willy AP missed a huge bug fix in 58. See https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/chrome-firefox-and-opera-users-beware-this-isnt-the-apple-com-you-want/ I confirm that going to https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com/ made it look like you were going safely to https://www.apple.com/. This was on Chrome 57. I confirmed it is fixed on Chrome 58. Hopefully Opera and Firefox have fixes soon.

Last quarter, Alphabet’s GOOGL, -0.13% GOOG, +0.18%   earnings fell short of expectations largely due to tax charges, including one charge tied to its stock-based compensation plan that shaved roughly 83 cents a share off non-GAAP earnings. While announcing those results, Alphabet execs announced the company will begin to emphasize GAAP earnings as opposed to non-GAAP, which allow companies to use accounting gymnastics to exclude stock- based compensation and one-time charges that may have been incurred during the quarter. Read Also: The tax hit that made Google miss on earnings, and the big change that will keep it from happening again On the company’s earnings call in January, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, a Wall Street veteran who previously led the finance department at Morgan Stanley, said the company was changing its accounting metrics because it no longer wanted to exclude stock-based compensation, or SBC, from its results. Alphabet will still break down stock-based compensation on its cash flow statement for investors who prefer to look at results without it, but the company will present the GAAP figure as its main earnings result. “Although it’s not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world,” Porat said. MarketWatch has been covering the complicated world of GAAP vs. non-GAAP earnings for years. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has promised to start cracking down on made-up numbers this year, though many companies still rely on non-GAAP results. Also See: How investors are duped each earnings season Alphabet’s results for the second quarter will be closely watched for any negative results from a controversy for YouTube, which saw advertisers pull spending after news reports showed ads running on objectionable videos. Any effects may be hard to spot, however, as Google’s results for search and other advertising are combined with YouTube results, which have never been presented separately. YouTube's Viewership Could Soon Overtake TV(1:46) YouTube viewers world-wide are now watching more than 1 billion hours of videos a day, boosted by algorithms personalizing user lineups. The number represents a ten-fold increase from 2012. Photo: Getty Images Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to report GAAP earnings per share of $7.39, compared with $7.50 in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items that occurred during the quarter, the non-GAAP metric Alphabet has focused on in the past, analysts are calling for earnings of $9.41 a share. Estimize, a software platform that pools together estimates from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expects Alphabet to report earnings $8.57 a share. The Estimize number is usually closer to the FactSet non-GAAP number, but this quarter is different because it reflects a wide spectrum of contributors who may be issuing a mix of forecasts based on Google’s previous and newer financial reporting standards. Estimize Chief Executive Leigh Drogen told MarketWatch that the platform’s algorithms are offsetting that by overweighting the newer estimates, but the old estimates are still skewing it. Alphabet missed both the FactSet and Estimize consensus earnings estimates last quarter, but surpassed them in the two prior quarters. Revenue: Alphabet is expected to report revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, of $19.8 billion, compared with $16.5 billion in the year-earlier period, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Estimize contributors predict Alphabet sales of $19.7 billion. Alphabet topped both estimates in each of the past three quarters, and analysts continue to be optimistic about advertising trends despite the YouTube controversy. The Google division of Alphabet is dominated by advertising revenues, though the development of its “other revenues,” which include hardware sales like the Pixel smartphone and Google Play Store revenue, will be interesting to watch after 62% growth last quarter. Alphabet also breaks out “other bets,” a segment that includes its experimental lines of businesses. Read also: Android projected to top Apple in app revenue for first time this year Stock reaction: Shares of Alphabet have performed in-line with the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  since the company’s last earnings report, as both have increased about 3.5% in the past three months. Alphabet’s shares have gained about 10% in the past year, while the S&P is up 12%. Analysts have been mixed on where they think the stock is headed in the next year. While the vast majority of analysts recommend buying the shares, Alphabet was downgraded to market perform at BMO Capital Markets earlier this month due to fears that Google was facing fiercer competition from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.39%  The BMO analysts cut their price target on the stock to $880 from $1,005. Other analysts, however, believe Alphabet’s best is still to come. Last week, Credit Suisse reiterated a $1,100 target and outperform rating on the stock and said investors may be underestimating the potential benefits of its newer business lines, such as YouTube TV, Google Play and the cloud. Read: Alphabet’s stock may finally outperform Facebook and Amazon The average analyst rating is the equivalent to buy, according to a FactSet survey of more than 30 analystsm who have an average price target of $982.26. Shares closed at $858.95 Friday. What to watch for: Analysts have been forecasting an in-line quarter for Google, though some have warned that profit growth may be impacted in the near term as the company invests heavily in newer initiatives. The company’s fast-growing newer lines of business continue to take a bigger piece of the overall revenue pie as Google’s core search business decelerates. Last quarter, Google’s websites business raked in nearly $18 billion in revenue, accounting for 85% of total sales. Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju expects its other businesses to make up one-third of Alphabet’s total revenue within three years. Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves, whose overweight rating and $1,040 price target make him one of the most bullish analysts covering Alphabet on Wall Street, told clients this week that recent conversations with advertisers reinforced his confidence in Google’s search advertising business. The advertisers eased his concerns about YouTube advertising, while Google’s efforts in the cloud “seem to be showing some signs of progress,” he wrote. Despite a boycott on Google’s YouTube ads last quarter that some analysts feared would cut into its first-quarter sales, MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson said he expects a “negligible impact.” But expect questions about this from analysts on the conference call and additional insight into Google’s plans to provide more advanced and transparent video metrics starting next quarter.

Photo / Chris Ratcliffe After revolutionizing phones, Apple is testing self-driving cars and exploring augmented reality. Recent hires suggest the company is now also looking to the skies. The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet's Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about Apple's private plans. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Google. Fenwick, Trela and Duffy didn't respond to requests for comment. With the recruits, Apple is bringing into its ranks two experts in the demanding, expensive field of satellite design and operation. At the moment, these endeavors typically fall into two fields: satellites for collecting images and those for communications. In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates, wrote in a recent blog. Continued below. Related Content Brian Gaynor: No reason to go back to the bad old days 60-plus, swindled and flat broke Imposing GST on low-value imports doesn't level the playing field A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. "It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation," Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025. A lure for technology companies like Apple, Google and Facebook is to connect billions of people who don't have internet access yet. The broadband services being explored by Boeing and others would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems. "You have a new wave of enthusiastic people who aren't inhibited by the hard knocks of the past," said Roger Rusch, who heads satellite consulting firm TelAstra. Still, TMF's Farrar said there's no guarantee Apple will get involved in the Boeing project. The satellite industry is littered with bankruptcies and other failures. Satellite telephone company Iridium filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, and Teledesic abandoned its "internet from the sky" plan more than a decade ago. It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation. Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Indeed, Apple may have hired the Google executives for something other than satellite work. It's already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. Duffy, Fenwick and Trela's new boss, has mostly consumer product experience from Dropcam. It's internet-connected security camera stored images and video of homes and sent alerts to a smartphone app. Alphabet's Nest acquired the business in 2014. After a tumultuous stint there, Duffy joined Apple to form a new team reporting Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple's augmented reality efforts, the people familiar with the matter said. Fenwick and Trela joined Alphabet's Google in 2014 when the search giant acquired Skybox Imaging, their satellite-imaging startup, for $500 million. However, this year Google sold the renamed business, Terra Bella, to startup Planet Labs, a one-time Skybox rival. Google also planned to invest about $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler, however Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb, and Google ended up investing $1 billion in SpaceX. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back.

Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it.

Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Chrome 58 Rolling Out to Mac, Windows, & Linux, Lacks Touch Bar Support for MacBook Pro By Zara Ali Apr 19, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google has started rolling out Chrome 58 update to Mac, Windows, and Linux. This version of Chrome brings a variety of new features for developers along with the usual security fixes. Many users were expecting Chrome 58 to include support for the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro, but it does not appear in this update. There are fair chances that Google might add the support in the incremental update. The Touch Bar keys on MacBook Pro are like a panel of shortcuts given in a horizontal strip. It includes controls for adding a bookmark, refresh, moving forward and backward, instant access to Omnibox, and much more. Sadly, Chrome 58 does not bring support in this initial update. Related Google Might Bring Its Default Ad-Blocking Feature for Chrome Browser Other than the lack of support for Touch Bar, the Chrome 58 update does not fall short on other features. It brings full support for IndexedDB 2.0, which makes the browser good at handling large data files. Also, there are other methods as well that will make Chrome faster with Chrome 58, such as the new schema management, bulk action methods, and more standardized handling of failures. There also a small change that comes along with Chrome 58 and it enables developers to customize Chrome’s native media control buttons for downloading, full screen, and playback. Advertisement Chrome 58 also brings improvements to iframes. It now handles third-party content like advertising that redirects users to a new page automatically, with Chrome 58 this behaviour has been taken care of, as developers can now put third-party content inside sandboxed iframes. For some advertisements, there is a new iframe sandbox that navigates and lets ads be moved to the top of the page by the user. It also brings changes for Progressive Web Apps on Android, these apps can now go completely full screen and hide the status and navigation bar. With this, users can now get a better and more immersive viewing experience. Regarding security, Chrome 58 update squashes a total 29 bugs. Here are the bugs that were found by external developers, each developer was awarded prize money for the discovery. Google spent $14000 for these bug bounties.

Opinion: Electron Is Flash For The Desktop Why You Can't Always Trust Google's Top Featured Answers Patrick Allan Apr 22, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  explainer fake news google google home google search search videos Share When you type a question into Google Search, you'll often get a complete answer right at the top of the page. These featured answers can be a great time-saver, but they can also be dead wrong. Why would Google be giving you incorrect information front and centre? Well, the video above from the Vox YouTube channel spills the beans. These short bits of information at the top of a Google search page, known as "featured snippets", are considered to be "rich answers", or answers that are given special priority beyond the usual results you'll find below it. Basically, rich answers give you the desired information without you having to click on any links. Or if you have a Google Home, those rich answer snippets are usually what you get when you ask the personal assistant device a question. As The Outline explains, Google determines those snippets using technology similar to its Knowledge Graph database, but also doesn't limit itself to verified sources the way Knowledge Graph does. That means Google's featured answers can be pulled in from almost any top search result, even if it's a third-party website. So how do they get to be at the top? Part of it is popularity, but that isn't all. Google places priority on links that directly answer common questions, links that answer those questions in fewer words than others, and it likes links that offer the information in a list format. It doesn't matter if the information is accurate or not. For example, if you asked Google "why fire trucks were red" in the past, you'd get a quote from Monty Python. Other past examples include Google listing Barack Obama as "King of America", or a snippet saying dinosaurs never existed. And a whole lot of questions get those snippets. In fact, one study found around 31.2 per cent of 1.4 million searches had a snippet sitting pretty at the top. Not all of those rich answers are wrong, of course, but many of them could be and Google's search police are unaware. Why? Google Search uses an automated process that decides whether it should keep a snippet or change it out based on the snippet's performance. So a totally false statement could be a top featured answer until someone points it out. Google is usually pretty quick at fixing these things when someone takes notice, but they can't catch everything before it potentially does some damage. So, as you go about your online searches, don't always believe the first thing you read. WATCH MORE: Tech News & Life Hacks Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

The Mouldy Foods You Can And Can't Eat Thorin Klosowski 22 Apr 2017 12:00 PM When you find a bit of mould on food, it might seem like it's OK to salvage some of it because the mould doesn't cover the whole thing. That seems like the logical step, right? It turns out that's not true for a lot of foods, like bread, because the mould can hide deep in the surface where you can't see it.

The built-in assistant can now learn up to six people’s voice to distinguish users allowing Home to provide customized information for each person. This is the first product of its kind to have the voice recognition feature, and with it comes good and bads. On one hand, you’ll be able to avoid things like the case of the Amazon Echo ordering dollhouses after hearing a news anchor on tv reporting a story about a girl ordering dollhouses. On the other hand, the privacy-focused Maryland-based Shear Law says Google will have more detailed information about you, which could be used in ways that consumers may not realize. Even though the devices are activated when using wake phrases like “Alexa” or “Hey Google”, the devices can be triggered by accident and private comments can be taken out of context. Google noted that the voice feature isn't yet foolproof. “We’re just getting started and we won’t be perfect,” the statement said. “We don’t recommend that users rely upon voice identification as a security feature.” Well, that makes me feel so much better...

Last quarter, Alphabet’s GOOGL, -0.13% GOOG, +0.18%   earnings fell short of expectations largely due to tax charges, including one charge tied to its stock-based compensation plan that shaved roughly 83 cents a share off non-GAAP earnings. While announcing those results, Alphabet execs announced the company will begin to emphasize GAAP earnings as opposed to non-GAAP, which allow companies to use accounting gymnastics to exclude stock- based compensation and one-time charges that may have been incurred during the quarter. Read Also: The tax hit that made Google miss on earnings, and the big change that will keep it from happening again On the company’s earnings call in January, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, a Wall Street veteran who previously led the finance department at Morgan Stanley, said the company was changing its accounting metrics because it no longer wanted to exclude stock-based compensation, or SBC, from its results. Alphabet will still break down stock-based compensation on its cash flow statement for investors who prefer to look at results without it, but the company will present the GAAP figure as its main earnings result. “Although it’s not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world,” Porat said. MarketWatch has been covering the complicated world of GAAP vs. non-GAAP earnings for years. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has promised to start cracking down on made-up numbers this year, though many companies still rely on non-GAAP results. Also See: How investors are duped each earnings season Alphabet’s results for the second quarter will be closely watched for any negative results from a controversy for YouTube, which saw advertisers pull spending after news reports showed ads running on objectionable videos. Any effects may be hard to spot, however, as Google’s results for search and other advertising are combined with YouTube results, which have never been presented separately. YouTube's Viewership Could Soon Overtake TV(1:46) YouTube viewers world-wide are now watching more than 1 billion hours of videos a day, boosted by algorithms personalizing user lineups. The number represents a ten-fold increase from 2012. Photo: Getty Images Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to report GAAP earnings per share of $7.39, compared with $7.50 in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items that occurred during the quarter, the non-GAAP metric Alphabet has focused on in the past, analysts are calling for earnings of $9.41 a share. Estimize, a software platform that pools together estimates from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expects Alphabet to report earnings $8.57 a share. The Estimize number is usually closer to the FactSet non-GAAP number, but this quarter is different because it reflects a wide spectrum of contributors who may be issuing a mix of forecasts based on Google’s previous and newer financial reporting standards. Estimize Chief Executive Leigh Drogen told MarketWatch that the platform’s algorithms are offsetting that by overweighting the newer estimates, but the old estimates are still skewing it. Alphabet missed both the FactSet and Estimize consensus earnings estimates last quarter, but surpassed them in the two prior quarters. Revenue: Alphabet is expected to report revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, of $19.8 billion, compared with $16.5 billion in the year-earlier period, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Estimize contributors predict Alphabet sales of $19.7 billion. Alphabet topped both estimates in each of the past three quarters, and analysts continue to be optimistic about advertising trends despite the YouTube controversy. The Google division of Alphabet is dominated by advertising revenues, though the development of its “other revenues,” which include hardware sales like the Pixel smartphone and Google Play Store revenue, will be interesting to watch after 62% growth last quarter. Alphabet also breaks out “other bets,” a segment that includes its experimental lines of businesses. Read also: Android projected to top Apple in app revenue for first time this year Stock reaction: Shares of Alphabet have performed in-line with the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  since the company’s last earnings report, as both have increased about 3.5% in the past three months. Alphabet’s shares have gained about 10% in the past year, while the S&P is up 12%. Analysts have been mixed on where they think the stock is headed in the next year. While the vast majority of analysts recommend buying the shares, Alphabet was downgraded to market perform at BMO Capital Markets earlier this month due to fears that Google was facing fiercer competition from Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.39%  The BMO analysts cut their price target on the stock to $880 from $1,005. Other analysts, however, believe Alphabet’s best is still to come. Last week, Credit Suisse reiterated a $1,100 target and outperform rating on the stock and said investors may be underestimating the potential benefits of its newer business lines, such as YouTube TV, Google Play and the cloud. Read: Alphabet’s stock may finally outperform Facebook and Amazon The average analyst rating is the equivalent to buy, according to a FactSet survey of more than 30 analystsm who have an average price target of $982.26. Shares closed at $858.95 Friday. What to watch for: Analysts have been forecasting an in-line quarter for Google, though some have warned that profit growth may be impacted in the near term as the company invests heavily in newer initiatives. The company’s fast-growing newer lines of business continue to take a bigger piece of the overall revenue pie as Google’s core search business decelerates. Last quarter, Google’s websites business raked in nearly $18 billion in revenue, accounting for 85% of total sales. Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju expects its other businesses to make up one-third of Alphabet’s total revenue within three years. Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves, whose overweight rating and $1,040 price target make him one of the most bullish analysts covering Alphabet on Wall Street, told clients this week that recent conversations with advertisers reinforced his confidence in Google’s search advertising business. The advertisers eased his concerns about YouTube advertising, while Google’s efforts in the cloud “seem to be showing some signs of progress,” he wrote. Despite a boycott on Google’s YouTube ads last quarter that some analysts feared would cut into its first-quarter sales, MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson said he expects a “negligible impact.” But expect questions about this from analysts on the conference call and additional insight into Google’s plans to provide more advanced and transparent video metrics starting next quarter.

Last quarter, Alphabet’s GOOGL, -0.13% GOOG, +0.18%   earnings fell short of expectations largely due to tax charges, including one charge tied to its stock-based compensation plan that shaved roughly 83 cents a share off non-GAAP earnings. While announcing those results, Alphabet execs announced the company will begin to emphasize GAAP earnings as opposed to non-GAAP, which allow companies to use accounting gymnastics to exclude stock- based compensation and one-time charges that may have been incurred during the quarter. Read Also: The tax hit that made Google miss on earnings, and the big change that will keep it from happening again On the company’s earnings call in January, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, a Wall Street veteran who previously led the finance department at Morgan Stanley, said the company was changing its accounting metrics because it no longer wanted to exclude stock-based compensation, or SBC, from its results. Alphabet will still break down stock-based compensation on its cash flow statement for investors who prefer to look at results without it, but the company will present the GAAP figure as its main earnings result. “Although it’s not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world,” Porat said. MarketWatch has been covering the complicated world of GAAP vs. non-GAAP earnings for years. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has promised to start cracking down on made-up numbers this year, though many companies still rely on non-GAAP results. Also See: How investors are duped each earnings season Alphabet’s results for the second quarter will be closely watched for any negative results from a controversy for YouTube, which saw advertisers pull spending after news reports showed ads running on objectionable videos. Any effects may be hard to spot, however, as Google’s results for search and other advertising are combined with YouTube results, which have never been presented separately. YouTube's Viewership Could Soon Overtake TV(1:46) YouTube viewers world-wide are now watching more than 1 billion hours of videos a day, boosted by algorithms personalizing user lineups. The number represents a ten-fold increase from 2012. Photo: Getty Images Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to report GAAP earnings per share of $7.39, compared with $7.50 in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items that occurred during the quarter, the non-GAAP metric Alphabet has focused on in the past, analysts are calling for earnings of $9.41 a share. Estimize, a software platform that pools together estimates from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expects Alphabet to report earnings $8.57 a share. The Estimize number is usually closer to the FactSet non-GAAP number, but this quarter is different because it reflects a wide spectrum of contributors who may be issuing a mix of forecasts based on Google’s previous and newer financial reporting standards. Estimize Chief Executive Leigh Drogen told MarketWatch that the platform’s algorithms are offsetting that by overweighting the newer estimates, but the old estimates are still skewing it. Alphabet missed both the FactSet and Estimize consensus earnings estimates last quarter, but surpassed them in the two prior quarters. Revenue: Alphabet is expected to report revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, of $19.8 billion, compared with $16.5 billion in the year-earlier period, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Estimize contributors predict Alphabet sales of $19.7 billion. Alphabet topped both estimates in each of the past three quarters, and analysts continue to be optimistic about advertising trends despite the YouTube controversy. The Google division of Alphabet is dominated by advertising revenues, though the development of its “other revenues,” which include hardware sales like the Pixel smartphone and Google Play Store revenue, will be interesting to watch after 62% growth last quarter. Alphabet also breaks out “other bets,” a segment that includes its experimental lines of businesses. Read also: Android projected to top Apple in app revenue for first time this year Stock reaction: Shares of Alphabet have performed in-line with the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  since the company’s last earnings report, as both have increased about 3.5% in the past three months. Alphabet’s shares have gained about 10% in the past year, while the S&P is up 12%. Analysts have been mixed on where they think the stock is headed in the next year.

In turn, Samsung needs to contain its software ambitions wherever they may rival with Android and directly related services. That includes effectively abandoning Tizen’s once mighty growth and expansion plans, as well as agreeing to the pre-installation of Google Assistant on Galaxy S8 and S8+ phones alongside Bixby. Both the chaebol and Mountain View-based search giant made a compromise there, although Samsung was quick to pull the plug on the AI button’s remapping “feature.” Meanwhile, you can probably forget all about Samsung Music, the Korean OEM’s Google Play Music contender that already found no room on last year’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Starting today with the official “global” rollout of the GS8, not only is Play Music the “default music player and music service on new Samsung phones and tablets” worldwide, as “special features” are also provided “just for Samsung customers.” We’re talking a free three-month trial of Google Play Music, plus double its standard storage capacity, i.e. the complimentary ability to upload and stream up to 100,000 songs instead of “only” 50K. Those aren’t exactly earth-shattering promos, but combined with bundled access to YouTube Red and native Bixby integration coming “later this spring”, they make the Galaxy S8 and Play Music a hard to resist duo for audiophiles and audio streaming enthusiasts around the world.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

K77bkny +10000000000000000000000 I feel your pain bro.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2d8b2327848f2f807a654f3361b7a15a91f445b4025bedef783b3421ccc48e0f.gif dcdttu I think this is the worst excuse for Google's messaging mess of all. Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung.  Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

Adblocker tools are increasingly popular with internet users tired of interruptions from annoying pop-up and video promotions. Now Google is preparing to launch its own version built-in to the company’s popular web browser Chrome. Google is to introduce an adblocker that will stop its rivals yet still allow the online giant’s own adverts to keep generating it £47 billion a year, it has been reported Yet the tool – which could be switched on by default – will reportedly keep Google’s own online adverts that generated the American firm more than £47 billion last year. Google has declined to comment after sources told the Wall Street Journal the feature could be announced with weeks. One quarter of British internet users are thought to already use adblockers. And Google also pays these third-party ad-blockers large sums to approve promotional material from its own network, it was reported. Daniel Gilbert, chief executive of marketing agency Brainlabs, told The Times: ‘This is a clear move by Google to wipe out the ad-blockers because they pose a threat to Google.

Share this article Share ‘If Google can tidy up the ad ecosystem in Chrome, then they are hoping that users won’t feel the need to install an additional blocker, let alone pay for a service.’ The Coalition for Better Ads recently released a list of online advert standards which deemed pop-ups and video ads with sounds as ‘beneath a threshold of consumer acceptability’. Google could also choose to block all adverts on a site even if one or two breach the standards, the Wall Street Journal reported. But the new feature could land the giant in trouble with competition watchdogs. The EU’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is already investigating Google, reportedly said she would follow the new feature closely. Adblocker tools are increasingly popular with internet users tired of interruptions from annoying pop-up and video promotions Paul Armstrong, of consultancy company Here/Forth, told The Times said: ‘While the move could lead to watchdog scrutiny, Google has a dominant position to protect as advertising remains its most significant revenue stream.’ A Google spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on rumour or speculation. ‘We’ve been working closely with the Coalition for Better Ads and industry trades to explore a multitude of ways Google and other members of the Coalition could support the Better Ads Standards.’ A Daily Mail investigation this month revealed Google was making money from content promoting self harm and eating disorders. Adverts for brands including Amazon and Microsoft were found to be running alongside YouTube videos of people cutting themselves with razor blades, and talking about self-mutilation. Google places adverts using automated technology rather than human judgment and hands the people who post the content up to £6.15 for every 1,000 views. The Government and the BBC were among those to pull advertising from Google’s YouTube platform last month after it emerged their adverts were being run alongside videos posted by extremist groups.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos GRAPHIC: Horrifying moment pit bull attacks toddler in street Former Patriot Aaron Hernandez found hanging in his prison cell Terrifying footage shows moments after Paris shooting Attempted rapist runs from police moments before being arrested Crewman jumps from cargo ship to save whale tangled in net Mom sobs after AA flight attendant 'violently took her stroller' Hilarious footage of a screaming man experiencing labour pains Film makers expose 'major new developments' in McCann case Angry woman gets escorted off plane by police Robert Irwin and Jimmy play with baby bears on The Tonight Show Man punches woman as she tries to intervene in street fight Farmer gives very 'country' account of car crash and bee attack EXCLUSIVE: Aaron Hernandez left behind a handwritten...

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 26 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares101 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! TheScientists I'm kind of amazed someone hasn't already done this. It's the most basic of necessary functionality in an 'assistant'. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ So after posting this yesterday I looked into it, and sadly there's still no official API for creating reminders, and surprisingly no one has made an unofficial one either. So then I extracted the Inbox APK and decompiled it, I'm working my way through the code to see if I can't start pinning something down, but I'm betting they'll release actual support before I manage to do that. TheScientists Kudos to you, sir. I would have thought there would be something of note in the Google app apk? Or maybe some 1/2-assed way to do it via IFTTT. And, no, I wouldn't take that bet. Google is in no rush to do anything. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The problem is that the decompiled source doesn't exactly come across in a way that makes perfect sense. If a Java class isn't named in the manifest, it ends up getting somewhat obfuscated by proguard, so instead of seeing something like ReminderBuilder I end up with something named C12345, and even the classes are built in such a way that an object ends up being built up through multiple classes instead of just in a singular method, so it's complicated. I did look into IFTTT as well yesterday hoping for a quick solution but was disappointed. We'll see how far I get before either finding some options or just giving up out of frustration. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. dcdttu Once you can distinguish between users isn't all you need for reading/writing appointments....you've got to actually code that process, too. That's likely what they're doing now. So far in my testing at my house, it's quite good at knowing the different voices in our household. I wouldn't see their lack of confidence being a problem, honestly, because before the multi-user features were enabled, you could get personal information off Google Home for one user. Adding more than one user, even if it's giving the info to the wrong person, doesn't seem to be any worse. pfmiller My assumption was that they already have the code for writing data to their services since it's already done in every other application. That part of the problem isn't exactly novel. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Artem Russakovskii (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Gaurav Arora Please keep the table back where it was kyds3k ┬──┬﻿ ノ( ゜-゜ノ) senor_heisenberg Goddamn Lars Jeppesen Trololol Aaron Berlin I'm sure that's coming. I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! Jimjames Esson Well said,, Google to me ,if i have a Rheumotolgy appointment i simply use Google Calendar..!! Easy peasy lemon sqeasy..lol Blake What's an SRE? Petr Faitl I highly suspect that the answer is a highly political. No doubt it's product managers who can't agree with privacy gurus to prevent a few pranksters (i.e. one's kids) adding events to your calendar. abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Lars Jeppesen Who cares mustbepbs I do, because when I want to add a few minutes to a kitchen timer, I have to cancel the current one and create a new one with the new time. Kitchen timers from fuckin Dollar General have this "feature". abc He does. As he just said. Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. Ryan Music, pairing it with Smartthings to be a home controller, etc. I USED to use it for my shopping list, which was great. But they broke that function just recently. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. Lars Jeppesen I love mine - I'm sorry you can't figure out why it could be useful. Ryan I got mine on discount, so that helped. But I use it as a voice control for my smart-home features and to play music. JG What about Hangouts? I'm assuming since you said it can't yet write to the account, could it at least read my incoming Hangouts to me? davidofmidnight never forget... A re-review of Google Home, 7 months in. pic.twitter.com/N5bHZg2iTk— Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) March 20, 2017 trickytree1984 Support for exchange calendars is just as important. Most of the world don't use one personal Google calendar for their work and home life Navarr Barnier I'm assuming that MU was a blocker ticket, and they just pushed it out as quickly as they could - so reminders and appointments would be a WIP now that the blocker is out of the way. Surely.. right? right? Jonathan Sorry, but I just don't care about not having this feature, and I don't think many average users do either. But it wouldn't be a post about the Home if AP didn't gripe about it! Ryan Id use it daily, just like how I used the shopping list daily. Its a pretty basic feature that most people use (which is apparently by the unlimited competing choices for calendar and todo apps). Jonathan I agree that it's a basic feature that seems simple enough to execute and should have been implemented from the start​. I just don't think that many people are clamoring for it in their Bluetooth speaker outside of the AP sphere. And it's just getting silly and petty that the AP writers mention it in 95% of the articles they write​ about it. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The Home isn't just some Bluetooth speaker. It's SUPPOSED to be an assistive device that currently doesn't do the most basic tasks. I set reminders constantly across my phone, my watch, and in my car. It drives me crazy that I still can't do this on what is marketed as being the flagship device for Google Assistant. Ryan Or place items in Keep, like it used to be able to do. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I would love to be able to add items to ANY list in Keep. When my wife and I organize parties we use shared lists in Keep and it would be great to just add things as we talk about them. Stephen Cunningham I cant' get over Google taking the shopping list out of Keep. They are walking backwards not forward. I was hoping you would be able to add to any Keep list or add a note to Keep. Mike Jones i would like to add calendar appointments and i would like to add another minute to a timer too but that doesn't kill Home for me. i have a lot of home automation and i get a ton of use out of that. i just had a scare the other night where i thought i heard something in my house right as i was getting into bed. "google turn on the lights" and my house lit up like daytime.... it made it simple to check out the house.

Google launches Tabel, an experimental WebVR film Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/20 7:53am PDTApr 20, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares76 News Videos Google is starting to really push WebVR, the in-browser virtual reality platform that Chrome recently started supporting. The company recently showed off 12 new WebVR experiments to showcase various different applications for the tech. Now, Google is launching something even more impressive, the experimental VR film Tabel. Announced on Google blog The Keyword, Tabel is a short film telling multiple stories. Set against the backdrop of a busy restaurant, the different storylines are told by 6 different conversations amongst the clientele. As you look around the room, you're fed only the audio pertaining to the conversation that is currently in focus. So you're encouraged to move around and listen in on the unfolding events around you, knowing that while you're listening to one discussion you're neglecting another. It's a clever concept that is sure to inspire repeat viewing. The video below gives you an idea of how it works: While you'll obviously only get the full, immersive experience using Daydream or Google Cardboard, you can also watch the film directly in your browser. This makes experiments like these far more accessible, and is certainly a good way to get people more excited about VR. Tabel is filmed using the insane Jump camera developed in conjunction with GoPro. Hopefully we'll see more interesting WebVR projects using similar techniques down the line.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Qualcomm's Sales Decline for Baseband Modems for the iPhone 8 will hurt their Bottom Line | Main April 21, 2017 Apple may be Backing Boeing's Low-Earth Satellite Constellation Project that would Compete with Google, SpaceX & Others In a new report this afternoon we learn that at the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insider Tim Farrar said Boeing's low-earth satellite project was being funded by Apple. Tim Farrar is a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates. The reason that this speculation may have some meat on its bones is because Apple has recruited a pair of Google satellite executives for a new hardwared team. Google is backing the OneWeb project. Whether it's another dream chasing team like Apple's Project Titan for electric cars is unknown at this time, but Apple has to dream big if they want to tap into possible emerging markets. Bloomberg's authors try to stitch together a plausible scenario and you could read their full story here.   Boeing's application for a license from the Federal Communications Commission to launch and operate a network of 1,396 satellites was actually reported on last June. Boeing want's to be able to compete with SpaceX (Elon Musk) and OneWeb (backed by Google) in a race to build constellations for broadband Internet access. The catch is that Boeing stated that the project would launch in six years after obtaining approval from the Commission. So this isn't a project 'just around the corner' and why speculating too far ahead is close to useless.   In total, Boeing says that they would eventually have 2,956 satellites designed to provide Internet and communications services for commercial and governent users around the globe.   According to the LA Times report, Boeing was still working out whether it will actually provide the service or just make the satellites and get them into orbit, and where the satellites will be built.   Marco Caceres, senior space analyst for the Teal Group, said at the time that the new plans for satellite constellations are driven by the potential of increased access to and new uses of the Internet. 'Everybody's trying to propose these massive constellations and be the first one to get it up there and take advantage of creating a whole new market. No one wants to be left behind."   So we can understand that Apple has to get their head around how they can craft hardware and services to take advantage of such a new satellite based Internet service.   While this kind of venture has been dreamed up before and failed, this next generation of satelites could make it economically feasible. A secondary L.A. Times report posted in December 2016 noted that "Launching one of these smaller satellites can cost a fraction of the price for a larger, school-bus-sized satellite. These new satellites will largely be mass-produced.     If this latest wave of satellite networks gets off the ground, it could pose a challenge to a $224.6-billion industry currently dominated by telecom and cable companies with their miles of fiber optic and copper wires.   Taylor Palmer, industry analyst at market research firm IBISWorld stated in the 2016 report that satellilte networks are "going to shake up how these operators are controlling different regions, and it's going to allow the consumer a little more of an option."   If Apple still has any dreams of a true TV challenging service that could bypass the cable networks, satellite networks would be the way to go.   Once Boeing entered the market, their possible future competitors attempted to point to the flaws of their proposed system. FierceWireless posted a report on this in November 2016 titled "Boeing responds to 'errors' and 'flawed assumptions' about its proposed satellite system in 37/39 GHz band."   Who were some of these Boeing competitors? Interestingly enough, they're also Apple competitors, Samsung and Nokia. So would it be in Apple's interest to fund Boeing's project and prepare a backup business plan for the next-wave of the internet? Yes of course.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Things have changed since then because if anything, Samsung and Google seem to be a lot closer than ever. It has been confirmed that Samsung will now be using Google Play Music as the default music app on Samsung devices. This actually began last year with the Galaxy S7, but this year is slightly different as it seems that Google will be making some enhancements to its Play Music service that will be exclusive to Samsung customers. This includes the ability to upload as many as 100,000 songs to the cloud (normal listeners can only upload 50,000) so that they can be streamed anywhere. Galaxy S8 owners will also be given a free 3-month trial to the paid tier of Play Music, and will also eventually add support for Bixby Voice whenever that feature is ready for primetime. Google has also promised to deliver other special features for Play Music just for Samsung customers in the future. We’re pretty sure some Play Music subscribers might be miffed at this fragmentation of features in the service, but unfortunately that’s just the way things are, so if you don’t want to miss out then we guess you’ll just have to grab yourself a Samsung smartphone.

Even one of Google's support specialists discovered he was experiencing the issue, but apart from reaching out to those affected for bug reports no information has been publicly provided. To be clear, for those with the problem their personal data in one or more categories may not be being backed up as they would expect. Not to be alarmist, but with this backup error occurring silently, it might be prudent for Pixel users to check that their devices are, in fact, performing their backups as expected and intended. To check for yourself, navigate to Settings, Backup and Reset, Backup and see if any of the items listed under Content are "Waiting to backup." If you are among those suffering the problem you might want to exercise some caution and consider another backup method for whatever might be failing for you. Also, feel free to add your voices (and log-files) down at Google's product forums. They're currently reaching out to those affected there for additional information, and with more data the issue can probably be fixed that much more quickly.

Gustavo Me too, also only seeing it in Call History on my Pixel teh Jax At least the important ones are working fine! Andrew same here Ryne Hager That's not a huge deal, then. Not the worst thing to lose if your phone eats it. Photos or SMS could be a bigger problem, though. teh Jax Right. If somebody is experiencing this bug with other pieces of data, this is a big deal! If this is all it is, hardly anybody is going to care. And those that do care probably should be using multiple forms of backup anyway. Sachin Bahal Same here Suicide_Note Same. That's the only one that had any issue on my device. steb0ne Same here... So most people in this comment section who actually have Pixel devices seem to be having the same issue with the call history not backing up and a bunch of trolling by other people talking about how it's plagued with bugs, lol! Got it! I wonder how long it's been acting up... Everything else shows backed up this morning. If this is a daily backup and it didn't backup one day is this really that big of a deal? The screenshot posted shows December... I'm curious to know is this a Google feature or Pixel feature? Can someone else with a phone running Nougat confirm if theirs is backing up? teh Jax Definitely a lot of trolling and ignorance going on in these comments. That's pretty typical by people commenting about a premium device that they either can't buy or chose not to buy - it helps them justify their situation. Which is fine by me. It's rare that comments are actually insightful. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ teddyfrozevelt Mine hasn't backed up since I factory reset it in december. Everything else has backed up. Impulse_Vigil It's an Android feature, has been forever, but O and the Pixel are the first places where it's status has been exposed and broken down by category. So it may or may not be working elsewhere, you wouldn't really know. Now freak out! Heh... steb0ne That's what I thought... So it's possibly happening on other non Pixel devices. The article made it seem Pixel specific CJ Me too. Maxr1998 Same for me, Nexus 6P, O Preview. Also had that issue for SMS & apps after I clean-flashed the update, but I could at least fix the latter by manually running "bmgr backupnow --all" in a su shell. SMS somehow resolved itself it seems. Impulse_Vigil Same, everything else is backed up, didn't even know call history could be backed up. 4Ui812 Better call Saul. Bat Man 1 day = 1 problem? 4Ui812 Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea.... Google's quality control is hard at work. Middlefinger Yeah, but at least it gets 'Timely updates' /s Phalkon30 Just bought my 6p 2 weeks ago, not a single thing moved to it from my previous device. It's like I never had a Google history, even though I have app backups on my Google Drive. I even tried to to set up from another device, it gave an unknown error and moved nothing I'm going to have to root to fix it, awful backup solution sproc I think it only works with the same phone honestly, cause otherwise I bet no one uses it sadly. Tiuri Elvander Sent in my 6p for an RMA, it was fully backed up. Tried to restore the backup on my replacement 6p but it only offered my One plus One (which I used while I was waiting for my replacement). The whole thing lasted less than a week, yet my original backup was not available as an option to restore. Very annoying!! Jordan VanCampen Same here. My work phone which is a Moto z play stopped working. I got a replacement and thought that I'd be able restore it from the previous one, but nope. The setup process only gave me the option to restore from my Vizio tablet that came with my TV that I recently bought. My pixel that is my personal phone wasn't an option. So I decided that I would use the NFC option. So I I did that with my pixel and it didn't restore anything at all. The backup situation on Android is still pretty much a dumpster fire. Ryne Hager I've had the restore from previous device thing bug out as well, I usually just set everything up as a new device now. blindexecutioner $800 device running never-ending beta software. Jingwei Zhang It does backup a lot of settings for many apps. As for games, if the game requires logging in, it backs up the log in information if you had it set as memorized. It also memorizes the layout of the apps. The backup is definitely not the best, but it's automatic and much more comprehensive than the native backup other manufacturers provide, including ios. Roy Hm, no. I used an iphone and ipod touch ages ago and they actually have a backup solution that works. When you restore, it's like you never left - even between devices. Even Blackberry had a better backup system than Android ever has - the only decent backup solution Android has is Titanium backup (which is, to be fair, excellent), and that requires root so most people are SOL. I've never even had my wifi settings restored properly, even though that's supposedly backed up. Jingwei Zhang Hm, no. We have six iPhones in the family and none of them backup like you said here (like you never left). However, my Nexus to Pixel transfer was like that. All apps, photos, sms and etc were restored to the same position and most pertinent settings were restored. IIRC, the phone even restored my company's WIFI setting with the correct credential. I don't know which android phone you have, but Google's backup does some pretty amazing things for requiring absolutely no maintenance on the user's side. EDIT: I just remembered. My sister and mom actually use Google Photo on their iPhone 6S/7 because it's free and easy as opposed to the tiny iCloud storage. JohnyNoLegs Its free when it compresses your photos. Also iPhone does whole phone backup, android does not. Also if you lose your pixel right now, you are screwed, as you can't do a transfer. Jingwei Zhang IIRC Pixel has full photo backup without any compression. I believe I specifically said that it does some amazing things with absolutely no user side maintenance. You can always do a manual full backup with titanium or in recovery. Root and unlocked bootloader are needed, but that's just takes a few minutes with Nexus and Pixel. How is that? Everything is automatically backed up including video, pic and sms, call history and etc on a daily basis. I would wager that you can retrieve more current information from a lost Pixel/Nexus than from a lost iPhone if they were both lost and went completely off the grid. JohnyNoLegs Wager away, then send me the money. iPhone does a bit for bit backup, it backs up the current state of the whole iPhone. Google does not do this. Google selectively backs up items like call history, sms etc. Pixel is the only Android phone that offers uncompressed backup for free, not really an option for everyone mate. Titanium backup is for ROOT LOLOLOLOL. Recovery is for unlocked devices LOLOLOLOLOL iPhone does complete backup with any hacking required, talk about no user side maintenance! BTW, my Pixel stopped backup up photos, it's a bug. Doesn't sound like no user maintenance required haha Jingwei Zhang hmm comparing full backup that can take upwards of an hour to one that runs in the background huh? You definitely understand what no user maintenance is and are certainly brilliant. Comparing apple to orange as long as it suits your narrative. Are we talking about any other android phone? I don't think so. Unlocking bootloader and granting root access are considered hacking now? Bugs and failures happen, just like how two of our iPhone 6 bricked just out of warranty. Also, my Pixel is not experiencing this bug, so it's not a problem for me (yet). JohnyNoLegs Think logically for a second mate. You are talking a out no user maintenance. IPhone does full backups while you sleep. Android does not. To root your phone and unlock the bootloader requires user maintenance. Impulse_Vigil I do think iOS backup functionality is more comprehensive, it doesn't leave things up to individual devs either... OTOH it does gobble up a pretty decent amount of storage on accounts where people often end up having to pay extra for... Nothing is perfect. JohnyNoLegs It's true, but for the person who just wants their stuff backed up, IOS has it covered much better than android. Even the simplicity of setting up iCloud to do everything is great. In Android it is a bit all over the shop in deep settings and different apps. I'm fine with Androids implementation, but then again I don't care about doing factory resets etc which is kinda the nature of android. iPhone users perhaps are less used to having to restore their data all the time. Syukri Lajin Google doesn't backup call history and sms. that's the only shitty part i have to complain about. JohnyNoLegs It does do SMS 100% as i just restored from a reset. Ryne Hager I think it backs up some appdata, like Netflix login information carrying over to new devices, that sort of thing. JohnyNoLegs After an RMA and a few factory resets, I can tell you it hasn't in my case. Impulse_Vigil It can do that, but apps need to be written for it, backup has always been a joke on Android but it's largely because devs ignore the existing tools tbh. Killa I'm not seeing any option on my Nexus 6 in the Backup & Reset area that shows the breakout of the different backup content like it does in the image above. There's just the On/Off switch and language that says backups are in Google Drive...etc. Is this only a Pixel thing or higher version of Android? Phalkon30 Must be a pixel thing, I don't see it on my 6P either, and I'm on 7.1.2 Cyan Thayn It's also an O thing apparently, have the exact menu shown in the screenshots on my 6P on the O preview (and have the same bugs as well!). Ryne Hager It's a pixel thing, no need to worry. Impulse_Vigil I'm not even sure what the point is, I guess extra info and transparency (which is good), because none of those options really do anything but tell you what's being backed up. There's nothing to toggle besides the main backup option and the option to backup to Drive. Shoot, other phones could be suffering the same issues but because the backup status isn't displayed nobody would know! On my Pixel everything but call history is up to date, and I couldn't care less about that. Killa Can you head into your Google Drive and look at the Backups for your Pixel? Is each content type separated out...like text, call history, etc.? Ishimaru Another day, another Pixel issue. Ramon Google is fucking up a lot lately. What's taking so long to fire some people? Just not just lately Conrad Okay, so what happened to the review of the Synology 416play? I'd really like to read it! lomsha Some premium device lol. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Once again, I told you so. You should really run a daily series called "Google Screwup Of The Day". Ryne Hager Your name is amazing. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Not many people get it. ;) J.J. Pixel and problem are two words heard often lately! Leif Sikorski Same with previous Nexus and some other Google Hardware devices. It's one reason why I'm glad that other OEMs update slower these days. Google keeps giving me the impression that they still see their devices as geeky developer devices where the user does the final testing. If they want to be more serious with their hardware efforts and compete with the big brands they need to invest much more money into testing and customer support. Ryne Hager Eh, bugs happen with any tech, and the volume of problems has gotten a lot smaller than things used to be back in the day. Progress has its pitfalls, is all. Nick I'm with you here. I get that people expect nothing but excellence from a device that they paid a pretty penny for, but stuff happens sometimes and so far it hasn't been anything that warrants the level of indignation I am seeing here in the comment section. I'm sure Google will fix the issue as soon as they possibly can. JohnyNoLegs And by progress, you mean they haven't really done anything different right? Still the same updates with bugs, still take ages to fix anything. I am still having the worst bluetooth experience of any phone I have owned, and that's after an RMA already! Anon Now we know why the pixel includes 24/7 support. Lisarbeams Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Chang Hi, I posted this, but it got kicked to bottom of thread. So, here it is again. Hope it is some help. Gen. Chang • 43 minutes ago Hi all, I wonder if this problem has occurred after any major updates? After I updated to Nougat, I had several issues, but after learning that resetting all app preferences from the app manager page, everything is working as it should. Better, in fact, than even my update to Marshmallow. By far, better Battery savings overnight now too. I wonder if a similar reset might help solve the back up issue for you. It erases all previous settings, but not data. And rebuilds those from scratch. Try turning off back ups, and turn off restore too. As that erases the previous version, then turn off, back on, to reboot. Then go back and turn on back up and restore, creating all NEW back ups. I would reset both app preferences, and erase and rebuild backed up data. This is the easiest thing to do, and not as damaging as a factory reset. Xchris Big deal. Let's see what the bug list for the S8 looks like six months down the line! Phil We're already on a pink screen and what's it been? 2 weeks? I've not heard any reports of exploding Pixels so far at least. Most of the people trolling these articles are Sammy Knights who should know better. I'm looking forward to seeing what problems the S8 has over the next 6 months. By the way, is Bixby's working yet? Mike Bastable The Pixel handsets seen to be agreeing poorly... Lot of bugs recently... Sachin Bahal no device will ever be perfect, there will always be some issue(s) during a device's life cycle, and it just so happens that the Pixel's issues/bugs are happening 6 months into the phone's life cycle Ryne Hager Yeah, I expect they'll probably get things fixed. Bugs happen. Sachin Bahal The Pixel is just crawling with bugs ;) Hussain Ahmadi And some go on to call this crap as best Android phone? A big joke and Google has made a really big joke of itself by releasing this iAndroid phone!! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites, despite all the problems, the halos in the pictures, etc. Even though I NEVER thought it deserved that status, I can understand that most of its problems surfaced after web magazines rated it. But it's clear now that the phone sucks and its software sucks. If publishing had any integrity, they'd issue a correction, revoke that title and make some other phone the best phone of 2016. Impulse_Vigil Or most of the problems aren't really as wide spread as some seem to believe, I've had pretty much no issues with mine. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, that's one of you so far. abc "The Pixel is STILL listed as the Best Android Phone on most sites" That's just sad for Android then. Marty I had a Google backup issue on my OP3T. I factory wiped it after an update and the restore function usually seen during set up didn't appear. YaKillaCJ Something about that picture just bugs me... Impulse_Vigil I see what you did there! Have a ^ Arcest Not new adb restore failed to re-install apk https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37130390 Sir_Brizz Compromise free device. Actually getting tired of making this joke, which says something. Impulse_Vigil Compromise and bug free since Nov here. /shrug New_Guy Geez, they Pixel has so many issues, it's crazy... Phil This problem is only being reported by people enrolled on the beta testing of Android O ffs. Of course there are going to be bugs with am OS still in the testing stage. That's the whole point isn't it? Give people an early look in order that they can identify bugs and instabilities? The problem is not the phone, it a Dev version of an OS. Kevin Sword Loving your hero images Ryne! Mr.Bean ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We're gonna need a can of Raid to squash these bugs. Muzaffar Don't mind the bugs, as long as it get stock android and latest update. ashjas Are these options only pixel specific..? I mean I don't see such backup options on my Nexus 4 with nougut custom rom? Impulse_Vigil Call history is waiting to be backed up here weird, everything else is current. I didn't even know my phone backed up call history tbh... Seems I've gotten ultra lucky with Pixel bugs, outside a handful of sporadic instances of Bluetooth turning off thru the start of the year I've avoided just about everything else. Got mine in November FWIW, tap on wood. Bala Same here since day one for SMS and call history ,it's funny when they say they are looking into. A feature that's supposed to work with final release is not working for a while and still they are looking Jan Machovec Is this something Pixel specific? Because I don't see any option to backup SMS, Call log and others on my SGS7. Hexlattice On slower internet speeds, Photos has a really hard time trying to backup larger files... Normally, getting on a faster network will fix the problem, but if the files are old enough, it's like Photos gives up on trying and I end up having some videos never backup :( abc Pixel problems? https://i.imgflip.com/h8wog.jpg?a414600 Gen.

Praneeth Kancherla They have been looking into it from past few months. Backups on my Pixel XL never worked. I've contacted support through chat option on the phone and all information I got at the end is Google is aware of this issue,actively working on fixing it and fix will be available soon. It looks meaning of soon is certainly different​ in Google's dictionary. Lately my phone has developed so much lag even while doing simple tasks like using keyboard in any app, browsing internet and settings. Google support is okay to replace my device after verifying warranty but cannot ship replacement first even if I'm okay with hold on my credit card for full amount and covering shipping charges. They say replacement may take anytime from 7-10 business days and I need to buy another phone. The reason they quote is I'm not the original buyer. But they were able to verify and confirm that it's​ still under warranty. They are okay with honoring the warranty but not willing to ship replacement first even if I'm okay with covering charges that may incur in doing that. All these issues for $750 smartphone and they taking months to resolve issues without any possible workaround is just terrible in my opinion. I'll still use Pixel and Android as I like them compared to Apple and its ecosystem but I feel Google is certainly not doing enough to retain consumers like me.

What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

[Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares90 Deals News Pixel It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016.

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response?

To further improve the Android Wear developer experience, Google is introducing a new tool that emulates the rotating digital crown found on some smartwatches… UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases Although digital crown functionality is supported by Android Wear out of the box, third-party applications already on the Play Store have to be updated to benefit from the new hardware. This new emulator helps them do just that. The latest Canary build of Android Studio is the first to include the new Android Wear emulator. After updating, developers can implement the code required for digital crown support and test that it works properly without needing to first transfer the application to physical hardware. Currently, there are only two smartwatches on the market that actually have a digital crown, the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style. Google obviously sees the benefit of having a rotating button to help users navigate through Android Wear, so hopefully, we will see more devices in the future feature this new hardware functionality. If you’re a developer or if you would just like to know more about the new emulator, you can head on over to the Android Studio support page for more details. Check out the video below to see how the emulator works. 🌟New! #AndroidWear Emulator now lets you try out rotating side button!

In March, LGBT YouTube creators criticised Google for hiding some of their videos in "Restricted Mode", which filters potentially "mature" content. After initially downplaying the extent of the problem, Google issued a non-apology, then a slightly more apologetic non-apology, and finally posted a fuller actual apology on its blog. In that post, Google acknowledged "this feature isn't working the way it should" and promised it was "going to fix" the issue. A still from a video previously filtered by Restricted Mode. YouTube. Today, Google posted an update on changes it has made to restricted mode. The post doesn't provide many specifics about how it has altered its filtering system, but claims those changes have added more than 12 million videos, "including hundreds of thousands featuring LGBTQ+ content". Twelve million is a lot of videos — though given that 400 hours of YouTube material are uploaded every minute, it's a small fraction of the total number of videos. Still, it implies that something was pretty significantly wrong with the restricted mode algorithm. The post also goes into more detail about what specifically is restricted: Content about drugs and alcohol (including drinking in the video), graphic descriptions of violence, "mature subjects" such as terrorism and war, swearing, and sex. The post says sex is "one of the more difficult topics to train our systems on" and that "overly detailed conversations about sex or sexual activity will likely be removed". This goes at least a little way towards answering the criticisms creators had levelled back in March, when they accused Google of deeming all LGBT-themed discussion as sexually explicit, even when it was completely innocent — like Seaine's video discussing her decision to come out as trans. Previously, Google had told Gizmodo that "some videos that cover subjects like health, politics and sexuality may not appear for users and institutions that choose to use this feature". Google also now provides a form where users can submit videos they believe should be available in restricted mode, which it says will be used to improve its automated systems. Gizmodo asked Google for more specifics on changes it made to its automated systems, but had not heard back at time of writing. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Are you planning to buy a new Samsung smartphone soon? Google Play Music may become your go-to music player. Google has teamed up with Samsung to make Google Play Music the default music player on new Samsung phones and tablets around the world, including the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, which launch today. Google also teased some "special" Google Play Music features just for Samsung customers. "For starters, if you have a new Samsung phone or tablet, you can now upload and stream up to 100,000 of your own songs to Google Play Music for free," Google Play Music Lead Product Manager Elias Roman wrote in a blog post. Google lets everyone else add up to 50,000 songs to Play Music for free. Related The Best Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ Cases The Best Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ Cases New Samsung phones and tablets will come with a free three-month trial of Play Music, up from the usual 30-day trial, and access to YouTube Red for commercial-free videos. After that, you'll have to pay $10 a month if you want to listen without ads and download your music for offline access. Google Play Music will also work with Samsung's new virtual assistant Bixby when it launches later this spring. This means you'll be able to ask Bixby to play a certain track and it will start streaming the jam right away via Play Music. Google Play Music got a "good" rating in PCMag's review. We noted that Google Play Music, "with its music locker and YouTube integration, offers more unique features than your typical streaming music service." On the down side, our reviewers found it annoying to set up, and lamented that it doesn't offer lyrics and is missing a few "essential" albums.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

View All Editorials → For the Most Private Browsing Experience, Think Epic Browser Jeff Butts @clefmeister · +Jeff Butts 2 minute read Apr 21st, 2017 5:32 PM EDT | Product News In the browser war, most of the emphasis is placed on the Big Three. Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox are the most well known, and each offers ways to protect your privacy and security. None of them are perfect, unfortunately, as we saw yesterday when we learned about the Punycode phishing attack. One lesser-known browser is better at privacy and security, though. That’s the Epic Privacy Browser. Apple’s website, as viewed in Epic Privacy Browser What Is Epic Privacy Browser? This is a browser built on Chromium, the open-source project forming the basis for the Google Chrome browser. Epic Privacy Browser features an always-on privacy mode, an encrypted proxy, tracker and cookie blocking, and more. It is billed as featuring “the most comprehensive local private browsing in any browser.” Epic Privacy Browser provides a good experience while still giving you private browsing My Browser Has Privacy Mode, So Isn’t That Good Enough? Maybe, maybe not. Even with private browsing mode, or incognito mode, turned on, you’re still being tracked and information is still left behind on your computer in some form or fashion. Google tracks you, your internet service provider does it, the government keeps an eye on your browsing history, and so do hundreds of other data collectors. This all happens even when incognito or other private browsing modes are turned on. Epic Privacy Browser prevents much of that, and it also deletes a ton of cached information and cookies every time you close it down. What Kind of Stuff Do Browsers Track? It’s not just the browsers, but the search engines, too. The bad thing is, you don’t even know they’re tracking you. Google and others track where and what you browse on the internet for purposes ranging from targeted ads to determining what your birthday is. Epic Privacy Browser actively blocks thousands of those trackers, and informs you of the fact. Know when a website is trying to track you What Is This, a TMO Ad for Epic Privacy Browser? You might think so, but let me put your mind at ease. Epic is far from perfect, and there are things that simply don’t work at all in the browser. First of all, Netflix is a no-go on Epic, because Google has ended support for the Silverlight plugin—which Netflix requires—on Chrome and Chromium. A plugin called Widevine is what Google uses in Chrome to support Netflix and others. So far, Google has refused to provide that plugin to Chromium developers, so Netflix won’t work under Epic. Then there are the crashes. Several times a day, I have to force-quit Epic Privacy Browser. The developers say a fix is coming for that within a couple of weeks, but it’s still a problem now. Clicking links in email and other programs is also a problem, but that’s another one that the developers are fixing for the next version of Epic. Links in Epic itself work fine, of course. I’ve also noticed that Epic Privacy Browser is a bit slower to load pages, likely because of the effort it’s putting into identifying and blocking trackers and certain cookies. Final Thoughts on Epic Privacy Browser If you’re concerned with your privacy you might be willing to compromise a bit in your browsing experience. If so, Epic is fairly decent. It’s not perfect, but I’m willing to continue using it simply because it takes away many concerns. Previously, I had to put in quite a bit of thought about my privacy and security. I’m not exactly the type to wear a tin-foil hat (no offense to those who do), but I do worry about the security of my data as well as my privacy. With Epic Privacy Browser, I can do what the tagline at the top of a blank tab in Epic says. I can breathe free, knowing that my browsing is private. Epic Privacy Browser is available for Mac and Windows, and costs nothing. On top of browser choice, you should also think carefully about doing a security checkup on your Mac.

Home’s in-built assistant can now learn the voices of up to six people, although not whilst they’re talking at once, thanks to neural network learning. How to add extra users? Google explains: When you connect your account on a Google Home, we ask you to say the phrases “Ok Google” and “Hey Google” two times each. Those phrases are then analyzed by a neural network, which can detect certain characteristics of a person’s voice. From that point on, any time you say “Ok Google” or “Hey Google” to your Google Home, the neural network will compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so it can understand if it’s you speaking or not. This comparison takes place only on your device, in a matter of milliseconds. Sorry, Burger King! China allegedly hacking South Korean missiles The Wall Street Journal is reporting that South Korean missile defences are being targeted by hackers linked to China’s military and intelligence agencies. China’s Ministry of Defense maintains that it “has never supported any hacking activity.” Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More The country has apparently seen a “rise in the number and intensity of attacks” since it announced it was deploying the USA’s THAAD (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense) system. China is thought to oppose the deployment of THAAD because its radar is capable of seeing into Chinese territory from South Korea. Harry Huskey dies, aged 101 Computer design trailblazer Harry Huskey died on 9 April 2017 at his home in California. Aged 101, Dr Huskey was one of the last surviving members of the team at the University of Pennsylvania that created the pioneering Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) in the 1940s. ENIAC, which was 30 metres long and weighed 27 tonnes, is considered to be the world’s first general-purpose electronic digital computer. Dr Huskey went on to work with mathematician Alan Turing on his prototype of the Automatic Computing Engine (Ace) in 1947 and later helped to set up computer science departments in universities around the world.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide YouTube Makes 12 Million Videos Accessible in Restricted Mode Libby WatsonYesterday 5:51pm Filed to: Youtube lgbt 36 4 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink A still from a video previously filtered by Restricted Mode. YouTube. In March, LGBT YouTube creators criticized Google for hiding some of their videos in “Restricted Mode,” which filters potentially “mature” content. After initially downplaying the extent of the problem, Google issued a non-apology, then a slightly more apologetic non-apology, and finally posted a fuller actual apology on its blog. In that post, Google acknowledged “this feature isn’t working the way it should” and promised it was “going to fix” the issue. Advertisement Today, Google posted an update on changes it has made to restricted mode. The post doesn’t provide many specifics about how it has altered its filtering system, but claims those changes have added more than 12 million videos, “including hundreds of thousands featuring LGBTQ+ content.” 12 million is a lot of videos—though given that 400 hours of YouTube material are uploaded every minute, it’s a small fraction of the total number of videos. Still, it implies that something was pretty significantly wrong with the restricted mode algorithm. The post also goes into more detail about what specifically is restricted: content about drugs and alcohol (including drinking in the video), graphic descriptions of violence, “mature subjects” terrorism and war, swearing, and sex. The post says sex is “one of the more difficult topics to train our systems on” and that “overly detailed conversations about sex or sexual activity will likely be removed.” This goes at least a little way towards answering the criticisms creators had leveled back in March, when they accused Google of deeming all LGBT-themed discussion as sexually explicit, even when it was completely innocent—like Seaine’s video discussing her decision to come out as trans. Advertisement Previously, Google had told Gizmodo that “some videos that cover subjects like health, politics and sexuality may not appear for users and institutions that choose to use this feature.” Google also now provides a form where users can submit videos they believe should be available in restricted mode, which it says will be used to improve its automated systems. Gizmodo has asked Google for more specifics on changes it made to its automated systems, and will update if we hear back.

Fenwick led Google's spacecraft operations, while Trela was head of satellite engineering. Both Trela and Fenwick are reporting to Greg Duffy, the former co-founder of camera company Dropcam. What the two are doing at Apple is unclear, but Bloomberg speculates they're either working on satellites for image collection or satellites for communications. Rumors have suggested Apple is using a fleet of drones to collect data to improve Apple Maps, with the company having filed for an FAA permit to be able to fly drones for commercial purposes. Apple also acquired Aether Industries in 2015, a previously unknown purchase. Aether Industries develops high-bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. On its website, Aether Industries shows off a range of high-resolution aerial imagery and claims to provide a "full imaging and mapping solution for full color aerial images." There's also evidence Apple is interested in deploying satellites for communication purposes. Boeing has been working on sending more than 1,000 satellites into low-earth orbit for the purpose of providing broadband access, and the company has reportedly been in talks with Apple.The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Former Boeing executive James Bell also joined Apple's board of directors back in October of 2015, another potential link between Apple and Boeing. It continues to be unclear if Apple will get involved with Boeing's broadband endeavor, but it's easy to see why Apple might be interested with Boeing aiming for faster speeds than existing cellular systems. Apple and Google declined to comment on the hiring, while Fenwick, Trela, and Duffy did not respond to Bloomberg's request for comments.Tags: Google, satellite, Aether Industries, Apple acquisitions Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 8 hours ago< > Embed Apple Signals Interest in Internet Satellites 00:41 Apple's next big launch may be a literal one as the tech giant seemingly has an interest in internet-beaming satellites.

News Cyber Life It's not '1984'. But we're being watched 24/7. And some of us love it Forever under the looking glass Reuters At a time when there are cameras and sensors everyone, little goes unnoticed. At a time when there are cameras and sensors everyone, little goes unnoticed. (Reuters) Andreas Weigend At 6:45 A.M., the alarm on my mobile phone wakes me up. Eager to start the day, I carry my phone to the kitchen while I scan through my email and Facebook notifications. My phone’s GPS receiver and WiFi register the changes in location, logging my shift a few meters north and east. As I pour myself a cup of coffee and really start to get going, the phone’s accelerometer tracks how quickly I walk and the barometer registers when I’m going up the stairs. Because I have Google apps installed on my phone, Google has a record of all these data. After breakfast, I’m ready to make my way to Stanford University. The electricity company has put in a “smart” meter, which registers the decrease in electricity use as I turn off my lights and unplug my mobile devices. When I open the garage door, the meter detects the usage signature specific to it. Thus, as I pull my car out onto the street, my electricity provider has enough data to know I’m no longer at home. Stanford researcher Andreas Weigend Photo courtesy of Jens Braune del Angel Stanford researcher Andreas Weigend Stanford researcher Andreas Weigend (Photo courtesy of Jens Braune del Angel) When my phone’s signal gets picked up by different cellular signal towers, so does my mobile phone carrier. On the road, a camera installed on a street corner takes a photo of my license plate in case I speed through a red light. Thankfully, I’m on my best behavior today so I won’t be greeted with a ticket in the mail. But as I go on my way, my license plate is photographed again and again. Some of those cameras belong to the local government, while some belong to private companies that are analyzing the data to identify patterns of mobility—which they sell to police departments, land developers, and other interested parties. When I get to Stanford, I use the EasyPark app on my phone to pay the parking fee. The money is automatically debited from my bank account, and the university parking team is notified that I’m paid up, so both the school and my bank can see that I’m on campus starting at 9:03 a.m. When my phone stops moving at a car’s pace, Google infers this is where I have parked and logs the location, so that I can look it up in case I forget later. It’s also time to check my Metromile insurance app, which has been recording data about my drive from the car’s on-board diagnostic system. I can see in an instant that my fuel efficiency was lower today—nineteen miles per gallon—and that I spent $2.05 on gas for my commute. After my day at Stanford, I’m planning to meet up with a new friend back in San Francisco. We “virtually” met each other when we both commented on a post by a mutual friend on Facebook, and liked each other’s take on the topic. It turned out we had more than thirty Facebook friends in common, more than enough reason to meet up. This is Andreas Weigend's new book, "Data for the People: How to Make Our Post-Privacy Economy Work Courtesy of Andreas Weigend This is Andreas Weigend's new book, "Data for the People: How to Make Our Post-Privacy Economy Work for You" This is Andreas Weigend's new book, "Data for the People: How to Make Our Post-Privacy Economy Work for You" (Courtesy of Andreas Weigend) Google Maps predicts that I’ll get to my new friend’s place at 7:12 p.m., and as usual the prediction is correct within a few minutes. As it happens, my friend lives above a store that sells tobacco products as well as various paraphernalia used for smoking marijuana. The GPS receiver on my smartphone doesn’t differentiate between the apartment and the store, however. As far as my carrier and Google are concerned, I’ve ended my day with a visit to the head shop—a fact revealed to me by the ads Google shows when I check the weather forecast before going to bed. GIVE TO GET Welcome to the social data revolution. Every day, more than a billion people create and share social data like these. Social data is information about you, such as your movements, behavior, and interests, as well as information about your relationships with other people, places, products, even ideologies. Some of these data are shared knowingly and willingly, as when you are signed in to Google Maps and type in your destination; others less so, often without much thought, part and parcel of the convenience of using the internet and mobile devices. In some cases, it is clear that sharing data is a necessary condition for receiving services: Google can’t show you the best route to take if you don’t tell it where you are and where you want to go. In other cases, you might happily contribute information, as when you “like” a friend’s Facebook post or endorse a colleague’s work on LinkedIn simply because you want to reach out and support her in some way. Social data can be highly accurate, pinpointing your location to within less than a meter, but social data are often sketchy, in the sense of being incomplete. For example, unless I sign in to an app that displays my smart meter’s readings (for instance, to be sure that I really did turn off all the lights in my house as I make my way to the airport), the electricity company knows when I am not at home, but nothing more than that. It’s a rough data point that may or may not be of much use to me. Similarly, as I was visiting my new friend in San Francisco, while my latitude and longitude were conveyed with precision, the inferences made about my activities that evening were utterly wrong. That’s even sketchier, in the sense that the data appeared quite exact but were very much an interpretation. Sketchy data have a tendency to be incomplete, error-prone, and—occasionally—polluted by fraud. Altogether—passive and active, necessary and voluntary, precise and sketchy—the amount of social data is growing exponentially. Today, the time it takes for social data to double in quantity is eighteen months. In five years, the amount of social data will have increased by about a factor of 10, or an order of magnitude, and after ten years, it will increase by about a factor of 100. In other words, the amount of data we created over the course of the entire year 2000 is now created over the course of a day. At our current growth rate, in 2020 we’ll create that amount of data in less than an hour. It’s essential to understand that “social data” isn’t merely some trendy buzzword for social media. Many social media platforms have been designed for broadcasting. In the case of Twitter, communication is almost always moving in one direction, from a celebrity, authority, or marketer to the masses. Social data is far more democratic. You may share information about yourself, your company, your accomplishments, and your opinions through Twitter or Facebook, but your digital traces are much deeper and broader than that. Your searches on Google, your purchases on Amazon, your calls on Skype, the minute-by-minute location of your mobile phone—all these and many more sources come together to produce a unique portrait of you as an individual. Further, social data doesn’t end with you. You create and share data about the strength of your relationships with family, friends, and colleagues through your communication patterns; you create data along side friends and strangers alike—for instance, when reviewing a product or tagging a photo on Instagram. You verify your identity when you set up an account on Airbnb, the platform for renting a room or house, using your Facebook profile in addition to a government-issued ID. Social data are becoming embedded in homes with smart thermostats, in cars with navigational systems, and in workplaces with team-based software. Such data are beginning to feature in our classrooms and doctors’ offices. As mobile phones get loaded up with more sensors and apps, and new devices start tracking your behavior at home, in the mall, and on the job, you’ll have less and less ability to control the data that describe your daily routine—as well as your deepest wishes. Data scientists become detectives and artists, painting iteratively clearer sketches of human behavior from our digital traces. These digital traces are examined and distilled to uncover our preferences, reveal trends, and make predictions, including about what you might buy. During my tenure as chief scientist of Amazon, I worked with Jeff Bezos to develop the company’s data strategy and customer-centric-culture. We ran a series of experiments to see if customers were happier with their purchases when they were shown editor-written versus consumer-written product reviews, and whether recommendations based on traditional demographic profiling or individual clicks were more successful. We saw the power of genuine communication over manufacturer-sponsored promotions. The personalization tools we created for Amazon fundamentally changed how people decide what to purchase and became the standard in e-commerce. Since leaving Amazon, I have taught courses on “The Social Data Revolution” to thousands of students, from undergraduates and graduate students at Stanford and the University of California–Berkeley to Chinese business students at Fudan University and China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, and Tsinghua University in Beijing. I also continue to run the Social Data Lab, a group of data scientists and thought leaders that I founded in 2011. Over the past decade, in my work with corporations ranging from Alibaba and AT&T to Walmart and UnitedHealthcare, and at major airlines, financial services firms, and dating sites, I have been an advocate for sharing the decision-making power of data with customers and users—regular people like you and me. No single person can wade through all of the data available today in an effort to make what we used to call an “informed” decision about some aspect of life. But who will have access to the tools that are necessary for leveraging data in service to our problems and needs? Will the preferences, trends, and predictions extracted from data be available to only a few powerful organizations, or will they be available for anyone to use? What price will we have to pay to secure the dividends of our social data? As we discover the value of social data, I believe we must focus not just on access but also on actions. We face some decisions many times each day, others just once in a lifetime. Indeed, the social data we create today have a long shelf life. The way we behave today may influence the choices we face in the decades to come. Few people have the ability to observe everything they do, or to analyze how their behavior might affect them, in the short or long term. Social data analysis will allow us to better identify the possibilities and probabilities, but the final choice must be deliberate. One thing these technologies cannot do is decide what sort of future we want—as individuals or a society. The laws in place that protect individuals in many countries from discrimination in the workplace or health care may not exist tomorrow—and in some countries, they do not exist even today. Imagine that you opt to share that you’re worried about having high cholesterol with a health app or site in order to get advice about diet and exercise regimens. Could your worries be used against you in some way? What if the law made it permissible to charge you a higher rate for medical care if you refused to stop eating deep-fried food and slouching on the couch after you’ve been presented with a menu of your health risks and recommendations for healthier choices? What if a manager used a service to crawl the web for information about you, and then, based on what he learned, decided that your lifestyle isn’t a good match for a job at his company and he won’t consider your application? These are real risks. If the sole person creating and sharing data about you was yourself, you might be able to withhold information that you thought might be risky. It would cost you a lot of convenience, but it could be possible. However, we do not live in such a world. You have no control over much of the data about you. This fact will become more palpable as social data are utilized by businesses and governments to improve effectiveness and efficiency. Because social data are so democratic, the questions about how best to handle it touch each and every one of us. Technology is moving fast, and the companies that collect and analyze our data are primarily in the business of creating and coding information, not creating and codifying principles. Many of those questions are being considered on an ad hoc basis, if they’re being considered at all. We should not leave decisions about principles that will deeply influence our future in the hands of the data companies. We can agree to have all of these data collected, combined, aggregated, and analyzed so that we are in a better position to understand the tradeoffs in decision-making. Human judgment is crucial to evaluating the trade-offs intrinsic to any important decision. Our lives should not be driven by data. They should be empowered by data. PRINCIPLES FOR THE POST-PRIVACY AGE As we’ve come to appreciate the increasing role of data in life, there have been several efforts to safeguard citizens’ interests. In the 1970s, the United States and Europe adopted broadly similar principles for the fair use of information. Individuals were told they had a right to know who collected what data about them, and how these data were being used.They could also correct data about themselves that were inaccurate. These protections are perversely both too strong and too weak for the world of new data sources and analytics that is being built today. They’re too strong because they assume it’s possible to keep tabs on all the data collected about you. Amazon might be able to explain in accessible terms exactly how the data the company collects about you are used. It might even be able to do so in a way that helps you make better decisions. But reviewing all this information would require investing a lot of time. How many of us would take the time to trawl through all the relevant data? Would it be useful to you to see how Amazon weighs each data point, or would you prefer to get a summary? At the same time, these protections are too weak, because even if you could check every bit of data you have created and shared about yourself, you will not get a full picture of the data about you, which includes data created and shared by others, such as your family, friends, colleagues, and employers. The businesses you visit online, as well as most of those you visit in the physical world, also create (and sometimes share) data. That goes for strangers on the street and a number of other organizations, public and private, with which you interact. Who decides whether these data are accurate or inaccurate? Because data today come from so many perspectives, having the right to correct data about yourself doesn’t reach nearly far enough. Finally, even accurate data can be used against you.With the massive quantitative and qualitative shifts in data creation, communication, and processing, the right to know and the right to correct are clearly insufficient. Thus far, the attempts to update these guidelines have focused almost entirely on maintaining individual control and privacy. Unfortunately, this approach is borne out of ideals and experiences that are technologically a century out of date. Standards of control and privacy also force individuals to enter an unfair contract with data companies. If you want your decision-making to be improved by data, you usually have to agree to having your data collected on the data collector’s terms. Once you’ve done that, the data company has satisfied the legal requirement to give you individual “control,” regardless of how much choice you really had or the effects on your privacy. I f you want to maintain personal privacy, you can instead withhold your consent to data collection and forfeit your access to relevant data products and services, reducing the value you get from your data. Enjoy your individual control then. Today, what we need are standards that allow us to assess the risks and rewards of sharing and combining data, and provide a means for holding companies accountable. After two decades working with data companies, I believe the principles of transparency and agency hold the most promise for protecting us from the misuse of social data while increasing the value that we are able to reap from them. Transparency encompasses the right of individuals to know about their data: what it is, where it goes, and how it contributes to the result the user gets. Is the company observing you from the “dark” side of a one way mirror, or does it also give you a window with a view to what it does with your data, so that you can judge whether (and when) the company’s interests are aligned with your own? How much data about yourself do you have to share to receive a data product or service that you want? Historically, there has been a strong information asymmetry between institutions and individuals, with institutions having the advantage. Not only do institutions have more capacity to collect data about you, they can interpret your data in comparison to others’ data. The balance between what you give and what you get needs to be clear to you. Consider how transparency is designed into the shopping experience at Amazon compared to the traditional relationship between customers and retailers. When you are about to buy an item, should a retailer remind you that you already bought it, potentially losing a sale in the process? At Amazon, if you try to buy a book you’ve already bought from the site, you’re greeted with the query “Are you sure? You bought this item already, on December 17, 2013.” If you buy a track from an album of music and then decide to buy the rest of it, Amazon will “complete the purchase,” automatically deducting the amount you have already spent on the track from the current price for the album. Amazon surfaces and uses data about your purchasing history in these ways because the company wants to minimize customer regret. Likewise, many airline frequent flyer programs now send you a reminder that your miles are about to expire rather than letting them quietly disappear from the company’s books. Unfortunately, transparency is far from the norm. Consider the far-too-typical experience of calling your favorite customer service center. At the start of the call, you’ll inevitably receive the warning: “This call maybe recorded for quality assurance purposes.” You’ve got no choice: you must accept the company’s conditions if you want to talk to a representative. Okay, but why is that recording accessible only to the business? What, really, does “quality assurance purposes” mean when only one side of the conversation is assured access to the record of what was agreed? The principle of data symmetry would also give you, the paying customer, access to the recording. Whenever I hear that my call might be recorded, I announce to the customer service rep that I might also record the call for quality assurance purposes. Most of the time, the rep plays along. Occasionally, however, the rep hangs up. Of course, I could record the call without asking for the rep’s permission—which, I should note, is against the law in some places. Then, if I don’t get the service I was promised, I could appeal to a manager with my evidence in hand. If that still didn’t work, I could upload the audio file in the hopes that it might go viral and the company feels pressured to fix things quickly—as Comcast did when a customer tried to cancel services but was rebuffed again and again, finally succeeding after his recording started trending on Twitter. You shouldn’t have to break the law to level the playing field in this way. To make transparency the new default, you need more information to be public, not less. But transparency isn’t enough; you also need agency. Agency encompasses the right of individuals to act upon their data. How easy is it for you to identify the data company’s “default” settings, and are you allowed to alter them for whatever reason you like? Are you able to act upon the data company’s outputs in any way you choose, or are you gently nudged (or forcefully pushed!) toward only some options—mostly the options that are best for the company? Can you play with the parameters and explore different scenarios to show a smaller or bigger range of possibilities? Agency is an individual’s power to make free choices based on the preferences and patterns detected by data companies. This includes the ability to ask data companies to provide information to you on your own terms. On a fundamental level, agency involves giving people the ability to create data that are useful to them. Amazon whole heartedly embraced uncensored customer reviews. It didn’t matter to the company if the reviews were good or bad, five stars or one, written out of a desire to gain approval from others or to achieve a lifelong dream of becoming a book critic. What mattered was their relevance to other customers who were trying to figure out what to purchase. Reviews revealed whether a customer regretted a purchase even though she did not return the item for a refund. These data helped customers decide if a recommended product was the best choice for them. Amazon gave customers more agency. Many marketers talk about targeting, segmentation, and conversion. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to be targeted, segmented, or sliced and diced. These aren’t expressions of agency. We can’t assume that the leaders of every company will, on their own, embrace the principles of transparency and agency. We must also go beyond these principles: we need delineated rights that help to spell out how to translate transparency and agency into tangible, hands-on tools. If we can get data companies to agree to a set of meaningful rights and tools, it will lead to what I call “sign flips”—reversals in the traditional relationships between individuals and institutions. Amazon’s decision to let customers write most of the content about products is a sign flip, and the social data revolution will provide many more similar opportunities. As individuals gain more tools to help them make better decisions for themselves, old-fashioned marketing and manipulation are becoming less effective. Gone is the day when a company could tell a powerless customer what to buy. Soon, you will get to tell the company what to make for you. In some places, you already can. Sign flips are an important element in how physicists see the world. They are often associated with phase transitions, where a change in an external condition results in an abrupt alteration in the properties of matter—water changing from a liquid into a gas when it is heated to the boiling point. The effect on society of the increasing amount of data can be compared to the increasing amount of heat on a physical system. Under certain conditions—when data companies provide transparency and agency for users—a sign flip will take place that favors the individual over the institution; that is, it will benefit you, not the company, or the company’s chief marketing officer. We the people all have a stake in the social data revolution. And if you want to benefit from social data, you must share information about yourself. Period. The value you reap from socializing data often comes in the form of better decision-making ability, when negotiating deals, buying products and services, getting a loan, finding a job, obtaining education and health care, and improving your community. The price you pay and the risks you take in sharing data must at least be offset by the benefits you receive. Transparency about what data companies are learning and doing is essential. So, too, is your ability to have some control over data products and services. Otherwise, how could you possibly judge what you give against what you get? BALANCING THE POWER Information is at the center of power. Those who have more information than others almost always stand to benefit, like the proverbial used-car salesman who pushes a lemon on an unwitting customer. As communication and processing have become cheap and ubiquitous, there’s a lot more data—and a lot more risk of substantial information imbalances, since no individual can get a handle on all the data out there. Much of the data being created and shared is about our personal lives: where we live, where we work, where we go; who we love, who we don’t, and who we spend our time with; what we ate for lunch, how much we exercise, and which medicines we take; what appliances we use in our homes and which issues animate our emotions. Our lives are transparent to the data companies, which collect and analyze our data, sometimes engaging in data trafficking and too often holding data hostage for use solely on their terms. We need to have some say in how our data are changed, bartered, and sold, and set more of the terms on the use of our data. Both sides—data creator and data company—must have transparency and agency. This will require a fundamental shift in how we think about our data and ourselves. Excerpted from “Data for the People: How to Make Our Post-Privacy Economy Work for You” by Andreas Weigend.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 15 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 6 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 43 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 26 [Deal Alert] 23 temporarily free, 2 cheap, and 5 on-sale apps for your Wednesday 2017/04/19 3:45pm PDTApr 19, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Loading video... How To Video How to add multiple users to Google Home With multiuser support, the Google Home is now more personal than ever. It can now give personalized responses based on whose voice it hears. 2:21 / April 20, 2017 Transcript One of the biggest gripes with Google Home to date was its lack of support from multiple accounts. Living in a household with multiple people means you had to share things like calendar and music accounts or get multiple Google home speakers. Today, Google fixes that. Google Home now supports multiple accounts with personalization and neural network voice recognition Here's how to set it up. When you open the Google home app you should see a notification that says mutli-user is now available. If you don't see that notification tap the device's button of a television and speaker in the top right corner. Tap the action overflow button in the top right corner of the card for your Google home and select settings. You should see a notification there that also says mutli-user is now available. You can also get to the Setup Menu by going to Devices settings, more and choose devices. Click the plus sign in the bottom right corner, to begin set up. Tapping one og these notifications will begin the process of teaching assistant your voice. You must say the phrases, hey, Google and okay Google twice, each. Tap continue then tap invite if you wanna add someone else to the Google Home. Additional user will need to download google home app and go to the same set of process but since their account might not have already been connected they will need to link their own user account and personalized the google home preferences to their liking. customized to the new sources, linking net account and clicking w hat their my day may includes. This also means to add more home devices to their account as well. This keeps just anyone from joining your Google Home and being able to control your smart devices. To set up another account from the same device, open the Google Home app and hit the hamburger button in the top left corner. Select the drop down to select an already connected account or hit manage account and add account to assign a new one. Then go through the same setup process. Up to six accounts can be added to a single Google Home. You can see all the active accounts in the Google Home by going to devices, settings, and linked accounts. There, you can remove your account, but you can not remove other accounts. Once more than one user is set up on a Google Home speaker, nothing needs to be done to switch between accounts, since Assistant has learned each of the user's voices. When you say things like Tell me about my day, your personal calendar and traffic report will be referenced. When you ask to play music, your preference of music service will play by default.

It seems like Google has decided to start celebrating this occasion a little early. In a post on the company's official blog, Kate Brandt, Google's Lead for Sustainability, points out that when using Search, you will be presented with a series of quick steps you can take in order to reduce your environmental impact. Moreover, if you search for a query such as "earth day" or similar, Brandt pointed out you will be presented with a carrousel of posts, which contain information on "Earth Day events, museum exhibits from Oakland to Switzerland, and history of how Earth Day came to be from the History Channel". To also emphasize the technology component of the firm's efforts, the executive was quick to point out Google's Made with Code program, which has launched a new environment coding project. In essence, it's there to attract teenage girls to writing code by using the Blockly coding language. With it, they can code personalized statements in support of the WWF, The Ocean Agency, and the Jane Goodall Institute. Since it also handles vast amounts of data, and therefore needs quite a few datacenters, the last emphasized point was that the search giant is on track for 100% renewable energy-powered operations this year, as announced back in December. The company is also committed to making their datacenters even more efficient, and as such more environmentally friendly, by use of AI. What will you do to celebrate Earth Day this year?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest Why users have mixed feelings about Cortana Kayla Matthews@KaylaEMatthews April 21, 2017 2:08 PM Image Credit: Shutterstock.com/yougoigo Launching a new product feature is hard — remember Clippy from Microsoft Word? To follow Windows 8 with a successful new OS was of utmost importance for Microsoft, but when you’re the 800-pound gorilla in the market, you’ve got to take risks even when the stakes are high. Rolling out Cortana, an interactive digital assistant similar to Apple’s Siri, as part of Windows 10 was a move that could have backfired on Microsoft easily. Luckily for the Seattle-based software powerhouse, Windows 10 is gaining ground on its own Windows 7 as the world’s most popular OS, and users appear to have taken a real liking to the blue-hued digital assistant. Yet Cortana hasn’t been as popular as other voice assistant products. A small 2015 survey conducted by AYTM found that 62 percent of respondents had used Siri, 40 percent had used Google Now, and only 24 percent had used Cortana. However, that was nearly two years ago. Today, Cortana’s user base has grown, but the app still isn’t quite as popular as one might imagine, considering hundreds of millions of people have access to it in their Windows 10 taskbar. So what’s the deal, Cortana? The voice command of a generation When Apple first released the Siri feature on its iPhone line of products, people weren’t familiar with the concept of a digital assistant, or confident that their voice commands would actually produce the results they wanted. That was 2011, and Siri didn’t make a splash right away, but as voice recognition technology has improved, users have become more comfortable using it. Microsoft primed the market for Cortana by introducing her as the AI in their popular line of Halo video games, introducing the female assistant to over 60 million Halo players before she joined Windows. If you need proof that the setup was successful, look no further than Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s announcement from the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. He shared that Cortana is seeing more than 100 million monthly active users, and the system has fielded 8 billion questions to date, of which more than 6 billion were voice queries. How are people using Cortana? The digital assistant is most often used for common tasks. Like her counterparts Siri and Alexa, Cortana can access the internet and quickly find answers to common questions, but she has a few tricks up her sleeve, too. Cortana can help you plan a trip, add new items to your calendar, or compose a quick message to your friend. This last functionality brings Windows up to speed with macOS, which has offered the capability to share SMS messaging duties with a user’s iPhone for several years now. The technology integrates with non-Microsoft apps, too. In addition to offering a number of features that take advantage of Microsoft core products such as Office, Cortana can access popular programs like Google Chrome through the use of a plugin. Microsoft has made Cortana with scalability in mind, and with the funding power of a world software leader behind it, Cortana has a chance to make significant strides against the competition from rivals Google and Apple. What do people wish Cortana could do? It’s easy to make demands of a digital assistant, and some are more reasonable than others. People can be creative with what they expect of Cortana, but the future of digital assistants can only mean more functionality, so ask away, right? Contextual awareness — the ability to answer questions posed in conversational form — is a feature that must be on the list for developers at Microsoft, Google, and Apple. For example, if you ask Cortana what a flight to New York costs on Friday, she’ll get back to you with an answer. However, if you add “What about on Saturday?” she won’t make sense of your request. Google Now is developing the ability to have its digital assistant interact with items you have on screen. For example, if it recognizes that you’re viewing a news article about Saturday Night Live, Google Now might offer to play the most recent episode’s video outtakes. Cortana doesn’t yet offer a similar feature. Some requests are more far-fetched. For example, some users would like Cortana to appear in her holographic blue form, as she did in the Halo video game series. That’s a feature we shouldn’t expect to see from Microsoft anytime soon. The future of Cortana With its trademark digital heroine in place on Windows and its mobile operating system, expect to see Microsoft start to push the feature more and more. It has yet to introduce Cortana in the car. Microsoft integrated systems are available, but none make use of the digital assistant. As Cortana becomes more feature rich and is able to access a wider selection of apps, the prospect of an entirely voice-activated technology experience becomes much closer to reality. Voice recognition is already improving rapidly, and with a complete line of entertainment, communication, and transportation devices, Microsoft has a great foothold to deploy Cortana as a holistic solution and tie into IoT devices.

[Photo: courtesy of Hachette Book Group] By Marcus Baram04.21.17 | 5:00 pm More than most people, Jonathan Taplin has seen firsthand how the rise of digital behemoths like Google and Facebook has irrevocably transformed the life of artists and musicians. advertisement A former tour manager for Bob Dylan and the Band and a movie producer for Martin Scorsese, Taplin has become an expert in digital media, and has observed how the original decentralized vision of the internet in the 1990s has morphed into an industry controlled by monopolistic companies that wield inordinate influence over the future of music, film, television, book publishing, and journalism. This concentration of power has decimated those industries—newspaper and music revenues have plummeted 70% since 2001, while Google’s YouTube pays for only 11% of the total streaming-audio revenues received by artists though it controls 60% of the streaming-audio business, according to Taplin. Taplin, who now spends his time focused on the challenges that new methods of distribution present to creative types, sits on California’s Broadband Task Force and is the director emeritus of the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab. He just came out with a new book, Move Fast and Break Things whose subtitle sums up his thesis with a punch to the gut of Silicon Valley’s self-righteous posture: “How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture And Undermined Democracy.” This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Fast Company: Reading your bio, I was struck by the fact that you co-produced one of my favorite movies, Wim Wenders’s Until The End of the World. And now I need to see it again, because I totally forget how everyone carries around these handheld screens and can’t help getting lost in watching old videos from their past. That movie came out over 25 years ago, and it was so prescient. Jonathan Taplin: We’re trying to get the studio to release the full five-hour version—Wim and I are trying to get the long version of it released. They’re open to it. We have to have a negotiation. FC: What prompted you to write this book? JT: Ironically, it was at a Fast Company conference back in 2012, where I was debating Alexis Ohanian of Reddit about artists’ rights. And he was saying that artists don’t have the right to make money from recorded music but to make money as live performers. And he was so proud of how he gets all this music for free. So I told him the story of Levon Helms, who was literally fighting for his life while this conference was going on. He got throat cancer. When Napster arrived, all those royalties took a hit and that very point he got throat cancer. And he didn’t even have enough money to pay for health insurance. Some friends got together and organized what became known as the Midnight Rambles, and put on shows in his barn and people would pay some money, and that sustained him for a while. And then he died. After he died, there was a benefit for his wife. And it seemed so unfair. advertisement And here you have [Alexis] saying that artist should make money as they did in the 18th century. Meanwhile, we have 5 billion smartphones in the world, and he’s telling me we can’t make money off of that? It’s not like there isn’t money available. And I looked at it and saw that what happened was that the big monopoly platforms were getting all the money. On the Amazon side, they’re what’s known as a monoposony [a market situation in which there is only one buyer], as the middle man forcing lower prices. Essentially, the artists got screwed. With the advent of YouTube and other streaming services, revenue for musicians has fallen 70%. FC: I was reading somewhere that Daft Punk only got something like $13,000 from Spotify for “Get Lucky,” which was streamed literally tens of millions of times. JT: Yeah, that’s right. If you had a song that had a million downloads on iTunes, you would get $900,000. On YouTube, you’d get $900. It just became clear to me that these three companies, Google, Facebook, Amazon, have such a dominant role—Amazon has 75% of the book business—that in any normal society these would be considered monopolies and we would want to do something about it. But that’s not how they feel. Peter Thiel says that competition is for losers. It came out of a incredibly libertarian point of view that Thiel, Bezos, and Larry Page all embraced, that this digital transformation only works if there’s no regulation and no taxes. And that attitude has had a huge impact. Jeff Bezos put 2,800 bookstores out of business … It’s made it very hard to make a living if you’re creating content. Authors are getting less money and book publishers have been devastated. In journalism, over half the journalists are out of the business. Jonathan Taplin [Photo: courtesy of Hachette Book Group]FC: How is it impacting film and TV? advertisement JT: The same piracy problems that existed in the music business are going to infect the film and TV business. HBO has a huge piracy problem: Half the viewers of Game of Thrones are not paying for it. The other problem? The whole fake news situation could not exist without Facebook and a Google AdSense account. Those kids in Macedonia making $6,000 a week, they had two tools—a Facebook page and a Google AdSense account. And that was enough to enable them to create this whole ecology. Now they’re starting to face pushback from advertisers over fake news and other content. Proctor & Gamble is just not interested in having ads next to ISIS videos. I’m going to Nashville tomorrow to talk to a reporter at the big local paper and he says, “Only in the last four years am I being judged by how many clicks and likes I get. This is all new to me, and I don’t like it. And I have to write stuff that is essentially clickbait.” And it’s happening all over. News organizations get more than 50% of their traffic from Facebook. FC: I strongly feel that the obsession with clickbait has helped create this distrust in the media. When even the Washington Post is doing clicky and hyberbolic headlines, people get turned off. They end up clicking but then they’re annoyed. They don’t want to be told what to think or what to feel—they just want the straight news. JT: That’s why the second part of the book’s title is “undermining democracy.” One way is exactly what you talked about. If nobody believes anything, then there’s no institution, whether the New York Times or Washington Post or Breitbart, that anyone has any trust in—and people throw them all in the same bag. And the second problem is that when you have so much monopoly power, you also have political power. The FTC was going to sue Google because it was killing services like Yelp, because when you search for something it would push you to the Google version of Yelp. And then the political connections put an end to that. People would make the argument that Eric Schmidt was essentially Obama’s chief of staff. The CTO of the White House was from Google. The regulatory capture was stunning and the politicians overruled the [FTC] staff. That’s political power. And the third thing, as [former Obama budget director Peter] Orszag and [former chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers Jason] Furman write, these big companies have also helped drive more economic inequality. If the top five corporations in the country are all tech companies, and the people who run them own gigantic shares of stock, it’s going to lead to economic inequality. FC: Isn’t that always the case? That the CEOs of the biggest corporations, whether it’s GM or Google, will have lots of power. advertisement JT: It’s different now. Take Rex Tillerson, when he ran ExxonMobil. If he owned 1% of the company, I would be shocked. The CEO of GE owns maybe 1% of the stock. But Mark Zuckerberg owns a huge chunk of Facebook, Jeff Bezos owns a giant share of Amazon. FC: It’s also so different because the classic giants employed so many more people. Walmart has 2.2 million employees, GM has a million, while Apple and Google have much smaller workforces. That increases income inequality because they’re worth billions, but they’re in these small enclaves in Silicon Valley and that wealth isn’t spread out across the country. And it also would seem to make the tech giants less aware of what’s happening in small towns in the Rust Belt. JT: Think about the number of people that GM hires—close to a million. Facebook has a far higher market cap than GM, and yet Facebook’s workforce is less than 20,000 [actually, 17,048 full-time employees as of December 2016]. Think about the amount of capital and the amount of net worth concentrated in Silicon Valley, it’s not spaced out anywhere. Yes, Amazon has warehouses everywhere, but the people who work there don’t earn much and they have to move from one place to another in a certain amount of seconds [referring to how warehouse workers are timed on certain tasks they perform]. A few years ago, it was so hot in one fulfillment center that they had to park ambulances outside to treat people who fainted instead of putting in AC. It is not helping society at large if there’s only a few places where this wealth is stored. FC: Do you think that Silicon Valley can help bridge the digital divide? JT: Not sure if that really helps. If you’re Mark Zuckerberg, you go on a PR tour and get your picture taken in the Deep South and pretend you know what’s really going on. Quite frankly, their biggest worry is PR. advertisement They’ve held on to this techno-determinism. Nobody has questioned their view of where the world is going, even to the level of asking, “What’s wrong with having robots do everything?” Who’s thinking about what happens when there are no jobs for people who haven’t gone to college? Marc Andreessen says we’ll come up with jobs that they haven’t thought of yet, but I haven’t seen examples of that yet except for people making money off that. FC: So, what are your solutions to these problems, especially for artists, from musicians to writers to filmmakers? JT: I’ve talked about resistance to this system. That takes many forms, like musicians insisting that their tunes not be on streaming services. At first, it depends on the ones who really have clout, like Taylor Swift and Beyonce. That’s a start. Then it moves to the possibility of removing the Safe Harbor provision that allows you to put up anything without anybody’s permission and you can’t sue them. That would make a big difference, taking down the terrorist videos and violent videos. If they had to take responsibility for what was on their platform like any TV station. If that [the Cleveland killing video that was uploaded to Facebook last weekend] happened on any TV station, the FCC would have taken away their license. And the third thing is antitrust. These people are such market fundamentalists, whenever Google gets in trouble with antitrust, they pay people to say switching costs is zero. That’s nonsense. I have all my data on Google, my calendar in Google—the switching costs are not easy. If Bill Gates spends maybe a billion dollars on Bing and it barely has 4% of the market, what rational person would decide to enter the search business? Maybe there is a natural monopoly. And if that’s the case, then there are other remedies like treating them like a utility and regulating them so. FC: To get back to this disconnect and the crisis of unemployed coal miners, Silicon Valley’s congressman Ro Khanna recently went to eastern Kentucky where he met with coal miners who are learning to develop mobile apps. Is that a start? JT: Let’s posit that I’m an autoworker and I’m in my early 50s and I got laid off because I was replaced by a robot. Is Google going to hire me as a coder? I don’t think so. First of all, they’re obsessed with hiring young people. Second thing is, and the election showed, these people in their 50s and 60s whose jobs are gone, they’re screwed by the global economy. And Silicon Valley doesn’t have answers for them. advertisement If you read Thiel, all he cares about is the entrepreneurs. He says that 98% of people don’t have a clue. It would take some political leadership. I read a quote from [Treasury Secretary] Steve Mnuchin, that he thought it would be 100 years before we have to worry about robots. These people are clueless, surrounded by people trading futures on Wall Street and they don’t realize that this isn’t 50 years ago. This is 5-10 years away when the autonomous truck business takes away 2 million jobs. There is hope. There are little signs of resistance everywhere. Last week [it was] reported that the New York Times told Facebook that they wouldn’t be in Instant Articles anymore. They realize that it’s just a trap that Facebook set for them. Once you get hooked on a monopoly, they get to determine how much you’ll get. That’s why a musician gets paid $900 for a million plays on YouTube.

How to add schema markup to your site using Google Tag Manager Want to add strucured data markup to your site, but don't have the access or the coding skills? No need to worry! Columnist Bryan Stenslokken shows you how to do this with Google Tag Manager in nine easy steps. Bryan Stenslokken on April 21, 2017 at 12:10 pm More The importance of schema.org has significantly grown in the SEO world since its introduction in 2011. Schema.org is a collection of schemas for structured data markup (sometimes called “schema markup”) that helps search engines better understand content on websites. Implementing this markup on a site can also improve how that site’s listings appear in SERPs. By properly implementing structured data markup from schema.org, you can gain a competitive advantage, increase click-through rate, drive additional traffic and cost-effectively improve organic search results. One way to implement schema markup is by directly tagging the HTML code on your web pages. However, this requires two things: Some basic coding knowledge CMS (Content Management System) access and/or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) access The challenge is that often, SEOs don’t have the required coding skills, and many companies have strict policies on who can access their site’s website files. No worries. This is where Google Tag Manager comes in handy. What is Google Tag Manager? Google Tag Manager is a free tool that allows marketers to add or update tags without having to know any website coding (or bother someone who does). In this case, we’re using it to add a snippet of code to the site — our structured data markup — without actually editing any of the website code. Following are eight simple steps to add schema markup to your website using Google Tag Manager. Specifically, in the example below, I show how to add organization schema markup that uses JSON-LD encoding. You can learn more about all of the various types of encoding that schema supports here. Please note: The steps below assume you already have Google Tag Manager set up. Step 1: Create JSON-LD markup If you do not have any JSON-LD encoding knowledge, then head on over to SchemaApp.com to use their JSON-LD schema generator tool. All you have to do is enter the properties you want to include in your schema markup (some are mandatory), then copy the JSON-LD code to your clipboard.   Step 2: Create new Custom HTML Tag Create a new custom HTML tag in Google Tag Manager and name it something descriptive, like: “Organization Schema Markup.”   Step 3: Paste JSON-LD markup into the Custom HTML text box Step 4: Save your Custom HTML tag Click the blue “save” button on the top right-hand corner of your screen. A pop-up message will appear stating “No Triggers Selected,” but go ahead and click the gray “save tag” button.   Step 5: Create new trigger for Page Views Next, you will need to create a new trigger for your tag to fire on. You’ll want to select the page views trigger from the list on the right-hand side of your screen. Name the trigger “Page View.” You can use this trigger for other tags, too (tags that require page views in order to fire). Step 6: Configure ‘Page View’ trigger Next, you will need to configure the page views trigger that you just created so that it fires on all page views, then click “save.” Step 7: Connect ‘Page View’ trigger to your schema markup tag Open the Organization Schema Markup custom HTML tag that you created in step 2, choose the “Page View” trigger to make the tag fire, then click the blue “save” button. Step 8: Publish your Google Tag Manager container Click the red “publish” button in the top right-hand corner. Step 9: Test your markup using Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool Finally, you’ll want to test your schema markup using the Structured Data Testing Tool to make sure it validates. Summary I encourage all marketers to capitalize on the potential benefits provided by structured data markup. Even if you’re not familiar with the required HTML code, or if you can’t access the needed web files, you can take advantage of this simple implementation method using Google Tag Manager. Structured data markup is an important aspect of any comprehensive SEO solution. I recommend that you implement the schema types that are most applicable to your business. This will likely provide a competitive edge in the SERPs, and it is a cost-effective way to boost your organic search results.

Contributor Jordan Kasteler outlines 5 things you should be doing and shares tools to help you accomplish these tasks. Jordan Kasteler on April 21, 2017 at 2:51 pm More You might disagree, but I see Search Engine Optimization as both an art and a science. You need to be creative in your approaches to please search engines and outsmart competitors while also applying solid research and analytics-based strategies. To do this, you need to employ a variety of techniques and tools. Unfortunately, however, most people tend to stick to what they know. That can be dangerous in the rapidly evolving SEO space, as the search engines continually adjust what they’re looking for and how they display results. Following, some of the significant — but sometimes forgotten — levers you can pull to enhance your SEO efficiency Keyword grouping Keyword grouping refers to the organization of keywords into clusters for a variety of purposes — to inform your site’s information architecture, to optimize landing pages, to identify potential areas of content development opportunity and more. But organizing your search keywords into the most valuable groups can be a difficult task, even for a seasoned guru. While different SEOs and tools take a variety of approaches, I find it best to unite keywords into clusters based upon whether queries using them results in similar URLs appearing in the top 10 results in Google. If you have many landing pages to work with, it can be a weighty task to make reports, optimize and manage your SEO projects. As the keyword landscape is always changing, you need a tool and a solid strategy to cope with the challenges. Benefits of keyword grouping A keyword grouping strategy allows you improve your SEO and PPC workflow and get a better understanding of how each type of a keyword is working for you. It helps with on-page SEO optimization, copywriting, topic selection and organizing your website architecture. You can prioritize your landing page creation based on what seem to be the most promising keyword groups. Many webmasters use Excel or AdWords Editor to group big collections of keywords into smaller and more targeted lists, but it’s easy to make mistakes when working manually with large volumes of data. Using special tools for keyword grouping — such as SE Ranking Keyword Grouper or Wordstream Keyword Grouper — speeds up the process tremendously while maintaining quality and efficiency. Of course, no tool is perfect. It still takes a careful eye and some spreadsheet skills to make the groups perfect. Page change monitoring Monitoring page changes is a new tactic for me, but I find it’s absolutely crucial to SEO. With page change monitoring tools, you can receive alerts about any changes on the pages you are optimizing. If you’re a small business owner who is the only one touching your pages, this tip isn’t for you. But it will be invaluable for those who work within large marketing teams and agencies on projects where the website is accessed by many webmasters, marketing experts or clients. When you monitor pages, you will always know when your client or a webmaster make a website change that will impact your rankings — and you’ll be able to make any necessary adjustments before your rankings drop or you get penalized by Google. We all know that even minor changes can have serious consequences, so it is really important to be aware of any adjustments before the pages are indexed by search engines. You can use a variety of tools and apps to set up alerts for any page changes. These include VisualPing and ChangeDetection.com. SE Ranking’s Page Change Monitoring also allows SEO experts to set a scan frequency and track and analyze the changes that occur between each scan. If your website is getting hacked, the feature will detect and show malicious code and bad links as well. You can monitor any pages — yours, clients’ or competitors’. Competitor SEO research Staying smart on the competitive landscape is critical for SEOs and marketers. Inform yourself by keeping track of your competitors’ marketing activities, starting from search rankings down to new content and links. Lots of tools can help you discover competitors’ keywords for organic search. SpyFu, SEMrush, BuzzSumo and Ahrefs are some of my favorites. As I mentioned briefly above, one often-overlooked tactic is to use a monitoring tool to spy on the changes (like new links or new content) competitors are making on their sites. This will allow you to discover what they are doing to generate quality traffic and let you develop your own outsmarting strategies based on those findings. Long-tail keyword variations Embracing long-tail keywords is vital for online businesses that want to get high rankings in organic Google searches. Long-tail keywords are often neglected because they initially get less traffic, but by cultivating those who search for these terms, you will get better results in the long run. That’s because these searchers — with their very specific lower-funnel queries — are exactly the target audience you are seeking. The challenge is to find profitable and useful long-tail keyword variations for your niche and your website. Luckily, a lot of keyword suggestion tools provide this feature for use in optimizing your pages. Some of the more well-known include Google’s Keyword Planner (in AdWords) and WordStream’s free keyword tool. Mobile rank tracking It’s impossible to ignore the incredible impact mobile devices are having in everyone’s daily lives, so mobile metrics are growing increasingly important. Though Google hasn’t yet fully rolled out its mobile-first index, it’s on the way. And the mobile-friendly algorithm is already in play. For these reasons, you’ll want to keep a close eye on your mobile rankings, and any mobile fluctuations and changes, as they occur. Using Google Search Console, you can check mobile rankings using the Search Analytics report. There, you can compare desktop and mobile rankings, looking at time frames, impressions and clicks for mobile rankings.   Comparing desktop and mobile ranking will allow you to quickly identify problems posed by the mobile-first index rollout. If a page is ranking significantly lower in mobile, look closely at the factors that might be less than mobile-friendly. There are also a variety of SEO platforms (too many to name) that provide info on mobile ranking, so consider utilizing these when optimizing for mobile search. You can import the results from multiple tools, including Google Search Console, into a keyword rankings dashboard to centralize your information in one place. Local keyword ranking If your products or services are of interest to folks in your geographical area, make sure you’re also optimizing for local searches. As people carry around their smartphones and perform searches while out and about, local search — like mobile — is becoming increasingly important. A challenge here is that proximity has been identified as a key factor in local search rankings, which means that different people in different places will receive different results for the same queries. Therefore, you need to employ tools that are designed especially to take on this task. Some possibilities include SERPs’ Keyword Rank Checker (which lets you input local parameters) and BrightLocal’s free localized ranking tool. Conclusion SEO is a dynamic marketing field, which makes it both challenging and exciting. The good news is that you can gain a competitive advantage if you keep up with the latest tools and techniques, such as the ones I’ve detailed here.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back.

Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it.

BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 107k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a $10 Target eGiftCard for $5 (for eligible Groupon members) 2017/04/21 9:19am PDTApr 21, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 5 [Deal Alert] Get the brand-new Sony Xperia XZs for $658 ($41 off) on Amazon 2017/04/21 8:10am PDTApr 21, 2017 43 Sprint offering two-for-one deal on Galaxy S8, but beware the fine print 2017/04/20 11:44am PDTApr 20, 2017 26 [Deal Alert] 23 temporarily free, 2 cheap, and 5 on-sale apps for your Wednesday 2017/04/19 3:45pm PDTApr 19, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

As part of a special partnership between Google and Samsung, S8 Google Play Music users will be able to store up 100,000, up from 50,000 compared to regular Play Music users, on Google’s servers. Each S8 also comes with a free three-month trial of Play Music. Per usual, the trial is only available to new Google Play Music subscribers, not those who may have paid for the service in the past and let their subscription lapse. Later this year, Google will also update Play Music to support Bixby, the S8’s new personal assistant, as well as to add other ‘special features’ just for Samsung smartphone customers. The former update will coincide with the launch of Bixby Voice, which is scheduled to come to Canadian S8 units sometime later this year. A spokesperson for Google confirmed to MobileSyrup that the offer is available to new Canadian S8 owners. Previous Galaxy devices came with Samsung’s Milk music app. Moving forward, Google Play Music will be the preferred music app on Samsung smartphones, according to the South Korean company. This marks a significant change for Samsung, which has had something of a seemingly acrimonious relationship with Google in recent years. Did you pick up a Galaxy S8 today?

This is thanks to Samsung and Google doing a deal which benefits both companies. Thankfully, you benefit too, that is if you own a new Samsung device. All new Samsung phones and tablets will now feature Google Play Music as their default music app. The Samsung Music app will still be available, but only as a download. For all intents and purposes, Samsung is pushing Google Play Music as the only music app you’ll ever need to use. The Benefits of Teaming Up With Google Samsung owners will get three distinct benefits over everyone else using Google Play Music: The first is the chance to upload 100,000 tracks to Google Play Music. Everyone else is limited to “just” 50,000 tracks. 100,000 tracks should be enough to accommodate most people’s music collections. The second is a free three-month trial to the paid version of Google Play Music. This gives you ad-free, on-demand access to 40 million songs and curated playlists.

Words like “SARMs” and “Ostarine” are getting up to 100,000 searches per month, according to the search engine giant. They join words like “protein,” which gets a healthy, whopping, nearly one million searches per month. That’s because folks are looking beyond things like adding protein to their diets via fish, chicken, and other meats — along with protein drinks — and cutting carbs, sugar and unhealthy fats in order to get the cut and lean look of Joakim Noah of the New York Knicks, as seen above. It turns out Joakim didn’t get that look totally from imbibing protein drinks. Instead, Noah faced a 20-game suspension with no pay because of LGD-4033, which is a SARM. According to the Chicago Tribune, the SARM, which stands for Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator, was discovered in Noah’s system. According to Google, LGD-4033 gets up to 100,000 searches per month. SARMs are a hot buzzword because online forums for bodybuilders call SARMs something similar to steroids, but aren’t steroids. SARMs have fewer steroid-related side effects. [Image by Nam Y. Huh/AP Images] On Instagram, the #SARMs hashtag currently contains 15,391 posts. Photos and videos of muscled people seem to suggest that SARMs do everything they promise, with the LGD-4033 supplement and other SARMS concoctions promising no ill side effects, except for the S4 SARM that has been linked to vision problems, as reported by Maxim. The publication notes that gym rats are taking SARMs like LGD 4033 and Ostarine, using themselves as human guinea pigs to see what types of muscle gains they can make, all the while cutting fat and praying for no side effects. Fitness people are willing to make themselves long-term study participants and praying for the best. What are SARMs? Like the name suggests, SARM select certain androgen receptors or NR3C4, to have an effect upon the androgenic hormones, testosterone, or dihydrotestosterone. Research on SARMs begins to get into the complex makeup of the body, and publications like Tiger Fitness have written about the potential drawbacks of SARMs. The government reported on at least one study on Ostarine with no side effects reported that has been used as the basis for many glowing reports about SARMs. As noted in the study, it was more than 10 years ago when 60 elderly men and women were given Ostarine and their lean body mass increased. “GTx, Inc. reported in December 2006 the results of this clinical trial, which was a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in sixty elderly men and sixty postmenopausal women [Dalton, 2007a; Dalton, 2007b]. Without a prescribed diet or exercise regimen, all subjects treated with OstarineTMhad a dose-dependent increase in total LBM, with the 3 mg/day cohort achieving an increase of 1.3 kg compared to baseline and 1.4 kg compared to placebo after 3 months of treatment. Treatment with OstarineTM also resulted in a dose-dependent improvement in functional performance measured by a stair climb test, with the 3 mg/day cohort achieving clinically significant improvement in speed and power. Interestingly, subjects treated with 3 mg/d of OstarineTM had on average an 11 percent decline in fasting blood glucose, a 17% reduction in insulin levels, and a 27% reduction in insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) as compared to baseline, suggesting that SARMs might have therapeutic potential in diabetics or people at risk for diabetes.” Overall, people are searching for the truth about SARMs through reviews from real users, which proliferate YouTube and other social media platforms talking about using SARMs on “rats” and “bunnies,” since the experts aren’t allowed to recommend SARMs usage for people. The SARMS that were discovered via pharmaceutical research to help cancer patients and others grow muscles or prevent them from wasting away has moved into the fitness world. [Image by Nam Y. Huh/AP Images] People share news about the Ostarine dosages they’ve tried via certain four-week or six-week or eight-week and even 12-week runs they’ve done on themselves or their fitness clients, seeking that holy grail combination of cutting fat while gaining muscle for a chiseled and lean look. The SARMS for fat loss seems apparent for some who’ve reported sweating more on SARMs and breaking through their personal limits of weightlifting. SARMS for weight loss and the side effects are still being documented by those online searching for how to take SARMS and the proper and effective dosages. Reportedly, some women do well on SARMs, without all the research of any long term effects known at this point. However, bodybuilding folks are feeling brave enough to take the risk based on the logs about SARMs already published. Since some steroids have been known to cause unwanted side effects, like hair loss, deeper voices, and effects upon libido or sexual performance, SARMs has become the hot new thing that may not make users suffer the same things. The truth about SARMs, when to take them and their overall effectiveness will be known over time. SARMs are being sold in various online markets, with complaints about some supplement makers sneaking SARM ingredients in supplements unbeknownst to those taking them.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Apple recruits top Google satellite executives for whole new hardware team Christian Zibreg on April 21, 2017 0 Mark Gurman and Mark Bergen, reporting Friday for Bloomberg, have learned from sources who didn’t wish to be named that Apple is in the process of starting a brand new hardware team for which it recruited a pair of top Google executives specialized in satellites for collecting images and those for communications. It’s unclear from the report what Apple’s secretive new hardware team might be focusing on, but it could be inferred from the hirings that Tim Cook & Co. might be considering a satellite constellation of their own for either image collection or some sort of communications services. Apple and satellite engineering John Fenwick, who led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, who was the search giant’s head of satellite engineering, left Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. for Apple in recent weeks. Both men joined Google in 2014 when it acquired their satellite-imaging startup Skybox Imaging for a reported $500 million. In 2017, Google sold Skybox to startup Planet Labs Inc. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University. The two former Google executives now report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam who joined Apple earlier this year to form a new team. He reports to Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple’s augmented reality efforts. The report notes that Google planned to invest $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler before it invested $1 billion in SpaceX after Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb Ltd. Considering Fenwick and Trela are experts in satellite design and operation, it’s reasonably safe to speculate that Apple could be looking to design or manage a satellite constellation. But why? The most likely answer: to boost Apple Maps with its own highly detailed satellite images, which could be very helpful should Apple decide to launch Maps web app in the future. Apple could also create its own Google Earth-like service, especially following the launch of the beautiful Google Earth web app earlier this week. For years, the iPhone maker has operated a fleet of airplanes that capture aerial images of major metropolitan areas and landmarks from multiple angles, used to create detailed 3D views of buildings and other objects on Maps. Apple goes Google Earth? The company also operates a fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans that roam the streets capturing data that helps improve Maps. I’m only speculating here, but those vehicles might be also taking street-level photographs that Apple could use for a Google Street View-like feature on Maps. Bloomberg in December said Apple even relies on a fleet of drones to update Maps information faster than the aforesaid minivans allow. The FAA granted the Cupertino company approval to operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography and videography.

"An incredible event for the entire region," said Gilman in the media release. "I know some in the global tech world were thinking 'well perhaps the Tesla deal was a one-off.'” Then TRI added Switch, the largest Colocation Data Storage Company on the globe, and heads turned, and now Google, TRI, Storey County, and Northern Nevada are in the center of the world stage for tech company development." "We've heard some tech media outlets are referring to the I-80/USA Parkway area as the 'Tech Corridor,' now that Google, Switch, Tesla, Apple and Rack Space are all in that vicinity. And don't forget, we are already home to tech giants like Zullily, Jet.com, and Amazon here in fulfillment center facilities." "Our phone started ringing off the hook the minute the Google deal hit the media," Gilman continued. "We had a call within 24 hours from one of the biggest software companies in the world wanting to take a look at us." "It is now a fact that all of Northern Nevada is tied closely together as a true trade area," said Gilman. "All the jobs TRI is bringing in will pour well over a billion dollars annually in payroll into the surrounding cities in what I call the 'Golden Circle.' This Golden Circle trade area is comprised of Reno and Sparks on the West, Carson City, Dayton, Silver Springs and Yerington on the South, and Fernley and Fallon in the East. And TRI and our Tech Corridor sits as the hub of this wheel. With the USA Parkway project being completed within the next four months, we now have supporting roads and highways interconnecting all these areas with the great tech jobs here at TRI. "We need to thank a lot of people," Gilman said. "I have to start by thanking Jeff Brigger at Nevada Energy (NVE), who referred this deal to us. Jeff is the best Economic Development expert I've ever met. Jeff had been working with them for several years before our introduction. And we need to thank Rob Roy and Adam Kramer at Switch who came in with a major assist that made this deal happen. We needed them and they came through with flying colors."

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back.

TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it.

I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

Google Maps v9.51 beta adds new details about parking, prepares to improve route planning with parking suggestions and traffic charts [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 11:17am PDTApr 21, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares113 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 New parking indicators 2 Teardown 2.1 Change your route to nearby parking 2.2 Traffic Histogram 3 Download It's time for another update to Google Maps. Like so many other version bumps, this one includes a couple of great gifts to get users where they want to go. The focus of this release appears to be directed at parking. There are now indicators to show if there is on-site parking and whether it's free or paid. The theme continues into the teardown with a feature that will help drivers plan to find parking near their destination before getting there. If you're already signed up to the beta, this update might already be waiting for you. Otherwise, you can hit the link at the bottom to download the apk. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Free / Paid indicator for parking on detail pages Destinations now show if there is on-site parking New parking indicators Google has been on a roll with parking-related features since they were introduced earlier this year. The latest update digs a bit deeper to inform drivers about the parking situation before getting to a destination. The first addition can be found in the details page, which indicates if parking at that location is free or paid. As the screenshot shows, the line can be found just below the address in most cases. However, parking details aren't available for very many locations yet, so you probably can't count on seeing it at most destinations. At this time, the field only shows if parking is free or paid, but doesn't appear to include prices for paid parking. To get prices, you'll probably still have to resort to other methods. Perhaps this will be added in a future update like it was with fuel prices. Left: previous version. Right: latest version. (Look for the red and blue markers.) The other adjustment comes in the form of a new type of parking difficulty indicator. In previous versions, Maps would show one of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Limited. The latest update adds On-site to the mix, which shows drivers if they can park at their destination or plan to search for a spot nearby. Unfortunately, this change does introduce something of a regression in usability. As the screenshots above show, the on-site indicator replaces the difficulty marker. If parking happens to be fairly terrible at your destination, you'll have no idea about that until you're driving around with no hope of finding an available space. Considering how much effort has gone into assessing parking difficulty, this will probably be fixed fairly soon. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Change your route to nearby parking Navigation apps are great for getting us to a place, but most of them have been designed with a bit of intentional tunnel vision. We might say we want to go to some place, but what we really mean is that we have to drive to a slightly different place to park, then walk (or whatever) to the real destination. The Google Maps developers are working to address this common scenario and help drivers make the decision to reroute to nearby parking. New text in the apk describes a feature that will prompt users to add a parking lot to their routes. Basically, it will offer to search for parking lots and garages near the destination and offer up a list. Users will then be able to pick a parking location, which will then be added to the route. code <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING">Adds the parking lot to the route.</string> <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING_LONG">Adds %1$s as a parking lot on the route</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING_NEAR_DESTINATION">Find parking near destination</string> <string name="ADD_PARKING">Add parking</string> <string name="EDIT_PARKING">Edit parking</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING">Find parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_QUERY">Parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_FAILED">Can't search</string> <string name="NO_PARKING_LOTS_FOUND">Can't find any parking lots or garages near there</string> <string name="PARKING_NEARBY_DESTINATION">near %1$s</string> Based on the wording, I assume the parking location will be placed immediately before the destination instead of replacing it, which makes sense if you need walking directions after parking the car. On the subject of walking, search results will be presented with an estimate of how long it will take to walk from a parking area to the final destination. <string name="SEE_MORE_PARKING_OPTIONS">See more options</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_GREATER_THAN_ONE">+%1$s walk</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_LESS_THAN_ONE"><1 min walk</string> There seems to be one catch: The parking recommendations seem to be incompatible with routes involving multiple stops. I doubt there's a technical reason these two features can't coexist, so it's probably a decision to avoid building an overcomplicated interface. <string name="PARKING_NOT_SUPPORTED_MESSAGE">Parking was removed because it's not supported for multiple stops</string> Overall, I think this is going to be a great addition and will save a lot of people from the pattern of first driving to a place and then driving in circles for another 15-20 minutes desperately searching for parking. Traffic Histogram For many years, Google has been able to tell us with bewildering accuracy just how long a drive should take. This isn't just a matter of calculating distance and speed limits, but also making estimates based on established traffic patterns. While it's nice to get an idea of the total time, some drivers certainly want to know if part of their trip is going involve slowly creeping through nearly standstill traffic. Google is working to put that information in front of users with a chart of anticipated traffic density throughout a drive. The string below spells out the concept pretty clearly. <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_TRAFFIC_TREND_BAR_CHART">A time-series histogram showing how much traffic is on your route today.</string> There's next to zero information beyond the string below, but I would expect the histogram to look like the busyness chart introduced late last year, but with shorter time increments – maybe every 10 or 15 minutes. Most people will probably see this as a "nice to know" type of feature, but it could be a life saver for drivers that get panicky in heavy traffic, or at least a useful tool for road trippers. I know I'd like to get a good look at traffic in a few spots before driving down to the Bay Area next month.

And be warned: Your productivity may be about to take a tumble. Assuming you don't mind descending down a rabbit hole, you may want to check out Voyager — a "showcase of interactive tours" meant to enhance the latest version of Google Earth. Voyager, which was introduced Tuesday, allows Earth's bored employees to feed their wanderlust and pretend they are somewhere — anywhere — other than the office cubicle they are actually sitting in. Say you've never been to Paris. Voyager pairs the view provided by its maps with a still image and a so-called knowledge card to let users hop around the city as though they were on a packed three-day vacation. Similar tours of "Hemingway's Hangouts," Frank Gehry buildings and museums around the world are also available. Want a less urban experience? Jane Goodall will take you on a tour of a Tanzanian park and tell you about her team's chimpanzee research. You can even explore Afghanistan with Zari, a six-year-old Muppet character who hails from the country. Zari loves to read and study — a fortunate trait because, as a knowledge card tells us, "Afghanistan is home to one of the largest populations of young people in the world, but their education system is struggling." Rebecca Moore, director of Google Earth, called stories and storytelling the "linchpin" of the new Google Earth and said that Voyager would allow more people to tell such stories in more timely and compelling ways. "What you're never going to find in Voyager is, 'Here's a tour of homes of celebrities,'" Moore said. "What we want to do is inspire people to explore the world through this interactive educational experience. We see it as a way to bridge cultures." For more than a decade, Google Earth has allowed users to see the places they plan to visit before they actually do — or to revisit places they once knew. But as Google Earth became more ubiquitous, people found other ways to leverage it. Virtual flights over land and sea with Google Earth, it turned out, were an excellent way to learn about places, Moore said. "In an ad hoc, kind of grassroots manner, people were using it to tell stories," she said. "What we realized is we wanted to take it to the next level." The latest update took two years to create, Gopal Shah, a Google Earth project manager, said in a blog post. Moore called it "our gift to the world," noting that the tool is "not commercialized" in any way. Melissa Parrish, a research director at Forrester, a technology and marketing research firm, said that Google sometimes does create projects "just because they can." But she said a company does not become as successful as the tech giant "without thinking about the monetization possibilities of everything they do." Google may choose not to place ads directly on Google Earth or Voyager, Parrish said, but she added that every time a user clicks around the world, Google could presumably gather data it can use to target consumers elsewhere on the web. "They're Google," Parrish said. "If there's one thing they're incredible at, it's making money." Voyager is among a number of new features within the revamped Google Earth. There are dozens of virtual trips currently available — including one through New York City — and Moore promised more to come.

Amazon’s Alexa sent her a playhouse. By Paul Gilster Correspondent LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story It’s going to take me awhile to get used to computers that never stop listening to what I do. The other morning I was happily driving along listening to a track from Miles Davis’ “Kind of Blue” album when I realized the clock in my car wasn’t set right. Just to see if it would work with my phone buried deep in my pocket, I called out the query “OK Google, what time is it?” Back came a muffled reply: “The time is 7:48 AM.” Our devices are starting to do this, listening rather than waiting for a button press or other hardware action. You already know that this runs beyond smartphones if you have an Amazon Echo or Google Home, which both allow you to run any number of actions by voice command alone. “Alexa, play Miles Davis” works any time I want to hear more of the master’s work, but that means Alexa always has her ear to the ground, waiting for the activating phrase. This can get weird, comic and even deeply irritating. Earlier this year, the Amazon Echo so enthralled a 6-year old child named Brooke Neitzel that she asked it to play dollhouse with her, and along the way, get her a new dollhouse. You can imagine what happened next, with the dollhouse arriving from Amazon along with, somehow, four pounds of sugar cookies. A CBS affiliate in Dallas reported that after Alexa confirmed her order, Brooke burst into a spontaneous “I love you so much!” – a fact confirmed by the app itself, the tracing of its actions being a sudden priority for her parents. Soon they had installed a code to prevent unauthorized purchases, something that is easy to do if you know you need to do it in the first place. Google clearly wants to avoid the problem. It’s introducing multi-user support for Google Home, which means that the smart home device will be able to figure out who is talking to it. Soon, concerned parents will be able to establish guidelines for family members based upon voice alone, with some privileges being granted to the adults, others to the kids. Need to know what’s on your calendar? When this is implemented, Google Home can give you your appointments but dole out an entirely different set to your spouse, a personalization feature that will give Google Home a step up over the Amazon alternative. I would have to assume that Amazon will get a similar feature working in short order. You can see where this is going. Google lives by ads – in fact, its AdSense division alone made a cool $22 billion in the last quarter of 2016. Personalizing its user base means more opportunity to fine-tune ads based upon individual preferences. The idea also works toward making the smart home device concept more palatable to people who may be skeptical. The more useful a device is in a highly targeted way, the less likely it is to seem frivolous. Along the way, what a set of bumps, though. Thus Burger King had the bright idea to run a television ad in which the burger-wielding protagonist leaned into the camera and said “OK Google, what is a Whopper burger?” Boom – Google Homes across the land, hearing the request, read out the first line of the Wikipedia entry on the Whopper, which had evidently been edited for maximum effect. Guess what happened? Other people starting editing the Whopper entry – you can do this on Wikipedia – and some of the changes were less than kind toward Burger King. Google quickly stopped Home from responding to the Whopper challenge, and the Wikipedia page became locked. Who knows what’s next? Back to the dollhouse story. In San Diego, a TV story about it triggered some viewers’ Echo devices to place orders for more dollhouses. The moral of the tale: Study the settings on your home device and learn how to tweak them before sugar cookies show up at your door. PS: Amazon says that accidental orders can be returned for free. But fix your settings anyway. Paul A. Gilster is the author of several books on technology. Reach him at pag1877@gmail.com.

The 29-year-old actor once entered her name into a search engine and it “ended in full depression,” she says in a recent video for Variety magazine. “It’s a good rule of thumb not to Google yourself because the Internet is not nice.” Lively’s reaction may be severe, but she’s hardly the first person to be upset by a series of negative Google hits. Beverly Hills psychotherapist Fran Walfish has seen couples that squabble over finding a photograph of their partner at a strip club to young adults emotionally scarred from images of their chubby childhood uploaded by their relatives. There’s also the risk of a prospective employer coming across something negative and untrue. “People come to me in deep trouble from things they’ve found,” says the author of “The Self-Aware Parent.” “There’s a ton out there that can be toxic.” The European Court of Justice has ruled that there’s a controversial “right to be forgotten” on that continent, but it’s difficult to scrub your digital existence. “There are ways if content violates a web host’s policy, but it’s not often successful,” says Joseph Torrillo, vice president at Reputation Management. “It’s a very labor intensive and drawn-out process.” There are however, smarter methods if you can live with having some negative stuff out there. “If you can’t get rid, dilute,” says Don Sorensen, a reputation manager at Big Blue Robot. Contrary to what some think, not having an active web presence of your own is not savvy. “When Google can’t find anything, bad news is all it’s going to show,” he says. The first thing you should do is buy your domain name and set up biographical pages on platforms like About.me, which Google’s search algorithm regards pretty well. This means you control what your name is associated with. There are also ways to convince the search giant to move the pages you’d like others to find higher up. Sorensen carried out an experiment with the goal of moving an article he wrote to the first page of that search engine by linking to it on his LinkedIn profile and regularly tweeting the URL. It took about three months for Google to promote the piece. Photos are a little trickier. As opposed to the one headshot that people often share across Twitter, and LinkedIn, have a variety out there. Post them on sites like Flickr and Google Photos, and make sure they’re tagged with your name, says Sorensen. If you’re upset but can’t be bothered to go through the hassle of playing Google at its game, teach yourself to live with it. For some people “reading something about themselves is an invitation to pick up a judge’s hammer and pound themselves,” says Walfish, the psychotherapist. “They need to develop a stronger barrier to shut out negative influences so it doesn’t impact one’s core ego.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under digital privacy ,  google ,  internet ,  privacy Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next This brand lets you exchange clothes you diet your way out...

The video-streaming website placed that has a benchmark for anyone that wanted to stream via mobile when it first launched the service last February. The change was quietly made early this month with a lot of tech blogs missing out on the update. According to TechCrunch, the update was added to the support page of YouTube around early April where the tech giant confirmed the latest change. Perhaps, Google should have removed every hurdle and allow every creator access to the service. The truth is that, not everyone has the experience or required skill to create lively or entertaining content. It’s best not to make such a service an open one if creators don’t have the ability to produce quality and entertaining content. Surely, any creator that has a minimum of 1,000 subscribers can be regarded as experienced enough to create quality content regularly. Established channels [creators with the minimum subscribers as specified by Google] have the capacity to maintain high standard, and not stream illegal content. Reputation is always a priority for such established creators. YouTube mobile live streaming has been configured into the mobile app. All you have to do [if you have 1,000 subscribers] to start streaming is to open the app, tap the capture button, and you are live. Streamed videos, according to YouTube, will not be different from your regular YouTube videos in terms of quality. Your subscribers will be able to search for them, recommend them, and protected from unauthorized viewing or use. To improve streaming quality and ensure everything works out just fine, YouTube has slowed down live chats. This measure will ensure the streaming quality across all devices is high. Supper Chat—a new way to make money if you are a creator was also launched alongside mobile streaming last February. Super Chat is an enhanced messaging service that enables you to earn money while livestreaming. With Super Chat, followers will be able to pay to highlight a message they post to the chat window while a live broadcast is on. Paying for such chats will enable the message be pinned on the window for up to five hours. Anyone pinning a message will be allowed to enter the amount they would like to pin on their message. On Super Chat, you will see a dollar bill symbol in a chat window when you watch a live stream. Click on that button to open a slider that allows you to set an amount that you want to send to the YouTuber. The length of your comment will be determined by how much you have paid—and the higher the amount, the longer your comment will last on the window. Do you have up to 1,000 subscribers?

Windows 10 Is Watching: Should You Be Worried? Since its release, Windows 10 has been dogged by rumors concerning user privacy. Some of these are accurate, whereas others are myths. But where does Windows 10 stand on privacy, really? Read More : privacy. Windows 10 included mandatory and opt-out data collection for “product improvement and personalization” purposes. They further complicated the situation by being unclear about what data they were collecting and for what purpose, leading to claims that Windows 10 was a “privacy nightmare”. With the advent of the Windows 10 Creator’s Update though, Microsoft seems to have decided that the time is right to be more transparent about their data gathering activities. What Privacy Concerns? Gathering data through Windows is nothing new. In fact it has been happening in Windows since 2009 Is Microsoft Gathering Data From You in Windows 7 and 8?

Read More through the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). The biggest difference though between Windows 10 Telemetry and the CEIP is that the data gathering is no longer opt-in. Once you were upgraded to Windows 10, Microsoft began gathering data on your use of your Windows computer and even linked that data to your Microsoft account. Although the use of an opt-out approach is generally frowned upon, Microsoft took it a step further by complicating the privacy options, and giving you little choice in the matter. If these privacy changes had happened pre-2013, then there’s a good chance that they may have been overlooked. However, in that year Edward Snowden leaked documents from the NSA that laid bare the mass surveillance of U.S. citizens and internet users around the world.

In fact some Microsoft software that people believed to be secure like Skype, Hotmail, and even Word, were susceptible to surveillance. The timing of the addition of mandatory data gathering, with little explanation, and only two years after the initial revelations was particularly problematic. This led many to aggressively question Microsoft’s data gathering, even going so far as to develop tools to disable Windows telemetry, or to suggest abandoning Windows all together for a more secure Linux-based OS. Unfortunately Microsoft decided to stay silent on the matter which only made the fears appear more rational. The third-party tools that were designed to disable the data collection 7 Tools to Manage Privacy Settings in Windows 7 Tools to Manage Privacy Settings in Windows Every Windows version has its flaws and user privacy is one that haunts them all.

Services like Windows Update and malware protection rely on connecting to Microsoft servers. With all connections blocked, users became unable to patch critical security holes. Fortunately, Microsoft has decided to remedy this potentially dangerous situation by finally granting Windows users clear and granular privacy settings in the Windows 10 Creator’s Update. To coincide with the update’s release, they also published an in-depth guide to the different areas of data collection on TechNet. Defined Categories In the Creator’s Update there has also been a simplification of data collection levels down to either Basic or Full. A companion TechNet post listed every point of data collected at the Basic level along with Technical Information. In the TechNet post Microsoft broke down the Full level data collection into nine distinct categories: Common Data Device, Connectivity, and Configuration data Product and Service Usage data Product and Service Performance data Software Setup and Inventory data Content Consumption data Browsing, Search and Query data Inking, Typing, and Speech Utterance data Licensing and Purchase data Microsoft has so far only published descriptions and example data for each category at the Full collection level. Common Data For diagnostic events at either Basic or Full level, Microsoft collects a header of what they term “common data” which includes: OS Version Device Type (Mobile, Desktop, Server) User ID (Not recorded at Basic collection) Diagnostic Level (Basic or Full) Device ID Browsing, Search, and Query Data Given the uproar after Congress voted to allow ISPs to sell your internet history FOR SALE: Your Browsing History -- So What Can You Do? FOR SALE: Your Browsing History -- So What Can You Do? An FCC ruling that the ISPs must obtain permission from customers before selling personal data could be reversed. Your ISP is about to set a price for your personal data. How can we fight back? Read More , it’s clear that people believe their browsing and search data to be very personal. This makes the Browsing, Search and Query data type particularly contentious. Microsoft browser data — Text typed into the address bar, text selected for Cortana search, autocomplete, URLs, and page titles. On-device file query — Search type, number of items found, file extension of item opened, App ID of opening app, search scope. When searching locally on your device only metadata about the search is collected, presumably in order to make sure that search helps you find what you are looking for more efficiently. The good news about the browsing and online search history is that if you don’t want to be involved, you can just use another browser as it applies only to either internet Explorer or Edge. Its worth keeping in mind that Microsoft only tracks searches on their browsers, and also allows you to opt-out. This is in stark contrast to Google who monitor all searches on their platform in order to provide you ads How to Disable Google's Personalized Ads How to Disable Google's Personalized Ads It's no secret that Google presents personalized ads to you based on your browsing history. If that creeps you out, then here's how to disable it once and for all. Read More . Inking, Typing, and Speech Utterance With the rise of smart home devices along with the high-profile legal case involving Amazon’s Echo device Shopping vs. Privacy: What Does Amazon Know About You? Shopping vs. Privacy: What Does Amazon Know About You? Did you think Amazon was too noble to breach your privacy? You'd be surprised. Here's what the company knows about you, where that knowledge comes from, and how you can control it. Read More in 2016, people have become very aware of the potential for their devices to be always listening to them. The Inking, Typing, and Speech Utterance category aims to clarify exactly what Microsoft does with the data it processes. Type of pen used (highlighter, ballpoint, pencil), color, stroke, height, width, and how long it is used. Text of speech recognition results. Ink strokes written, text before and after ink insertion, recognized text. Whether the user is known to be a child. Confidence and Success/Failure of speech recognition. The post makes it clear that any ink strokes that are converted to text are stripped of information that could reconstruct the content or associate it to a user. If collection of voice data outlined here seems oddly brief, that would be because the main voice input — Cortana — is governed by a separate data collection policy. Content Consumption Data After the Windows 10 launch, Microsoft appeared to stay purposefully silent on the matter of data collection. Then they entered the foray by publishing some interesting usage statistics over on their blog. Among all the data included was that there had been “over 82 billion photos viewed within the Windows 10 Photo app”. This did little to calm people’s worries. In an effort to rectify this, the Content Consumption data type is explicit that it “includes diagnostic details about Microsoft applications that provide media consumption functionality (such as Groove Music), and is not intended to capture user viewing, listening or reading habits.” There are four categories of Content Consumption: Movies — Video width, height, and color palette. Encoding type and streaming instructions. Music & TV — URL of songs being downloaded, media type, and local media library statistics. Reading — Name of the app accessing Windows Store books, book language, and time spent reading. Photos App — File source (SD card, network device, OneDrive), image/video size and resolution, and media view (full screen or collection view). Under the Content Consumption data type Microsoft isn’t tracking what you consume but rather how you consume it. And the Rest In addition to the more controversial categories of data collection, Microsoft also provided information on some of the less disputed categories. Device, Connectivity, and Configuration Data As the name suggests, this data type is all about the type of device you are using, how it connects to the internet, and how it is configured. The TechNet post gives a comprehensive list of the data collected, but the highlights are: Device properties — Operating system, OEM name, serial numbers & hardware configurations Device capabilities — Touchscreen support, cameras, wireless capabilities, voice input devices Among Device Preferences and settings, you’ll find references to user settings, encryption status, default app choices, language preferences, Windows Update settings Network information — Network type, access point manufacturer, model, and MAC address, paid or free network Device peripherals Although this list seems particularly long and potential invasive, it’s not all that different to data that can be gathered by specification tools Did You Get The PC You Ordered?

Read More  to the websites you visit. Product and Service Usage Data The original purpose behind the CEIP was to “[help] Microsoft identify which Windows features to improve“. By tracking which features users spent most of their time with, or even which had the most problems, Microsoft was able to focus their efforts in useful ways. The Product and Service Usage category is an extension of that purpose. Product and Service Performance Data This category primarily covers information used for diagnostics and device health. When an app crashes or something unexpected happens, this is the data that may help get to the bottom of it. Device Health and Crash data — Error codes/messages, system generated log files, user generated files indicated as potential cause of crash, crash and hang dumps. Device Performance and reliability data There is a lot of data nested underneath Device performance and reliability which may make you feel uneasy. However, a closer look shows that very little being recorded is sensitive or personal information. Instead, it is nearly all related to the health of the hardware and software configuration of your device. Software Setup and Inventory Data While updating to Windows 10, some users noticed that Microsoft was removing apps that weren’t installed through the Windows Store. This led to several Reddit threads where the mood was best summed up by u/pcg79: Comment from discussion pcg79’s comment from discussion "After upgrading to 10586, this notice was concerning. App wasn’t installed through the App Store, yet Windows removed it without prompting me.". For the last few iterations of Windows, Microsoft would check your upgrade eligibility and would warn you of any potential issues before you went ahead. Instead, Windows 10 was making the decision for you to remove the potentially problematic apps. This fueled speculation that Microsoft was collecting data on which applications were installed on your computer. In the future, could Microsoft remove apps they don’t approve of? Installed Applications and Install History — App (driver, update package, name, ID), Product, install date, method, install directory, MSI package and product codes. Installation type — Clean install, repair, restore, OEM, upgrade, update. Device update information — Information about Windows Update including machine ID, number of applicable updates, update download and size. Although the TechNet post does little to assuage those fears, Microsoft has at least admitted that they are tracking which applications you have installed on your computer. Licensing and Purchase Data In a world of online shopping and app stores, you perhaps already suspected that this information was being stored and collected. The data collected for Licensing and Purchasing allows Microsoft to verify that you are running a legitimate copy of Windows, as well as providing you with account information. Purchase History — Product name, price, time of purchase, and payment method. Entitlements — Subscriptions, license types and details, and DRM details. What Can You Do? The publication of Microsoft’s data collection categories was timed to coincide with the release of the Windows 10 Creator’s Update. As explained in a blog post by the Windows and Devices Group EVP Terry Myerson and Privacy Officer Marisa Rogers, the update give you more control over your privacy. As outlined in the post, Microsoft has improved the information you see about the privacy settings throughout Windows, by including descriptions and “Learn More” buttons. The major improvement to the Windows 10 privacy settings though is during the Creator’s Update installation process. As part of the update process, you will now be able to review your privacy settings, even if you were already running Windows 10. As well as being able to choose between Basic and Full levels of data collection Microsoft Eases Your Windows 10 Privacy Concerns Microsoft Eases Your Windows 10 Privacy Concerns Ahead of the release of the Creators Update, Microsoft is addressing people's privacy concerns regarding Windows 10. But will this be enough to appease privacy advocates? Read More , you will also be able to fine-tune other privacy settings including location access, and personalized ads. While the majority of the data outlined in the TechNet post is specific to the device you are using, there are areas that overlap with your Microsoft account. This includes the use of Cortana as the personal assistant will store your preferences and interests. Microsoft recently launched a web-based privacy dashboard that allows you to view and remove data that has been collected and associated with your Microsoft account. Are You Ready to Trust Microsoft Again? With credit to Microsoft, they have listened to their users and made a concerted effort to be more transparent about data collection. They have provided more controls and options as to what data is stored and how it is used. This may have reassured you that Microsoft — despite their ties to the PRISM program — isn’t overreaching in their data collection. However, it’s important to note that all the new privacy features are only available and relevant to Windows 10 Creator’s Update. Windows 7, 8, and “vanilla” 10 will not be receiving the same treatment or level of transparency. If you find yourself still struggling to accept Microsoft’s data collection tactics then there are many ways to protect yourself.

Roston - Apr 21, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It’s the Samsung Galaxy S8‘s big day, and that means there are deals for the taking. If you haven’t already preordered the phone, now is your chance to jump on one of several promotions being offered by a handful of carriers, including things like a free handset, a buy-one-get-one deal, and/or low down payments. Most of these deals are limited-time offers and, in some cases, they require you to port a number over. Ready to take the plunge? Read on to find the best deal for you! Verizon — $15/month with trade-in + gift card First up is Big Red, the nation’s biggest carrier. Verizon has rolled out the red carpet for Samsung’s newest flagship offering, and it has some deals to go along with it. Those who pick up a Galaxy S8 or a Galaxy S8+ through Verizon have the chance to get discounted $15/month payments by either trading in an applicable older phone or porting over a new number and signing up for Verizon Unlimited. As well, Verizon will toss in a $50 Visa gift card. To get a $15/month rate for the Galaxy S8, which works out to up to $396 USD in savings, you’ll need to trade in one of the following smartphones: iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus iPhone 6s iPhone 6s Plus iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus Samsung Galaxy S6 Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Samsung Galaxy Note5 LG G5 LG V20 HTC 10 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Moto Z Droid Moto Z Droid Force If you’re hoping to get that rate for the Galaxy S8+, your trade-in options are more limited: Google Pixel XL, Moto Z Force, iPhone 7 Plus, or Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. Verizon is also offering a $20/month pricing rate for certain trade-ins, which again depend on whether you want the Galaxy S8 or the S8+. Those who want the smaller of the two handsets can get this rate by trading in any of the following: iPhone SE, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy S5, LG V10, HTC M9, or Droid Turbo 2. Those who want the $20/month rate for the S8+ will need to trade in any of the following phones: iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus iPhone 6s iPhone 6s Plus iPhone 7 Samsung Galaxy S6 Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy Note5 LG G5 LG V20 HTC 10 Google Pixel Moto Z Droid Finally, Verizon is offering a $25/month rate for the Galaxy S8+ to customers who trade in one of the following phones: iPhone SE, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy S5, LG V10, HTC M9, or Droid Turbo 2. Of course, there are some finer details to be aware of. This trade-in promotion is applied as a credit over the course of 24 months, and an initial port-in and $840 device payment is required. The promotional credit starts within one or two billing cycles. As well, the phones that are traded in have to be in good condition and functional, and they have to be paid off in full. Sprint — Two-for-one phone leasing Sprint, the carrier that poached Verizon’s iconic spokesperson and brags about having an almost-as-good network, is likewise offering a Galaxy S8 deal. This promotion seems ideal for couples, families, or friends who want the latest flagship but aren’t interested in long-term ownership: two Galaxy S8s for the cost of one as a lease, meaning you won’t actually own the phone at the end of the term. The carrier says the lease is available only for ‘well-qualified’ buyers and it comes with an 18-month term, as well as a $31.25/month cost. The deal also requires the customer(s) to activate two new lines or to upgrade one and activate a new second one. As well, the promotional pricing is applied as a credit which will show up within two billing invoices. Sprint goes on to say that its customers have the option of upgrading to a newer Galaxy phone after 12 lease payments have been made, meaning the upgrade can happen any time after the first year but before the 18-month lease term ends. AT&T — Buy one and get one free AT&T, of course, is also hawking its own promotion. In this case, the carrier will give its customers a free Galaxy S8 when they purchase one…but with a couple conditions. The first requirement is that you must buy both with AT&T Next and have each phone on applicable plans: a minimum of $50/month for the first line and minimum of $20/month for the second line. You’ll also need to have a DirecTV subscription priced at a minimum of $29.99/month. As well, the terms and conditions note that the customer will have to pay for both phones initially, and will eventually get the second phone free via bill credits that are parsed out over the course of 30 months; the credits begin appearing two-to-three months after billing starts. As well, a new line of service is required, and the customer has to stay with the carrier for the full term, otherwise the $850 full balance will have to be paid. T-Mobile — $30 down and $30/month The Uncarrier’s launch-day deals aren’t as impressive because T-Mobile began taking preorders for the Galaxy S8 phones days ago…in fact, some of its customers should have already received their phones thanks to early shipments. If you’re looking to join T-Mobile’s service and haven’t ordered the phone yet, the carrier does have some perks: a $30 down payment followed by $30/month payments, but only if you have good credit. If you do go with this deal, you’ll have to stay with the carrier through the entire 24-month payment term, as well, otherwise T-Mobile will require the full device payment. Customers will less than stellar credit have less options: a $582 USD downpayment followed by a $7/month device fee for 24 months. U.S. Cellular — Free with bill credit and contract Finally, we have U.S. Cellular, which is also offering the Galaxy S8 today alongside a special promotion. This carrier is offering a ‘free’ Galaxy S8 to those who turn in a qualifying phone, which is any of the following: iPhone 5s iPhone SE iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus iPhone 6s iPhone 6s Plus iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus Galaxy S6 Galaxy S6 edge Galaxy S6 edge Plus Galaxy S6 Active Galaxy S7 Galaxy S7 edge Galaxy S7 Active Galaxy Note 5 Galaxy Note edge As well, U.S. Cellular says the deal requires customers to sign up for a 30-month installment contract, to port over a number, to have suitable credit, and to pay a possible $25 activation fee, among other possible fees (taxes, etc). On top of this, the customer also needs to sign up for Device Protection+ or pay an extra $8.99/month for each phone. The handset’s full price through the carrier is $726 USD, while the monthly payment is $24.20/month. That fee is cancelled out via a bill credit that starts within three billing invoices. Wrap-up If you’re not beholden to a particular carrier but you’re keen to get a Galaxy S8 or S8+, there are several ongoing deal options at the moment, some that are hinged on good credit and others that aren’t. Some deals provide discounts immediately, while others come in the form of bill credits; regardless, the big carriers are offering something for (just about) everyone.

The report, it turns out, is partially true. Google is thinking about making the ad-blocker – and has discussed the idea with others in the advertising industry — but the end-product might not be as threatening as it first sounded. Google has talked with the Coalition for Better Ads — an ad industry trade group — regarding an ad blocking feature on its Chrome browser, several sources told CNBC. Theoretically, it would work similarly to Chrome's update in 2015 that blocked all ads that used Adobe Flash technology, and would not discriminate if the ad was placed by Google's ad exchanges or another competing service, a source said. But if it becomes a reality, the end product would likely be very friendly towards advertisers and media companies, and adhere to industry standards that are currently being hashed out, said Coalition for Better Ads' counsel Stu Ingis. Those standards are likely to be determined in the next six months to a year, Ingis said. Ingis said calling the proposed product an "ad blocker" isn't strictly accurate. "To me an 'ad blocker' is a company blocking ads and eliminating the consumer interest in experience without any dialogue with these [advertising and publisher] companies," said Ingis. "I would view anything that is adopting this type of standard process set forth by the industry based on the consumer research as not an 'ad blocker.'" If Google does decide to make the Chrome feature, the goal would be to provide users with choice and options about their online experience, a Google spokesperson said. Google agreed that it would also be in line with guidelines set by the advertising industry. "We've said publicly for awhile now that Google alone cannot solve the bad experiences users have online — we need a data-driven industry approach to improving ads experiences," a Google spokesperson said. "As a member of the [Coalition], we've been talking to a number industry associations, publishers, advertisers and other technology companies about the development of the Better Ads Standard. One option we're exploring is how Chrome could help support this Standard. We can't confirm any additional details or timing right now." The Coalition is creating guidelines to improve the online ad experience with input from its members, which include Facebook, News Corp., Procter & Gamble and Unilever, as well as agencies like Group M and Omnicom. The organization is also including information from its 25,000-person survey on what they disliked about online advertising. Google has been a "very collaborative participant," Ingis added. But the ad industry's worries aren't completely soothed, and agencies say there are still unanswered questions. IPG Mediabrands senior vice president of ad operations Mitch Weinstein pointed out several potential conflicts-of-interest. Would the service would only allow ads served (or placed on websites) through Google's owned-and-operated services? Would YouTube ads would be blocked if watched through a Chrome browser? "[There's] a lot of questions on this, but it could potentially be a very big deal," he said. Google has no plans to exempt itself, a source with knowledge of project said. Slow-loading websites, inaccessible content, and cluttered webpages have made many people hate online advertising, Weinstein said. At the same time, ads are a necessary part of the ecosystem because it's a major source of revenue for online publishers. IPG Mediabrands is also working with several organizations to make sure its ads are "lighter and less intrusive," to keep customers happy. Advertisers are always concerned when they hear the words "ad blocker," said BBH communications planner Zach Green. But if Google creates its own with everyone's input, it could be an big win for them. The company could develop its own ad format that wouldn't be blocked, Green pointed out. It would also force the entire industry to think more "creatively" to find ways to weave ads into content, he added. "Google is giving people what they want, but it's also may be a place for Google to come up with their own bespoke in-line ad opportunities," he said.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware.

Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version.

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

These constant shifts have challenged the hospitality industry to keep pace with new technology and trends so as to compete in the online community space. NB: This is an analysis by Jean-Luis Boss, chief marketing and digital services officer at Fastbooking. Optimising a hotel’s online distribution to drive more direct traffic requires digital marketing strategy and tools to be efficient and effective in their efforts within the online community. In 2015, just two years ago, organic traffic accounted for 62% of the traffic in a hotel website. This figure has reduced to 42% in 2017. Undoubtedly, this is still an important source of traffic for hoteliers to leverage on. The apparent reason being is that organic traffic to a hotel’s website is nearly free. However, this is not sufficient to drive more traffic and conversion to a hotel’s website. To compete effectively in the digital community space, an effective digital marketing strategy to drive more qualified traffic and conversion to the hotel’s website is pertinent. This plan, as we all know, encompasses search engine marketing (SEM), pre-and retargeting display ads campaigns, AdWords and the ultimate driver, metasearch. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, Metasearch has grown to become the most important advertising channel for hotels outpacing even AdWords, according to own data. And this trend is escalating. The evolution of metasearch in 2017 We have been managing metasearch campaigns for hotels for more than seven years. From the launch of metasearch, our hotel booking platforms were connected to the leading hotel metasearch channels to advertise direct hotel rates. During this period, we have seen ample growth for this digital channel, and we have learnt the strategy of optimising the various metasearch channels to generate maximum revenue for hotels with the best possible return on ad spend. We found it important to help hotels understand the various digital channels and how they work so that they can make better choices and decisions on advertising budgets. 1. TripAdvisor Over the last five years, TripAdvisor has held the dominant position in metasearch advertising, especially in areas of quality of traffic and revenue generated. The illustration below provides the year-on-year progress on revenue generation and traffic cost versus the return on ad spend. Although TripAdvisor remains as one of the key channels on the market and is still one of the best performing platforms for metasearch, its numbers have recently declined both in traffic volume and return on investment. Brief history: In 2012: The volume of clicks was much higher because TripAdvisor still had its infamous pop-under system (opens a separate page on the website). Anyone searching for information on a hotel would receive six or more offers at the same time. In 2013: TripAdvisor system changed to display dynamic rates, causing traffic to decrease while the cost per click increased. In 2014: The cost per click peaked to 400% from 2012, and the return on the ad spend declined. However, the conversion rate was much higher with much more qualified traffic. In 2015: The prices evened out and a steady reduction in the cost per click. Return on ad spend reverted to the 2012 level which was consistent around 10X the previous levels. Our analysis TripAdvisor produces highly qualified traffic with good conversion rates and has a very international audience even though it is strongest in North America. For hotels in Europe and Asia, this translates into a high return on investment as the average stay is longer than domestic or regional audiences. From our analysis, users who book through TripAdvisor has an average stay of 4.5 days. The bidding system has improved over the years but remains quite opaque. The priority is given to the highest bidder, and as an advertiser, you will not know how much that bid is. One can opt for a “share of clicks,” which somewhat guarantees that one will be visible and receive clicks a certain percentage of the time. Changes in bidding and campaigns can be managed on a daily basis. Our tip Do not systematically bid for the first position as the cost can rapidly raise and returns will lower. Instead, use TripAdvisor’s reporting to stay within the top 3. Additionally, if one’s ADR is low, opt for the “Instant Booking” model to keep costs low. 2. Google Hotel Ads Google launched Hotel Ads as Hotel Finder in 2011. Since then the product has changed names to Google Hotel Price Ads and now to Google Hotel Ads. The product and performance have grown exponentially every year both in terms of click volume and return on ad spend. Following a slightly different business model than other metasearch products, Google launched with a pay-per-click model that was based on the total cost of the potential reservation. They retained this model but added a performance model which is a percentage of the actual booking fee. Based on click volume, Google’s Hotel Ads matured in 2016, and today the click volume equal or surpasses TripAdvisor while keeping a very profitable Return on ad spend. As Google is integrating the ads deeper into its search results, maps, and other products, it is poised to become one of the leading hotel metasearch providers in the market. Our analysis Google Hotel Ads currently has the most qualified traffic of all metasearch providers. Traffic volume is now at a level that makes it a compelling investment for hotels and hotel groups of all sizes. However, it is quite complicated to manage the bidding system that offers extremely granular possibilities. This is too complex to manage unless one has a full-time e-commerce or advertising manager. Google Hotel Ads has stopped developing direct connectivity with hotels and is always connected through a third party. With Google’s experience and expertise in AdWords, they have developed a management system to optimise bidding and precise geo-targeting. The bids are managed every few minutes if not instantly, making it a reliable metasearch platform for budget control and adjustments. The system is very open and offers full transparency on performance, competitiveness and opportunities. Our tip To be effective when advertising on Google Hotel Ads, we recommend for budget hotels to switch to the performance model and for Deluxe and luxury hotels with a higher ADR to use the cost per click model. Hotels must ensure that these multiple campaigns are constantly monitored and managed. 3. Trivago Trivago has always been one of the main click volume producers on the metasearch market. The cost per click is the lowest of all the metasearch providers, yet the ROI has not been as good as TripAdvisor or Google Hotel Ads, although it is increasing. The steady growth of the platform since the part equity acquisition by Expedia in 2013 and the subsequent large investment in brand visibility through TV ads make this platform a very attractive option for hotels that require a boost in brand awareness. Our analysis From a budget management perspective, this is a platform that requires careful observation and management. We have seen massive traffic increases each time TV ad campaigns are launched. However, the conversion rate is relatively low. To ensure that budgets are not depleted, we recommend hotels to make sure that their budgets and bids are properly managed for maximum returns. Small changes in bids (such as a single cent increase) can have a significant impact on impression share and can result in budget over-spend. There is no built-in budget capping, though some third parties have created their own. The platform is improving quite frequently, including in its management possibilities. Trivago can be used successfully for international traffic, but it is most efficient with inbound travellers from Europe. Finally, the business model is the cost per click only. As many of the hotels used for this analysis were located in Europe, the average length of stay was shorter than TripAdvisor (2 nights versus 4.5). The ranking system is prioritised by the best rate first and the bid second, if there is full rate parity the bid obviously takes priority. Our tip As Trivago’s ranking model prioritises rates if one can have a slightly lower rate on their website one will get more clicks at a lower cost. 4. HotelsCombined HotelsCombined is one of the most important metasearch partners for our hotels in this area. One of the first companies in the hotel metasearch market, HotelsCombined delivers an excellent return on investment for hotels targeting travellers going to Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand demographics. Our analysis Although the click volumes are lower than TripAdvisor, Trivago, and Google Hotel Ads, the demographics served by HotelsCombined are a valuable addition to hotels seeking travellers from Asia Pacific region. Click volumes are stable, and the business model only costs per acquisition with very little control over visibility. However, it is a must if one wants to add traffic from those regions. 5. Google AdWords We have included Google AdWords, even though it is NOT a metasearch channel, as a comparison between advertising costs and returned on investment for hotel marketers. AdWords are still one of the most cost-efficient advertising channels for hotels both in terms of return on ad spend and click volumes. AdWords have consistently had the highest return on investment, and even though metasearch has recently overtaken AdWords as an advertising channel, in terms of revenue generated, it remains a vital channel for hotel marketers. The efficiency of AdWords is extremely high when using it to protect one’s hotel brand name from OTAs or other third parties trying to advertise on one’s name. Our tip Be careful when targeting broad or generic keywords such as “Hotels in [city]” as these keywords are very expensive and have a low return on ad spend for individual hotels. Focus instead on a mix of 80% brand keywords and 20% broader keywords with extreme care on budget spend. 6. Display advertising We also included display advertising as we have noticed through our campaign management that this nicely complements metasearch advertising, both in brand awareness and conversions. Through running multiple campaigns using targeted display channels and retargeting, we have seen an average return on ad spend of 10.2X. This makes it a very profitable addition to the advertising mix. Our tip Individual results depend on the hotel’s location: High-interest destinations such as the main cities tend to have a better return since there is more traffic from the pre-targeting campaigns. The trick here is to ensure that there is enough display volume to generate brand awareness without over-saturating the ads to the travellers, and knowing when to turn the campaigns off so as not to display irrelevant advertising to the guest. Key takeaways and recommendations Metasearch can help you drive more traffic to your website: Metasearch is to become the most important advertising channel for hotels. Select the different digital players that are most pertinent to your business according to your sales area and your objectives: mass volume or high return on investment. The efficiency of your direct booking strategy depends on your price: We have noticed a substantial difference in return on ad spend for hotels that chose to give advantages to direct bookings. Lowering rates for direct bookings is one of the most efficient ways to make metasearch generate substantial direct revenue. We have noticed a return on ad spend by an average of 2.5X. As a general rule of thumb, if one is selling at higher rates on one’s website the results will not be profitable. At rate parity, the results are acceptable, although this lowers the direct booking percentage. Look for professionals: To secure a hotel’s direct bookings or simply to increase revenue across multiple sources, metasearch and digital advertising channels have become mandatory channels for both independent and chains hotels. We recommend hotel groups and chains to create an internal team for campaign management and optimisation. For independent hotels, it would be wise to use an experienced digital agency. Keep monitoring: Metasearch, like all online advertising platforms, is not set-it-and-forget-it platforms. It requires optimisation to ensure that the return-on-ad-spend is kept profitable. (One final) Food for thought The constant change in technology has kept hoteliers on their toes with constant adaptation. Different shifts in digital strategies to maximise direct traffic includes metasearch in the hotel distribution mix. We have witnessed that if digital marketing strategies are handled with experience, paid traffic can represent 30-50% of market share per hotel. This is definitely worth the effort and attention. Metasearch, notably Google Hotel Ads, are strong allies to Independent hotels. This would provide high visibility and conversion as compared to OTAs. Now the question that remains is “How to be connected to Metasearch?“ Hotel distribution is not going to get simpler; it will require a constant shift of strategies. Mobile, new technologies such as chatbots, etc. will continue to transform the digital landscape. But this also mean new opportunities and improved performance possibilities for hoteliers that embrace these new trends and technology.

The real number to think about for a hotelier is *incremental* ROAS. If a click comes from Tripadvisor, that is not necessarily incremental, since that customer probably would have booked even if they had not clicked on a hotel website link on Tripadvisor moment. Same goes for the other channels, but in every case the incrementality factor changes depending on the kind of searches happening on those channels. Tripadvisor gets hotel-specific searches. Same with Google HPA. Trivago and Kayak are dependent on what other bids are coming in, because they adjust overall rank based on bids. In most cases, when OTAs are competing for clicks, the incrementality factor is affected by the commission rates of the OTAs, because a nondirect click doesn’t mean a nonbooking, it just means a booking via an OTA.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article.

Clue: Google-powered Chromebooks in education. Windows 10 Cloud will be a cutdown version of Redmond's latest operating system, and is designed to be run on cheap kit. The new OS hasn't been launched yet but is expected to be revealed at a May 2 event in New York City. Redmond execs, perhaps alarmed at the rise and rise of Google's ChromeOS, have lined up an edition of Windows 10 that relies heavily on cloud services. Google's Chromium-based operating system is now the second most popular laptop operating system in the world, which will have grabbed Microsoft's attention. Google has made huge strides in this sector, just as it did with Android, but it has been particularly successful in the school sector. Alex Kuscher, senior product manager at Google, told The Reg that ChromeOS is the laptop OS for over half of US schoolchildren and sales in the sector are up 20 per cent year-on-year. Wonder who Microsoft sees as the competition ... A Windows 10 Cloud launch slide published by Windows Central As we've said the specs are baseline requirements, and there are some oddities. Take the battery life, for example. Microsoft claims Windows 10 Cloud systems can last 10 hours between charges, the same as a comparable Chromebook, but it will only last this long for "most students," not "all students" as with ChromeOS. Microsoft's system will also be slower to boot, slower to log into, and slower to reestablish credentials, according to the suggested timings. The base-level specs for a Microsoft Windows 10 Cloud laptop – revealed today by the Windows Central blog – will be as follows: Quad-core (Celeron or better) processor 4GB of RAM 32GB of storage (64GB for 64-bit) A battery larger than 40 WHr Fast eMMC or solid state drive (SSD) for storage technology Pen and touch (optional). One of the big selling points of Chromebooks is that they are cheap – typically around $200 – and Microsoft and its manufacturing partners are going to need to hit that price point to compete. It's unlikely Redmond is going to build much hardware itself at those sorts of prices. It's hardware division has, at times, produced some excellent, if expensive, bits of kit and is quite happy with the fat margins. No doubt Microsoft will be happy for factory lines like Samsung, Dell, and HP to run this razor-thin margin market. The Register will be attending the New York launch, and will bring you live coverage of the event. ® Tips and corrections 21 Comments MORE Microsoft Chromebooks More from The Register Chap 'fixes' Microsoft's Windows 7 and 8 update block on new CPUs Developer says he's found a way to stop Windows' new CPU check, which means updates flow again 102 Comments Microsoft promises twice-yearly Windows 10, O365 updates – with just 18 months' support Updated Sysadmin holidays cancelled in March and September, starting in 2020 86 Comments Microsoft ends OEM sales of Windows 7 Pro and Windows 8.1 When the nagware stops working, there's another way to get you upgrading 71 Comments Microsoft delivers secure China-only cut of Windows 10 There's Reds under the Windows!

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's the rebirth of satellite Internet iPhone 8 rumors: Apple might move Touch ID to the back of the device Video Is Snapchat building the iPhone killer? Apple has a new high-flying project in the works. According to Bloomberg, Apple is getting involved in launching satellites that would beam down broadband Internet access. Recently, Apple poached two Google satellite executives to form a new hardware team within the company. John Fenwick led Google’s spacecraft operations and Michael Trela was head of satellite engineering. The report adds that Fenwick and Trela will now report to Greg Duffy, the Dropcam founder who joined Apple earlier this year. Presumably, they will be working on a secret project to design and develop Apple’s own satellites.  Another recent development that points to Apple’s growing interest in this area is a partnership with Boeing to launch more than 1,000 low-orbit satellites. Apple has held discussions with Boeing about being an investor/partner in the project, according to Bloomberg. Furthermore, aerospace insiders believe Apple is helping fund the Boeing satellites. It’s not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation. “It’s not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation,” wrote Tim Farrar, a satellite consultant at TMF Associates. “SpaceX alone could generate $30 billion in revenue from satellite Internet by 2025.” Why this matters: A world with better access to faster, low-latency Internet will definitely help Apple’s future. It would help increase the demand for the iPhone in emerging markets, and also help make connected homes the next big thing. There are a few caveats, however. Satellite-beamed “Internet from the sky” has long been a dream for major tech companies, including Google and Facebook, which would also benefit from a more-connected world. But launching a fleet of satellites has proven to be expensive and risky, and many satellite companies have gone out of business as a result. It’s entirely possible that Apple hired the ex-Googlers to work on a project that’s more down to earth. Duffy’s experience is more in consumer products and image-capturing, so perhaps Apple’s new hardware team could be creating drones for improving Maps, and thus replacing the camera-equipped minivans.

Legitimate and accountable ad blocking can be a good and necessary solution. However, as we recently learned from Wall Street Journal, “Google plans to introduce an ad-blocking feature in the mobile and desktop versions of its popular Chrome browser.” ADVERTISEMENT The problems spotlighted in this piece are not with ad blocking, nor with Google participating in legitimate and accountable ad blocking. The problem is first with Google’s hypocrisy, and secondly with Google’s monopolistic behaviors involving Google Chrome, Search, Android, and advertising. Those issues raise legitimacy and accountability questions specific to Google’s ad blocking.   First, consider Google’s hypocrisy. The company supported net neutrality, or the idea that Internet service providers should be prohibited from blocking content on the Internet. Google is now seeking to engage in exactly that activity, which it had claimed was among the worst sins possible. Since 2006, Google has been a well-known corporate leader, funder, and vocal proponent of the net neutrality movement. The movement calls for the strongest possible utility regulation of ISPs and banning any potential ISP software from blocking or degrading the free flow of Web traffic. Proponents argue that ISPs are supposedly unique in being able to see all a user’s browser activity, and then purportedly being able to sell that data in the marketplace without a user’s permission. Google Chrome, on the other hand, is the world’s most popular browser, with a dominant 50 percent market share by most accounts. And Google encrypts traffic on its own global network of proxy servers via Chrome, making its browser activity invisible to any ISP, and anyone else on the web, including any third party that might try to ensure that any Google ad blocking is legitimate, accountable, and not anti-competitive. Net neutrality defenders, who understandably feel beholden to Google’s outsized financial and vocal support for net neutrality, are loathe to question that Google could be engaging in a non-neutral manner. Maybe they rationalize that since Google’s heart is in the right place and their words on net neutrality are the correct ones, they can trust that Google would never discriminate against another edge provider or garage start-up by blocking or throttling their free and open choice of ad model. They reason that Google would never be like a big, bad ISP. This brings us to the second problem that is particular to Google, when it comes to ad blocking without accountability and legitimacy measures that ensure, and independently confirm, Google is are not being anti-competitive. It should be of no surprise that upon hearing of Google’s ad-blocking plans, the European Union’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager warned on Twitter that she will closely scrutinize Google’s behavior for abuses of monopoly power. In a nutshell, what does Google’s ad blocking have to do with antitrust?  In the EU, Google faces three statements of objections (like a grand jury indictment) for illegally and anti-competitively self-dealing in Google Search, Android and search advertising. How did Google-Chrome so quickly become the world’s dominant share browser? It did so by contractually tying use of Android operating system and branding, to exclusive installation of several Google apps, including Chrome, which has resulted in at least one billion mobile Chrome users.   It is sad when the legitimate and urgent efforts of advertisers and the advertising industry to responsibly clean up the real and proliferating problem of too many consumer-unfriendly ad formats and automated bad actors on the Web must depend on a hypocritical monopolist as the primary implementer of a solution. It is more than ironic that Google has demonized ISPs for having the potential to block Internet traffic under the “principle” of net neutrality, and demonized copyright interests’ efforts to shut down notorious piracy websites as “censorship.” George Orwell’s famous allegory in Animal Farm concluded with the warning that “all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” That sums up this Google problem. Scott Cleland (@SCleland) served as deputy U.S. coordinator for International Communications & Information Policy in the George H. W. Bush Administration. He is president of Precursor LLC, an internetization consultancy for Fortune 500 companies, some of which are Google competitors. He is also the chairman of NetCompetition, a pro-competition e-forum supported by broadband interests. He is the author of “Search & Destroy: Why You Can’t Trust Google Inc.” Cleland has testified before both the Senate and House antitrust subcommittees on Google and before the relevant House oversight subcommittee on Google’s privacy problems.

Photographer: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images After seven months of work, the biggest digital advertising companies think they have a solution to the existential threat of consumers blocking online ads. Google, the biggest player in this world, is at the center of the plan, although the company and its partners are keen to present the initiative as a group effort. The Coalition for Better Ads published a list of undesirable online ads earlier this year. Google plans to add a feature to its Chrome web browser that would disable those ads. The feature is designed for publishers, rather than a tool for consumers, and would operate the same way Chrome already filters ads that are undesirable in other ways like those that drain computer batteries, according to people familiar with the plans. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Google's potential decision earlier this week, sparking criticism that the search ad giant was again exerting too much control over the market for digital ads. Now industry partners are stressing that the plan is a group effort and not finalized. They also distanced Google's tool from the existing ad blockers that prompted the initiative in the first place.  "There is no ad-blocker that's going into a browser," Randall Rothenberg, head of the Interactive Advertising Bureau trade group, said, although he wouldn't offer further details on the tool. "What we want is something that's industry-wide, that can demonstrably improve user experience and that's embraced by pretty much everyone."  Rothenberg helped set up the Coalition for Better Ads in September. Beyond Google, members include some of the largest marketers, ad agencies, media organizations and Facebook Inc. In March, the group issued its list of ad units -- including those that takeover entire screens or videos that start automatically -- that it claimed are most likely to prompt people to download ad blockers.  The Chrome option is different from current ad-blockers, which are downloaded as mobile apps or web browser plug-ins to zap most marketing messages, according to people familiar with the plans. Instead it may look like similar tools that Google builds into its browser. Last fall, Chrome began automatically disabling ads that use multimedia Flash players, citing computer battery drain. People in the Coalition said they expect Google will also hold its own search, display and YouTube ads to the same standards it imposes on the rest of the industry, although the terms have not been finalized. The people asked not to be identified discussing private matters. Alphabet Inc.'s Google declined to comment on potential Chrome features. However, the company emphasized that its plans are part of a group effort. "Google alone cannot solve for the incentives users have to install ad blockers," a company spokeswoman said. "We need an industry approach that is data-driven and endorsed by everyone."  Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Getting broad support is hard. The ad industry has diverse interests and Google is still facing a backlash over its failure to quell offensive videos on YouTube. Some of the types of ads derided in the Coalition's list, such as full-screen takeovers and automatic pre-roll video ads with sound, can deliver three to four times higher ad rates for publishers, according to Matt McGowan, president of marketing software firm Adestra Ltd. Many of these media companies are already suffering declining revenue as digital ad spending moves increasingly to Google's and Facebook's dominant platforms.  Stuart Ingis, a lawyer for Venable LLP who counsels the Coalition for Better Ads, said the group is still months away from issuing policies on "acceptable" ad standards. "All the options are on the table," he said.  An attempt from Google, the largest digital ad-seller, to limit other companies' ads through its browser could open the company to further antitrust scrutiny. Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, wrote on Twitter that she would "follow this new feature" closely. She is already overseeing a multi-pronged antitrust case against Google. As ad-blocking tools spread, Google has plotted ways to curb the potential impact on its primary business. Scott Spencer, a veteran director of its display ad unit, is in charge of its efforts and he sits on the Coalition board. In the past, Google has reportedly paid the makers of consumer ad-blocking tools to keep Google's ads off their blacklists. Owning a filtering solution, such as a built-in Chrome feature, would help Google avoid this. It also addresses the company's longstanding obsession with eliminating any obstacle between it and its users. "The situation tweaks the most paranoid part of Google's culture -- to never be disintermediated," said Ari Paparo, a former Google ad executive who runs ad tech company Beeswax. Chrome was launched in 2008 so Google's search engine would not be at the mercy of browser providers of the time such as Microsoft Corp. Leaders of the ads Coalition said other tech companies, like Microsoft and Facebook, will be involved in setting standards. "Something that's only one browser is not really worth it," said Rothenberg.  Yet, while the group is large, it is not comprehensive. Apple Inc., which controls the Safari browser on iPhones, and The Mozilla Corporation, which runs the Firefox browser, are not members of the Coalition. Firefox includes a browser setting that blocks ads and Apple began allowing third-party tools that block content on its mobile browser last year.  "Not everyone is going to be involved at the same time," Rothenberg said. "This ain't the UN." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Temporarily Share Your Location with Someone Using Google Maps By Justin Pot on April 21st, 2017 You’re meeting a friend downtown in a new city, and he asks you where you are. Be honest: you have no clue. Luckily, Google Maps can help you both out. This relatively new feature shows your location right on your friend’s map—and his on yours—even if you’re both moving around. And if you’ve got Google Maps open, it’s easy to start sharing your location, assuming the person you want to share locations with is also a Google Maps user. You know that blue dot that shows you where you are? Tap that blue dot and you’ll see a bunch of options, including sharing your location. You can choose how long to share your location—the default is one hour. Once you decide how long to share your location, you can then choose specific contacts to share your location with using the “Select People” button. You can scroll through your contacts and choose someone to share with. The list will be populated with Google users in your contacts list. If the person you want to share your location with is not on the list, you can also send a link via SMS or any messaging app. The person you share your location with will get a notification. When they click through, they will see your location on their map. The other user will also have the option to share their location with you, making it much easier for you to find each other. It’s like Harry Potter’s Marauder’s Map in real life. Well…almost. In our tests, updates didn’t come in real time, at least not if the other person isn’t actively using Maps. But even then, updates are frequent enough that you’ll see occasional updates, giving you more of an idea of how close you are to each other. It’s a simple feature, but one that can solve a pretty common problem. You just have to remember it exists the next time you’re trying to meet up with someone!

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google Voice now filters out unwanted calls… Google Voice now filters out unwanted calls, thanks to update By Adam Ismail — April 19, 2017 9:12 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Google Voice is a useful tool that was ignored for too long, but with January's major update and its new anti-spam measures, it's now more powerful than ever. The major update that hit Google Voice back in January was mostly aesthetic, as it brought the app up to date with the company’s Material Design standard, but didn’t add much in the way of new features. Many of those faithful to the long-running call forwarding service were just excited to see it get any attention from Google at all, after being largely ignored for a number of years. Fortunately, Google is keeping the updates coming with the announcement of improved spam filtering for Voice users. Last summer, Google took the initiative of adding anti-spam features to Nexus, Pixel, and Android One phones, allowing your device to warn you if you were receiving a ring from a “suspected spam caller.” Now, Google Voice is receiving the same functionality. These measures have resulted in twice as many caught spammers, 20 percent fewer spam reports from customers, and 40 percent more calls correctly identified as spam, according to Google. The steps to enable spam filtering in Voice have been laid out on the company’s support site. Previously, many of Voice’s features were added, over time, to Hangouts. Hangouts began as a messaging and internet-based calling app designed for regular users, but in recent months Google has decided to re-purpose it for enterprise customers. As a result, the app has dropped longstanding features like SMS support, and Google is propping up Voice to be its replacement for calling features — several years after it replaced Voice. All the features that made Voice groundbreaking back when it launched more than seven long years ago are still on board, such as the ability to text from the same number from any device, including your computer; voicemail transcription, and call recording. That last one in particular is still shockingly absent as a stock feature on smartphones, and Google’s app remains one of the only free and convenient ways to do it.

Google Maps v9.51 beta adds new details about parking, prepares to improve route planning with parking suggestions and traffic charts [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 11:17am PDTApr 21, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 42 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares113 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 New parking indicators 2 Teardown 2.1 Change your route to nearby parking 2.2 Traffic Histogram 3 Download It's time for another update to Google Maps. Like so many other version bumps, this one includes a couple of great gifts to get users where they want to go. The focus of this release appears to be directed at parking. There are now indicators to show if there is on-site parking and whether it's free or paid. The theme continues into the teardown with a feature that will help drivers plan to find parking near their destination before getting there. If you're already signed up to the beta, this update might already be waiting for you. Otherwise, you can hit the link at the bottom to download the apk. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Free / Paid indicator for parking on detail pages Destinations now show if there is on-site parking New parking indicators Google has been on a roll with parking-related features since they were introduced earlier this year. The latest update digs a bit deeper to inform drivers about the parking situation before getting to a destination. The first addition can be found in the details page, which indicates if parking at that location is free or paid. As the screenshot shows, the line can be found just below the address in most cases. However, parking details aren't available for very many locations yet, so you probably can't count on seeing it at most destinations. At this time, the field only shows if parking is free or paid, but doesn't appear to include prices for paid parking. To get prices, you'll probably still have to resort to other methods. Perhaps this will be added in a future update like it was with fuel prices. Left: previous version. Right: latest version. (Look for the red and blue markers.) The other adjustment comes in the form of a new type of parking difficulty indicator. In previous versions, Maps would show one of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Limited. The latest update adds On-site to the mix, which shows drivers if they can park at their destination or plan to search for a spot nearby. Unfortunately, this change does introduce something of a regression in usability. As the screenshots above show, the on-site indicator replaces the difficulty marker. If parking happens to be fairly terrible at your destination, you'll have no idea about that until you're driving around with no hope of finding an available space. Considering how much effort has gone into assessing parking difficulty, this will probably be fixed fairly soon. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Change your route to nearby parking Navigation apps are great for getting us to a place, but most of them have been designed with a bit of intentional tunnel vision. We might say we want to go to some place, but what we really mean is that we have to drive to a slightly different place to park, then walk (or whatever) to the real destination. The Google Maps developers are working to address this common scenario and help drivers make the decision to reroute to nearby parking. New text in the apk describes a feature that will prompt users to add a parking lot to their routes. Basically, it will offer to search for parking lots and garages near the destination and offer up a list. Users will then be able to pick a parking location, which will then be added to the route. code <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING">Adds the parking lot to the route.</string> <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING_LONG">Adds %1$s as a parking lot on the route</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING_NEAR_DESTINATION">Find parking near destination</string> <string name="ADD_PARKING">Add parking</string> <string name="EDIT_PARKING">Edit parking</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING">Find parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_QUERY">Parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_FAILED">Can't search</string> <string name="NO_PARKING_LOTS_FOUND">Can't find any parking lots or garages near there</string> <string name="PARKING_NEARBY_DESTINATION">near %1$s</string> Based on the wording, I assume the parking location will be placed immediately before the destination instead of replacing it, which makes sense if you need walking directions after parking the car. On the subject of walking, search results will be presented with an estimate of how long it will take to walk from a parking area to the final destination. <string name="SEE_MORE_PARKING_OPTIONS">See more options</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_GREATER_THAN_ONE">+%1$s walk</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_LESS_THAN_ONE"><1 min walk</string> There seems to be one catch: The parking recommendations seem to be incompatible with routes involving multiple stops. I doubt there's a technical reason these two features can't coexist, so it's probably a decision to avoid building an overcomplicated interface. <string name="PARKING_NOT_SUPPORTED_MESSAGE">Parking was removed because it's not supported for multiple stops</string> Overall, I think this is going to be a great addition and will save a lot of people from the pattern of first driving to a place and then driving in circles for another 15-20 minutes desperately searching for parking. Traffic Histogram For many years, Google has been able to tell us with bewildering accuracy just how long a drive should take. This isn't just a matter of calculating distance and speed limits, but also making estimates based on established traffic patterns. While it's nice to get an idea of the total time, some drivers certainly want to know if part of their trip is going involve slowly creeping through nearly standstill traffic. Google is working to put that information in front of users with a chart of anticipated traffic density throughout a drive. The string below spells out the concept pretty clearly. <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_TRAFFIC_TREND_BAR_CHART">A time-series histogram showing how much traffic is on your route today.</string> There's next to zero information beyond the string below, but I would expect the histogram to look like the busyness chart introduced late last year, but with shorter time increments – maybe every 10 or 15 minutes. Most people will probably see this as a "nice to know" type of feature, but it could be a life saver for drivers that get panicky in heavy traffic, or at least a useful tool for road trippers. I know I'd like to get a good look at traffic in a few spots before driving down to the Bay Area next month. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Verily’s Baseline study seeks to build a… Verily’s Baseline study seeks to build a perfect model of human health By Kyle Wiggers — April 19, 2017 10:41 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Verily's Baseline study could have huge implications for medicine, if things pan out as planned. Verily Life Sciences, formerly Google Life Sciences division, wants to build a model of perfect human health. To do so, it is launching Baseline, a multi-year study with thousands of volunteers who will regularly supply metrics on sleep, fitness, heart rate, genomics, and more. Baseline, which Google announced in 2014, seeks to “create a map of human health” — an “early discovery platform” that will nail down key correlations between physiological changes and disease. Verily, which is undertaking the study with Duke University and the Stanford Unversity School of Medicine, will enroll about 10,000 participants from half a dozen study sites in California and North Carolina. That is up from a pilot in about 200 people that began three years ago. “What we are really aiming to do is figure out how do we identify people who have a change in their health where we can make an intervention so they don’t come into the hospital?,” Adrian Hernandez, a professor of medicine at Duke, told Business Insider. Researchers will recruit subjects across a range ethnicities and age groups, including groups at risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease, to build a nationally representative sample. Participants will have their genomes sequenced and get blood work done at study sites run by Duke and Stanford. Over the course of a year, they will respond to survey questions and upload data from the Study Watch, a digital timepiece that measures electrodermal activity and heart rate. Verily’s current plan calls for a four-year study, the findings from which will be made available to “qualified researchers.” Jessica Mega, the chief research officer at Verily,  told The Verge that an “executive committee” will review and approve requests for data. Initially, the scope is limited to cancer and heart disease, but researchers hope to extend its length. That will depend on funding, partially — Bloomberg pegs the Baseline study’s cost at $300 million. Baseline may be Verily’s largest project yet, but it is far from its only one. The health spinoff, which has attracted funding from Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings and pharmaceutical companies like GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Johnson and Johnson, Biogen, and Dexcom, has been developing glucose-monitoring and autofocus contact lenses. It makes tableware designed to make it easier for people with hand tremors to eat independently, and it’s partnered with a surgical robot spin-out company and a bioelectronics company working to develop ways to use electric signals to treat chronic illnesses.

Until today, the answer to that question from the AI assistant nestled in Google’s Home smart speaker would have been a resounding “no.”  But the company has now rolled out a new feature that allows it to discern between the voices of six different users. And because each user’s voice can be linked to a separate profile, that means that it’s now able to tailor responses to questions directed at it. That’s a simple-sounding tweak that will make a big difference to the way the devices are used in the many households that now contain them. After all, people’s needs differ, and the new feature will mean that asking your Home speaker for, say, a rundown of your schedule will yield a personalized response, rather than the answer that the person who set up the device would like to hear. It’s a function that’s currently lacking in any other smart assistant, most notably Amazon’s Alexa. (Though, amusingly, only Amazon’s offering can allow you to add an event to your Google calendar. Home hasn’t picked up that skill yet.) It will also provide Google with another advantage—at least for now—over Amazon’s AI assistant. Home could use an edge: so far, Alexa has dominated the smart speaker sector. The implementation of Google’s new multi-user feature is simple enough: people have to train the device to recognize them by saying “OK, Google” and “Hey, Google” a few times and then it’s good to go. That means that it’s just the initial wake command, rather than your free-flowing gabbing, that’s used to identify you as a user. You might expect the feature to include the option to lock down the device to only the six users known to it, but so far that’s not the case. According to Wired, Google claims the loss of flexibility isn’t worth it, suggesting that it’s better to have your friends be able to ask the device questions when they’re visiting. Leaving Home open to anyone also means that if it misidentifies a voice for any reason—which it certainly could in noisy situations—the device can still respond. Even if it’s defensible, the decision not to at least offer an option of locking the device down to recognizable users seems like a strange one. First, it could offer at least a little protection to keep children or friends from making random purchases via your assistant. But it seems especially odd in the wake of last week’s Burger King debacle. In case you missed it, the fast-food chain launched an ad containing the line “OK, Google, what is the Whopper burger?” so that the search company’s Home assistant would read out the sandwich’s Wikipedia entry. It worked, too, sparking outrage—though the ruse was later blocked. The problem would, of course, have been solved if only specific users could control the device. But for now, at least, to AI assistants any voice is a commander.

The deal was announced today by Google, with Google Play Music now having the right to provide the right music for users of Samsung phones. According to the Lead Product Manager for Google Play Music, Elias Roman, the collaboration will also enable Google to “create special feature for Samsung customers.” In a blog post on Friday, Roman said: “Starting today with the launch of the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+, Google Play Music will be the default music player and music service on new Samsung phones and tablets globally. We’re also collaborating with Samsung to create special features in Google Play Music just for Samsung customers.” There is even greater news coming out from both companies; according to Google, anyone with a new Samsung phone or tablet can upload and stream up to 100,000 of their own songs to Google Play Music for free. Moving your personal music according to Roman is now easier and much fun since there is more storage space offered exclusively to Samsung customers—and that’s not all… Every new Samsung phone and tablet you buy will now come with a free three-month trial of Google Play Music. Don’t like ads? No problem; Google will also give you an “ad-free and on-demand access to more than 40 million songs and thousands of playlists tailored for any mood or occasion.” Access to YouTube Red [where available, according to Google] will also be available so you can enjoy your favorite videos ad-free. Bixby, Samsung’s new intelligent interface is also being configured to work along with Google Play Music. You will be able to ask the assistant to play your favorite song or music on Google Play Music, and without hesitation, it will start playing. When Bixby is launched later in the spring, you will have access to use the service same way Apple Siri and Amazon Alexa users have been using theirs. Give it up to the new look Google Play Music—the music service is spotting an attractive look, and is now focused on contextual recommendations. Google’s approach to most of its services has indeed changed; users are now the core of the company’s services. The revamped Google Play Music service was recently personalized by Google to suit your music taste. The service is now smarter, easier to use, and now based on the increasingly popular machine learning. Machine learning is now a big part of the revamped service. This will “figure out what music you like and then mixes in signals like location, activity, and the weather along with hand-picked playlists to personalize music for wherever you are and whenever you want tunes, Google’s Elias Roman, Lead Product Manager Play Music said last November. If it’s about getting the right music to suit a particular mood, the newly revamped app does it better than Spotify at the moment. Of course, Spotify has music for every mood, the problem is, it doesn’t refresh as often as Google Play Music does.

However, Google Now has so much more to offer than what consumers have come to expect from a personal assistant. Of course, Google Now can perform all of the usual services and tasks that digital assistants are capable of, such as set reminders, understand voice commands, tell us the weather, monitor activity, and so forth. The key difference with Google Now however, is its smart learning capabilities. Google Now is one of a few programmes in the world that gets better with consistent use. By engaging with Now more frequently, it is capable of learning more about the user and presenting them with content or information that they are much more likely to engage with. Now also differs from Siri and Cortana in the way that it is not platform specific. Whilst Cortana and Siri are limited to their proprietary devices, Now is available in app form through both iOS and Android OS, on the app store and Google Play store respectively. Google Now’s history began in earnest in 2011, when rumours circulated that the company was enhancing its voice software for the next range of Android devices, prompting ideas that Google would be releasing a Siri competitor. Google Now was unveiled the following year. However, the name Now had largely been phased out by October 2016 and This was due to Google’s increased drive to introduce Google Assistant as the company’s dominant personal assistant. But what does Google Now do these days?

Super interesting in fact. Besides the intriguing mournful saga of the Note 7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn’t just another smartphone—this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void—yikes! Advertisement With the stakes high, Samsung has delivered a device that legitimately stands out from the rest. The Galaxy S8 is a good enough phone that Samsung can likely leave that Note 7 drama behind. (Though, you know, we’re still waiting to see what unfortunate cataclysm will befall the S8 now.) Ultimately, what makes the S8 a winner isn’t any of the assistant smart features that manufacturers have been pushing hard over the last few years—in fact Samsung’s entrant here, Bixby, falls short. The S8 wins with an industry-leading hardware design that challenges the iPhone’s aesthetic supremacy. The Pixel (right) always looked dorky with it’s home button free bezel, but it looks even worse next to the micro-bezel on the S8+ (left). If you buy the Galaxy S8, you’re buying it because it’s the most beautiful phone available. While it falls short of being completely bezel-less, it might as well be. Though LG released a similarly bezel-less device earlier this year, it suffered from an excess of simplicity. Samsung is way ahead of most competitors you would realistically consider, like the Google Pixel, and the iPhone 7, which are both encased in unsightly prisons of bezel. The S8+ (left) versus last year’s S7 Edge (right). The design is a huge leap forward for Samsung, which has been inching in this direction for years with its edge display devices. This thing is practically all display on the front, and Samsung even got rid of its physical home button. The phone’s gently rounded edges and curves create the effect of a display that’s simply floating in the air or hovering just above your hand. There are no jarring interruptions to the minimal design. It feels like you’re looking at a phone from the future, rather than a tired rehash of a winning design from the past—unsurprisingly, Apple is reportedly considering a similar look for its forthcoming iPhone. Advertisement The S8 comes in two display sizes—a 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 ($750), and the 6.2-inch S8+ ($850). I tested the S8+, but the only difference between the two devices is size and price. Those display sizes make it difficult to compare them to other devices. Both S8s have an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, as opposed the more traditional 16:9 shape. Consequently the S8+ is a little thicker and taller than the iPhone 7 Plus, as well as very slightly narrower. Nitpicking aside, they’re basically the same size: The S8+ and iPhone 7 Plus (bottom). There’s been some debate about the merits of the new 18.5:9 aspect ratio (LG, again, did something similar this year, too). Most of the content you will view on websites, Netflix, Hulu, and so on is 16:9 so it fills up the entirety of devices like the iPhone. Meanwhile, watch the same content on the S8, and the picture will be surrounded by black bars. It feels wasteful, but, as you see in the image above, it isn’t the end of the world. Galaxy S8+’s display is bright and vibrant. Compared to the other phones you might consider buying these days, the S8's OLED is noticeably brighter and more vivid. Your photos will pop on this display. Bixby’s dashboard looks a lot like the old Google Now interface. Besides the hardware design, the other fresh addition in the S8 is Bixby, Samsung’s newly acquired digital assistant tech that’s meant to compete with Google Assistant, Apple’s Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa. Advertisement Sponsored At launch, Bixby will not support voice commands, though Samsung promises that feature will land this spring. I promised myself I wasn’t going to nail Samsung for shipping unfinished product (despite what happened the last time Samsung did). In the end I don’t need to. Most voice assistants are dumb as hell, including Google Assistant, which is also built into the S8, but Bixby’s bad enough that adding voice support wouldn’t even make a difference. Many of Bixby’s features seem amazing at first glance. Like the hardware button Samsung has built onto the side of the phone. It wakes Bixby up with a touch instead of a shout. There is nothing I hate more than invoking assistants by name. OK Google—tell me I sound like an asshole! Push the button, and Bixby’s Google Now-like dashboard display pops up, showing your appointments, the weather, and information from supported apps like Samsung Health and CNN. The Galaxy S8 is the prettiest phone you can buy right now. In practice, the additional hardware button just causes confusion. I frequently hit it instead of the volume down button, pulling up the assistant instead of taking a photo or reducing the loudness of my music. Worse, one morning when the S8's alarm clock woke me up ungodly early, I dumbly fumbled around for my phone and instead of waking it up to turn off my alarms, I was presented with all the meetings I had planned for the day, as if Bixby’s sole purpose was to remind my that my every waking hour will be toil and suffering. The assistant’s potentially most impressive feature is Bixby Vision, which allows you to use the phone’s camera to search by image. This kind of technology has existed from years—Amazon introduced an impressive feature called Flow three years ago. So it’s incredible how bad this feature is. When you tap the little Bixby Vision button in the S8's camera app, the tool takes a moment to process what you’re looking at, and then presents you with the option to use the image to do a general search, a shopping search, or in the event that it identifies wine or text, to treat the visual information accordingly. The only Bixby Vision tool that works with any level of consistency is the shopping tool, which identified a Monster energy drink (SUGAR FREE!) and a Neil deGrasse Tyson book correctly. When I pointed it at very expensive over-ear headphones headphones, it tried to sell me moderately priced earbuds, which fair enough, I don’t need to spend $900 on headphones. Bixby’s shopping search works reliably. The more general image search capability is a joke, and feels like a failure. The only image it was able to identify correctly is an old photograph by German documentary photographer August Sander. Sure, this is just a Pinterest search, but I’m having trouble figuring out what the hell the point of this is. Bixby’s Pinterest-powered search is not very useful for anything. As for the wine and text tools—they need serious work. The only time Bixby identified a wine bottle, I wasn’t pointing it at wine. The text tool has a hard job, and tends to interpret everything but the cleanest Helvetica typography as a garbled mess. Hello Bixby, you suck. Beyond the frustrating assistant, Samsung’s software is actually really nicely refined. TouchWiz, the company’s proprietary spin on Android, is no longer the unattractive horrorshow it was for years—mostly because Samsung has increasingly stayed out of Google’s way. Some of Samsung’s software additions are quite useful, like the Apps Edge drawer, which slides out a customizable collection of your favorite apps with a swipe from the right edge of the display It’s hard being this hard . Advertisement Advertisement Samsung’s camera is good enough for your snaps and ‘grams. There’s no dual camera like you’re finding on some other devices, but at least it comes with some built-in Snapchat Lens-like filters—Cool? The S8's most annoying quirk is the oddly-placed fingerprint sensor. Less cool is Samsung moving the fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone to the side of the camera was a mistake. It’s not placement on the back so much, which was likely necessary to make that beautiful bezel-less front. It’s that the sensor is off center so it lacks the intuitive feel of fingerprint sensors that are smack in the middle, as in the case of the Google Pixel and LG G6. What’s more, Samsung has gone and put the freaking camera exactly where your brain wants the sensor to be. Instagram your fried chicken dinner at your own risk. In the end, the Galaxy S8 handily smokes the Android competition as the top phone you can buy. It’s prettier and slicker than the Pixel, and though Bixby feels a little unfinished for the moment, you can still use Google Assistant. The S8 also measures up favorably with the iPhone 7, and whether you choose one or the other probably comes down to something as simple as whether you want Samsung’s forward-thinking ideas or Apple’s refined simplicity. Or maybe you want a headphone jack—the S8 has one! Advertisement As for whether you should upgrade, well, that’s another question entirely. How busted is your current phone? Is it broken and you need a new one? The S8 is a great option. Is your phone less than two years old and humming along fine? Wait until next year. What’s truly interesting about the S8 is just how compelling a phone can be on the merits of its great design alone. Bixby is basically rubbish, and yet the phone is a winner. Perhaps it shouldn’t be all that surprising: Top flagship phones with beefy specs are going to perform very well without fail these days. They all have good cameras and day-long battery life and processors that can chop through huge mobile games. It’s so challenging to make a device stand out that manufacturers are employing all manner of gimmicks, like voice assistants and modular accessories, to see if they can’t make their devices standout. None of those technologies improve your life quite as much as a design that plays into our crudest superficiality; I stare at my phone all goddamn day—I want to look at something pretty. README The prettiest phone you can buy right now. The new 18.5:9 aspect ratio doesn’t really make a huge difference, but you will notice black bars around your YouTube videos now. Bixby Vision is really only good as a shopping tool. Bixby, like all AI assistants, is too half-baked to be really useful in a life-changing way.

Dubbed Groq, the clandestine company has shared little of its plans or roadmap, though recent filings suggest more than $10m in funding has already been secured. More than four-fifths of the original Google TPU team are now working there. The TPU, or Tensor Processing Unit, is Google’s homegrown AI chip. The company began working on it several years ago, in the hope of making neural networking much more practical at scale. While machine learning isn’t new – Intel is working on enabling it with CPUs, while NVIDIA is coming at it from the opposite direction, with GPUs, among others – it’s computationally very intensive. That’s a problem when you’re running an operation on the scale that Google is. Neural networking and artificial intelligence are seen as essential to improving everything from search result accuracy, to computational image processing, through to spam and malware detection. AI also has a home in the Google Assistant, which is at heart of standalone devices like Google Home, but also features on Android smartphones and more. The result was the TPU, powering TensorFlow, a scalable system that opens neural networking up to everyone. It was developed in part by Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who is now working with investor Chamath Palihapitiya on the startup known today to be Groq. Also on the roster are a claimed eight of the first ten people from the TPU project. “It’s too early to talk specifics,” Palihapitiya told CBNC, “but we think what they’re building could become a fundamental building block for the next generation of computing.” Two SEC filings from last year confirmed both the name of the company and its initial funding. According to those documents – which name Palihapitiya, Ross, and former Google X engineer Douglas Wightman – Groq raised $10.3m. While taking on Google – not to mention Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA, among others – in developing a chip is a sizable challenge, the potential upshot if Groq’s technology proves successful is huge. Earlier this year, on a report into the TPU’s performance in real-world trials, Google claimed it had proved 10x more efficient at processing than using GPUs. That has implications for power consumption, chip cost, and more. NOW READ: Google has huge plans for its Tensor neural networking tech How far we are from seeing the fruits of Groq’s labors is unclear, and it seems likely that, if the company’s schemes are successful, they’ll be a tempting target for acquisition by some of the bigger names in chip development. AI is big business at the moment: only this week, Amazon opened up the artificial intelligence that powers its Alexa assistant to third-party developers and device manufacturers. ARM is positioning its low-power cores as ideal for AI, and Bosch and NVIDIA are doing something similar for the brains of self-driving vehicles.

Google Intelligent Machines Google’s New Chip Is a Stepping Stone to Quantum Computing Supremacy The search giant plans to reach a milestone in computing history before the year is out. by Tom Simonite April 21, 2017 John Martinis has given himself just a few months to reach a milestone in the history of computing. He’s leader of the Google research group working on building astonishingly powerful computer chips that manipulate data using the quirks of quantum physics. By the end of this year, Martinis says, his team will build a device that achieves “quantum supremacy,” meaning it can perform a particular calculation that’s beyond the reach of any conventional computer. Proof will come from a kind of drag race between Google’s chip and one of the world’s largest supercomputers. “We think we’re ready to do this experiment. It’s something we can do now,” says Martinis. One reason for his confidence is that Google’s roughly 25-strong group has made a new quantum chip that tests out key design features needed to make a device for that head-to-head contest. Quantum chips represent digital bits of data using qubits, devices that can shortcut through some tough calculations by exploiting the counterintuitive physics of quantum mechanics. Researchers have so far demonstrated quantum computing with only small groups of qubits, though. Google has released results from a chip that has nine qubits arranged in a line, but Martinis says he’ll need a grid of 49 qubits for his quantum supremacy experiment. Google’s latest chip has only six qubits, but they are arranged in a two-by-three configuration that Martinis says shows the company’s technology still works when qubits are nestled side by side, as they will be in larger devices. Google’s chip ready for testing. Google The six-qubit chip is also a test of a manufacturing method in which the qubits and the conventional wiring that controls them are made on separate chips later “bump bonded” together. That approach, a major focus of Google’s team since it was established just over two years ago, is intended to eliminate the extra control lines needed in a larger chip, which can interfere with how qubits function. “That process is all working,” says Martinis. “Now we’re ready to kind of move fast.” Designs for devices with 30 to 50 qubits are already in progress, he says. He briefly flashed up images of the six-qubit chip at the recent IEEE TechIgnite conference in San Bruno, California, but his group has yet to formally disclose technical details. Martinis joined Google in late 2014 from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he remains a professor today (see “Google Launches Effort to Build Its Own Quantum Computer”). His team is one of several industrial research groups recently formed or expanded thanks to growing signs that the technology behind quantum computing is becoming more tractable. The race to develop quantum processors includes Intel, Microsoft, IBM, and even startups (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2017: Practical Quantum Computers”).

Pulling off its quantum supremacy experiment this year would underline the search company’s competitiveness, although quantum processors would need to be much larger than 50 qubits to be capable of useful work. “It’ll be an academic milestone,” says Chris Monroe, a professor at the University of Maryland and cofounder of the quantum computing startup IonQ. “Afterward you still have to figure out how to make it more scalable and programmable.” Martinis agrees that much will remain to be done, but he argues that the experiment could become a benchmark for anyone claiming to have a working quantum computer. He also says the target has helped managers at Google, and the company’s cofounder Sergey Brin, appreciate that the technology is becoming real. “They all get it and are very excited about it,” says Martinis. “We’re trying to get support within Google, and this experiment has been very good to get other engineers talking to us.” Tech Obsessive?

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Mercedes-Benz Makes Customers’ Lives Easier with Google Home and Amazon Alexa SUNNYVALE, Calif., April 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Today, customers will be able to use both Google Assistant on Google Home and Amazon Alexa with all 2016 and 2017 Mercedes-Benz models in the United States. Customers are increasingly benefiting from seamless and intelligent interactions between Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected through their Mercedes-Benz cars. Voice-activated personal assistants are one such means of interaction, supported by robust artificial intelligence (AI). By connecting these powerful services to Mercedes-Benz’s vehicles, customers gain personalized engagement and experiences. Customers will be able to use Google Assistant on Google Home with all 2016 and 2017 Mercedes-Benz models in the United States. Customers will be able to use Amazon Alexa with all 2016 and 2017 Mercedes-Benz models in the United States. With targeted commands to their personal assistant-enabled and voice-enabled devices, customers will be able to activate various functions for their vehicles. Natural language understanding allows the services to interpret these commands and turn them into actions. For instance, customers with Google devices can simply say, „Ok, Google, tell Mercedes me to start my car,” and it will remotely start the customer’s car. Another available feature includes remote lock. With Alexa devices, customers can say, „Alexa, ask Mercedes me to send an address to the car” for remote navigation input and point-of-interest requests. „We want to offer our customers a broad range of services 24/7, not just when they are in our cars,” says Nils Schanz, Head of IoT and Wearable Integration at MBRDNA. „Mercedes-Benz’s goal is creating an intelligent ecosystem around cars, and developing cutting-edge technology to make everyday life more convenient for our customers.” Besides the devices, Mercedes-Benz customers will need an active Mercedes me account and an active mbrace© subscription. In order to link their accounts, customers will have to download the Google Home or Amazon Alexa app and connect it with Mercedes me. The service is now available in the United States. Europe will follow later this year. In December 2016, Mercedes-Benz announced the integration with the Google Assistant on Google Home. Today, Mercedes-Benz is one of the first carmakers to integrate Google Home with their vehicles. This integration signals a significant step forward in the company’s connectivity strategy.

Leaked Microsoft document confirms Windows 10 Cloud and a Chromebook competitor Called "Cloudbooks" by industry watchers, the specs mirror what a Chromebook offers. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 22 April, 2017 04:25 0 - - - - print email A Microsoft document detailing the minimum hardware specs for Microsoft Windows 10 Cloud-powered laptops seems to be the best evidence yet that Microsoft plans to launch a Chromebook competitor on May 2. Windows Central obtained a “recommended minimum spec” document, presumably handed out to Microsoft’s partners. The document outlines what Microsoft hopes to achieve with what the document calls an “Edu Cloud device” (and industry watchers have dubbed "Cloudbooks"): all-day battery life, a quick boot and resume cycle, and at least a quad-core Intel Celeron processor powering it all. It’s also titled “Windows 10 Cloud Performance Targets,” confirming the name of the new OS. A Microsoft representative declined to comment. Microsoft’s invitation to an education-focused launch event in New York on May 2 hinted strongly that a Chromebook competitor was in the cards Though Windows PCs dominate the workplace, Google’s Chrome OS-powered Chromebooks have quickly insinuated themselves into American classrooms. Google and its partners have pitched Chromebooks as affordable, simple to use and manage, and rugged enough to survive student use. Windows 10 Cloud appears to be Microsoft's attempt to go back to school. The impact on you: One key advantage of a Chromebook, from Google’s perspective, is that it contributes to a virtuous cycle: Kids use the popular Android tablets and phones at home, then access something similar in the classroom. To help break that chain, Microsoft needs to get kids used to Windows. While this may have little impact on you personally, you might say that this is a fight for the hearts and minds of your children. What Cloudbooks will contain Windows 10 Cloud reportedly will restrict apps to the Windows Store, forbidding the use of non-Store apps like Google Chrome. Microsoft’s document also notes that its performance benchmarks assume the use of Intune device management policies specifically designed for the classroom. The spec document plainly states that Microsoft considers Chromebooks its chief competition. In a comparison of “performance benchmarks,” Microsoft’s target is 10-plus hours of “all day” battery life, with cold-boot times of 20 seconds and resume times of under 2 seconds. The document does not list suggested pricing. Likewise, Microsoft lays out what hardware the new devices should include: a quad-core chip, like a Celeron, or higher; 4GB of RAM, and at least 32GB of eMMC or SSD storage. Interestingly, pen and touchscreen capabilities are listed as “optional,” which would discard one of the chief advantages that a typical Windows PC has over a Chromebook. Who will make these devices remains a mystery at the moment. PC companies like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo have all already built Chromebooks, meaning they’ll have to choose between platforms, or support both. It’s telling, though, that Microsoft itself admits at least internally that it Windows 10 Cloud-based laptops won’t quite measure up to the competition. In its comparison of the two platforms, the document notes that Chromebooks are faster to cold-boot to a login screen (20 seconds to 15 seconds) as well as from the sign-in screen to the desktop (15 seconds versus 10 seconds). We’ll have to see how Microsoft spins this: Selling something that's almost-as-good as the competition doesn’t sound like much of a pitch. 5 Reasons to Move to Cloud ERP Right Now More from MYOB Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Lilian Pintea, chief scientist with the Jane Goodall Institute, demonstrates features on Google Earth.  (Anick Jesdanun / AP)   By MATT STEVENSThe New York Times Fri., April 21, 2017 Google has launched a cool new Internet thing. And be warned: Your productivity may be about to take a tumble. Assuming you don’t mind descending down a rabbit hole, you may want to check out Voyager — a “showcase of interactive tours” meant to enhance the latest version of Google Earth. Voyager, which was introduced Tuesday, allows Earth’s bored employees to feed their wanderlust and pretend they are somewhere — anywhere — other than the office cubicle they are actually sitting in. Say you’ve never been to Paris. Voyager pairs the view provided by its maps with a still image and a so-called knowledge card to let users hop around the city as though they were on a packed three-day vacation. Similar tours of “Hemingway’s Hangouts,” Frank Gehry buildings and museums around the world are also available. Want a less urban experience? Jane Goodall will take you on a tour of a Tanzanian park and tell you about her team’s chimpanzee research. Article Continued Below You can even explore Afghanistan with Zari, a 6-year-old Muppet character who hails from the country. Zari loves to read and study — a fortunate trait because, as a knowledge card tells us, “Afghanistan is home to one of the largest populations of young people in the world, but their education system is struggling.” In a telephone interview, Rebecca Moore, director of Google Earth, called stories and storytelling the “linchpin” of the new Google Earth and said that Voyager would allow more people to tell such stories in more timely and compelling ways. “What you’re never going to find in Voyager is, ‘Here’s a tour of homes of celebrities,’” Moore said. “What we want to do is inspire people to explore the world through this interactive educational experience. We see it as a way to bridge cultures.” For more than a decade, Google Earth has allowed users to see the places they plan to visit before they actually do — or to revisit places they once knew. But as Google Earth became more ubiquitous, people found other ways to leverage it. Virtual flights over land and sea with Google Earth, it turned out, were an excellent way to learn about places, Moore said. “In an ad hoc, kind of grass-roots manner, people were using it to tell stories,” she said. “What we realized is we wanted to take it to the next level.” The latest update took two years to create, Gopal Shah, a Google Earth project manager, said in a blog post. Moore called it “our gift to the world,” noting that the tool is “not commercialized” in any way. Melissa Parrish, a research director at Forrester, a technology and marketing research firm, said that Google sometimes does create projects “just because they can.” But she said a company does not become as successful as the tech giant “without thinking about the monetization possibilities of everything they do.” Google may choose not to place ads directly on Google Earth or Voyager, Parrish said, but she added that every time a user clicks around the world, Google could presumably gather data it can use to target consumers elsewhere on the web. “They’re Google,” Parrish said. “If there’s one thing they’re incredible at, it’s making money.” Voyager is among a number of new features within the revamped Google Earth. There are dozens of virtual trips currently available — including one through New York City — and Moore promised more to come. In the latest version of Google Earth, an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button also emerges, allowing users to stumble upon random locations with a single click. (Kings Island amusement park in Mason, Ohio, anyone?) A new 3D button lets you see “any place from any angle” and share a “postcard” of the view, Shah said in the blog post. Eventually, Moore said, Google plans to create a set of easy-to-use storytelling tools that will allow anyone to create tours similar to those in Voyager. “This is a time when the world is getting factionalized,” she said. “And we need things to bring us together. We see Google Earth as making the world a smaller place — in a good way.” And you thought finding your old house was fun.

They are here to stay, with any moves made to render them useless by online publishers soon overcome. Google's revenue comes from advertising, meaning ad blocking is most certainly on its radar. So you may be surprised to hear the search giant is developing its own ad blocker for Chrome. This isn't a typical ad blocker, though. Google would rather you didn't block any of its adverts, but at the same time, it doesn't want users having a bad experience with poor advertising. And that's where this ad blocker comes in. According to The Wall Street Journal, Google's ad blocker would focus on adverts "beneath a threshold of consumer acceptability." Examples of below threshold advertising include auto-play videos with audio, pop-ups, and prestitial ads that delay access to a site's content using a countdown counter. And there's bound to be many more types. Google is still experimenting with the ad blocking system and could choose to shelve it. But if it doesn't, both desktop and mobile Chrome users should expect an announcement within the next few weeks about the new feature. As well as potentially offering users a better experience, an official ad blocker from Google would certainly help keep advertising partners and publishers in line. Any advert detected on a website that falls below the Google-defined threshold could see all advertising blocked, which directly impacts revenue. It simply isn't worth it to chance Google blocking your ads. This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 298 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares442 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read.

[Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares90 Deals News Pixel It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016.

Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question.

Starting today, Google’s voice-activated internet-connected speaker got a simple tweak that will go a long way in harnessing the device’s full potential: It can now distinguish between six different human voices, and pair them with the associated Google accounts. One of Google’s smart-hub devices can now handle up to six members of a household individually, serving each of them their personalized information. MORE: 72 Hours With Google Home Multiple people in a household can “talk to” their shopping lists, podcast subscriptions, commute information, Uber account, and daily schedules. The video above shows what that looks like in practical terms. MORE: 9 Google Maps Features You Didn't Know About This feature rolls out in the United States today and around the world and will land in the United Kingdom “in the coming months.” Before your friends, family, and roommates can act out such finely scripted marketing in the real world, they’ll need to train a neural network to recognize their voices. Fire up the Google Home app, where you’ll see a notification stating that “multi-user is now available.” The app will walk you through the setup process, and Google Home will then be able to recognize who’s speaking within “a matter of milliseconds.” It’s a shot over the bow at competing products like the Amazon Echo, which does not differentiate between voices.

Trending in Apple Here’s what the Hackintosh community wants in the new modular Mac Pro Yesterday AAPL: 142.27 -0.17 Apple creates new hardware team led by former Google execs Michael Potuck - Apr. 21st 2017 11:16 am PT @michaelpotuck Google Apple Maps View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit It’s well known that Apple is working hard to bring innovation to augmented reality and self-driving cars (in some capacity). However, new hires recently made by the company are making a satellite constellation project seem likely. AirPods A new Bloomberg report details that Apple has hired two former Google satellite executives as it starts a new hardware team. The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet Inc.’s Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. Satellite design and operation are highly expensive and the report notes that most projects in this field are focused on collecting images or for communications. An unnamed source shared that Boeing has plans to roll out a satellite broadband network and Apple has been it talks with the company about possible involvement. In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing Co. detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It’s unclear if those talks will result in a deal. However, Apple may be more interested in how this new hardware team headed by Fenwick and Trela could improve its maps services and possible integration with future AR features. It’s already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries LLC, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. This seems a more likely focus for this new endeavor as Fenwick and Trela’s direct report Greg Duffy has mostly image and video product experience from his time at Dropcam. The unnamed source(s) close to this matter also pointed out that Apple’s SVP of hardware engineering, Dan Riccio, will oversee this team as he already does for Apple’s AR work.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 04.21.17. 04.21.17 Time of Publication: 2:08 pm. 2:08 pm The Hidden Laborers Training AI to Keep Ads Off Hateful YouTube Videos Getty Images Every day across the nation, people doing work for Google log in to their computers and start watching YouTube. They look for violence in videos. They seek out hateful language in video titles. They decide whether to classify clips as “offensive” or “sensitive.” They are Google’s so-called “ads quality raters,” temporary workers hired by outside agencies to render judgments machines still can’t make all on their own. And right now, Google appears to need these humans’ help—urgently. YouTube, the Google-owned video giant, sells ads that accompany millions of the site’s videos each day. Automated systems determine where those ads appear, and advertisers often don’t know which specific videos their ads will show up next to. Recently, that uncertainty has turned into a big problem for Google. The company has come under scrutiny after multiple reports revealed that it had allowed ads to run against YouTube videos promoting hate and terrorism. Advertisers such as Walmart, PepsiCo, and Verizon, ditched the platform, and much of the wider Google ad network. Google has scrambled to control the narrative, saying the media has overstated the problem of ads showing up adjacent to offensive videos. Flagged videos received “less than 1/1000th of a percent of the advertisers’ total impressions,” the company says. Google’s chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, says the issue affected a “very very very small” number of videos. But ad raters say the company is marshalling them as a force to keep the problem from getting worse. ‘We know very well that human eyes—and human brains—need to put some deliberate thought into evaluating content.’ Former Ad Rater Because Google derives 90 percent of its revenue from advertisers, it needs to keep more from fleeing by targeting offensive content—fast. But users upload nearly 600,000 hours of new video to YouTube daily; it would take a small city of humans working around the clock to watch it all. That’s why the tech giant has emphasized that it’s hard at work developing artificially intelligent content filters, software that can flag offensive videos at a greater clip than ever before. “The problem cannot be solved by humans and it shouldn’t be solved by humans,” Schindler recently told Bloomberg. The problem is, the company still needs humans to train that AI. So Google still depends on a phalanx of human workers to identify and flag offensive material to build the trove of data its AI will learn from. But eight current and former raters tell WIRED that, at a time the company is increasingly reliant on ad raters’ work, poor communication with Google and a lack of job stability are impairing their ability to do their jobs well. “I’m not saying this is the entire reason for the current crisis,” says a former Google ad rater, who was not authorized to speak with WIRED about the program. “But I do believe the instability in the program is a factor. We raters train AI, but we know very well that human eyes—and human brains—need to put some deliberate thought into evaluating content.” Human Tasks Tech companies have long employed content moderators, and as people upload and share more and more content, this work has become increasingly important to these internet giants. The ad raters WIRED spoke with explained that their role goes beyond monitoring videos. They read comment sections to flag abusive banter between users. They check all kinds of websites served by Google’s ad network to ensure they meet the company’s standards of quality. They classify sites by category, such as retail or news, and click links in ads to see if they work. And, as their name suggests, they rate the quality of ads themselves. In March, however, in the wake of advertiser boycotts, Google asked raters to set that other work aside in favor of a “high-priority rating project” that would consume their workloads “for the foreseeable future,” according to an email the company sent them. This new project meant focusing almost exclusively on YouTube—checking the content of videos or entire channels against a list of things that advertisers find objectionable. “It’s been a huge change,” says one ad rater. ‘I’m worried if I take too long on too many videos in a row I’ll get fired.’ Ad Rater Raters say their workload suggests that volume and speed are more of a priority than accuracy. In some cases, they’re asked to review hours-long videos in less than two minutes. On anonymous online forums, raters swap time-saving techniques—for instance, looking up rap video lyrics to scan quickly for profanity, or skipping through a clip in 10-second chunks instead of watching the entire thing. A timer keeps track of how long they spend on each video, and while it is only a suggested deadline, raters say it adds a layer of pressure. “I’m worried if I take too long on too many videos in a row I’ll get fired,” one rater tells WIRED. Ad raters don’t just flag videos as inappropriate. They are asked to make granular assessments of their title and contents—classifying them, for instance, as containing “Inappropriate Language,” such as “profanity,” “hate speech,” or “other.” Or “Violence,” with the subcategories “terrorism,” “war and conflict,” “death and tragedy,” or “other.” There’s also “Drugs” and “Sex/Nudity” (with the subcategories “abusive,” “nudity,” or “other”). The system also provides the ad rater with an option for “other sensitive content”—if, say, someone is sharing extreme political views. (AdAge recently reported that Google is now allowing clients to opt out advertising alongside “sexually suggestive” and “sensational and shocking” content, as well as content containing “profanity and rough language.”) Some material doesn’t always fit neatly into the provided categories, ad raters say. In those cases, raters label the material as “unrateable.” One current rater described how he had to evaluate two Spanish-speaking people engaged in a rap battle. “I checked it as unrateable because of the foreign language,” he told WIRED. “I also added a comment that said it seems like this is a video of people insulting each other in a foreign language, but I can’t exactly tell if they are using profanity.” (Judging from recent ad-rating job openings, one former rater said, Google seems to be prioritizing hiring bilingual raters. Workers can also check a box when a video is in a language they don’t understand.)

The person set the truck on fire, the rater said, then exited the truck and committed suicide with a shot to the head. In the online forums frequented by ad raters, anonymous posters said they had seen videos of violence against women, children, and animals. Several posters said they needed to take breaks after watching several such videos in a row. Ad raters said they don’t know how Google selects the videos they will watch—they only see the title and thumbnail of the video before they rate it, not a rationale. Other typical content in videos raters are tasked to watch include people talking video games, politics, and conspiracy theories. Taken together, the scope of the work and nuance required in assessing videos shows Google still needs human help in dealing with YouTube’s ad problems. “We have many sources of information, but one of our most important sources is people like you,” Google tells raters in a document describing the purpose of their ad-rating work. But while only machine intelligence can grapple with YouTube’s scale, as company execs and representatives have stressed again and again, until Google’s machines—or anyone else’s—get smart enough to distinguish, say, truly offensive speech from other forms of expression on its own, such efforts will still need to rely on people. “We have always relied on a combination of technology and human reviews to analyze content that has been flagged to us because understanding context in video can be subjective,” says Chi Hea Cho, a spokesperson for Google. “Recently we added more people to accelerate the reviews. These reviews help train our algorithms so they keep improving over time.” Human Resources The ads quality rater program started in 2004, two sources told WIRED. It was modeled after Google’s (much talked-about) search quality evaluation program, and initially served Google’s core ad initiatives: AdWords, which generates ads that correspond to search results and AdSense, which place ads on websites through Google. The original hiring agency for ad raters, ABE, paid ad raters $20 an hour. They could work full-time and even overtime, one former rater said. In 2006, WorkForceLogic acquired ABE, after which raters say working conditions became less favorable. A company called ZeroChaos bought WorkForceLogic in 2012 and contracts with ad raters today. Ad rating work often attracts people who prefer more flexible working conditions, among them college graduates who have just entered the workforce, workers nearing retirement age, stay-at-home parents, and individuals with physical disabilities. Ad raters can work wherever and whenever they want, as long as they fulfill the 10-hour weekly minimum work requirement. Raters only need their own desktop computer and mobile device to work with. The scope of the work and nuance required in assessing videos shows Google still needs human help. But the inherent instability of the job can take a toll on many workers. “Most of us love this job,” one ad rater tells WIRED, “but we have no chance of becoming permanent, full-time employees.” Most of the ad raters who spoke to WIRED were hired through ZeroChaos—just one of several agencies that provide temporary workers to tech companies. ZeroChaos hires ad raters on one-year contracts, and at least until very recently, they could not stay on the job after two years of continuous work. Some workers believed this limit deprived the company of experienced raters best qualified to do the work. (In early April, during our reporting on this story, ZeroChaos notified ad raters that it was ending the two-year limit.) Ad raters do not get raises—they earn $15 per hour and can work a maximum of 29 hours a week. They get no paid time off. They can sign up for benefits if they work at least 25 hours per week, but they have no assurance they will have enough tasks to meet that threshold. Workers say they can find themselves dismissed suddenly, without warning and without a reason given—something multiple employees say has happened to them, one after only a week on the job. The company notifies workers of termination with a perfunctory email message. “Google strives to work with vendors that have a strong track record of good working conditions,” says Cho. “When issues come to our attention, we alert these vendors about their employees’ concerns and work with them to address any issues. We will look into this matter further.” ZeroChaos declined to comment. A lack of clear communication with Google itself compounds the feelings of job insecurity ad raters have, they say. They don’t meet anyone they work for in person—including during the job interview process—and Google gives raters only a generic Google email for the “Ads Evaluation Administrative team,” telling the raters to use it only for task-related issues. When raters email the address, they only receive an auto-response. “Because of the volume of reports received, administrators do not respond to individual problem reports: instead, we monitor incoming reports to detect system-wide problems as quickly as possible,” Google’s reply reads. “If you need an individualized response, or a specific action taken on your account, contact your contract administrator instead.” “The communication from Google was totally nonexistent,” one former rater said. “Google is legendary for not communicating.” “The people at the other end of this pipeline in Mountain View are like the wizard behind the curtain,” another former rater said. “We would like very much to communicate with them, be real colleagues, but no.” Related Video How Do You Make a Video Go Viral? Unruly Media’s Sarah Wood Explains For its part, Google does inform raters that they’re doing important work, even if it doesn’t spell out exactly why. “We won’t always be able to tell you what [each] task is for, but it’s always something we consider important,” the company explains in orientation materials for ad raters. “You won’t often hear about the results of your work. In fact, it sometimes might seem like your work just flows into a black hole… Even though you don’t always see the impact, your work is very important, and many people at Google review it very, very closely.” Sometimes too closely for some workers’ comfort. Google incorporates already-reviewed content into ad raters’ assignments to gauge their performance. “These exams appear as normal tasks, and you will acquire them along with your regular work,” an email to an ad rater from Google reads. “You will not be able to tell which tasks you are being tested on … We use exam scores to evaluate your performance. Very low scores may result in your assignment being ended.” Embedding questions with known answers is a common practice in crowdsourcing research, according to Georgia Tech AI researcher Mark Riedl. The strategy is often used to determine whether a researcher should throw out data from an individual who might be clicking randomly, he explains, and it’s often jokingly called the Turing Test among practitioners. But Riedl says he doesn’t care for the Turing Test reference. “It perpetuates an attitude that crowd workers are machines when instead we need to recognize that crowd workers are humans, for whom we have an ethical and moral responsibility to design tasks that recognize the dignity of the worker,” he says. To be sure, not all ad raters find fault with the issues raised by some of their fellow workers. The $15-per-hour rate is still above most cities’ minimum wages. One ad rater told me he was grateful for the opportunity ZeroChaos gave him. “[ZeroChaos] didn’t care about a criminal background when even McDonald’s turned me down,” the rater said. Multiple raters said they’d been close to homelessness or needing to go on food stamps when this job came along. But others say the flexibility often doesn’t end up working in their favor, even as they come to depend on this job. Working from home and choosing one’s own hours are perks. But according to a ZeroChaos FAQ, ad raters are prohibited from working for other companies at the same time. One former ad rater says she is now doing temp work for another company through ZeroChaos and would also like to resume doing ad rater work to help make ends meet but can’t because of the restriction. “If I could work jobs simultaneously, that would be great, a living wage,” she says. “Right now, I’m earning $40 a week more than I did on unemployment. That’s not sustainable.” The Human-AI Connection Big companies across the tech industry employ temporary workers to participate in repetitive tasks meant to train AI systems, according to multiple ad raters WIRED spoke with. One ad rater described a job several years ago rating Microsoft Bing search results, in which human evaluators were expected to go through as many as 80 pages of search results an hour. LinkedIn and Facebook employ humans for similar tasks too, raters told me—LinkedIn for data annotation, and Facebook for rating “sponsored posts” from fan pages. (Microsoft declined to comment, while LinkedIn could not confirm such a program. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.) The overall job insecurity of temp work and widespread turnover unsettles current and former employees, who argue Google is losing the institutional knowledge possessed by workers who have spent more time on the job. “They’re wasting money by taking the time to train new people then booting them out the door,” says one former ad rater. But churning through human ad raters may just reflect best practices for making AI smarter. Artificial intelligence researchers and industry experts say a regular rotation of human trainers inputting data is better for training AI. “AI needs many perspectives, especially in areas like offensive content,” says Jana Eggers, CEO of AI startup Nara Logics. Even the Supreme Court could not describe obscenity, she points out, citing the “I know it when I see it” threshold test. “Giving ‘the machine’ more eyes to see is going to be a better result.” But while AI researchers agree in general that poor human morale doesn’t necessarily cause poor machine learning, there may be more subtle effects that stem from one’s work environment and experiences. “One often hears the perspective that getting large amounts of diverse inputs is the way to go for training AI models,” says Bart Selman, a Cornell University AI professor. “This is often a good general guideline, but when it comes to ethical judgments it is also known that there are significant ingrained biases in most groups.” For example, Selman says, the perception that men are better at certain types of jobs than women, and vice versa. “So, if your train your AI hiring model on the perceptions of a regular group of opinions, or past hiring decisions, you will get the hidden biases present in the general population.” And if it turns out you’re training your AI mainly on the perceptions of anxious temp workers, they could wind up embedding their own distinct biases in those systems. “You would not want to train an AI ethics module by having it observe what regular people do in everyday life,” Selman says. “You want to get input from people that have thought about potential biases and ethical issues more carefully.” Googlers at the company’s sprawling Mountain View headquarters enjoy a picturesque campus, free gourmet cafeteria food, and rec room games like pool and foosball. That’s a far cry from the life of a typical ad rater. These days, working for the world’s most valuable tech companies can mean luxurious perks and huge paydays. It can also mean toiling away as a temp worker at rote tasks, training these companies’ machines to do the same work. Have any secrets you want to share? Use WIRED SecureDrop.

 Apple just nabbed two top Google executives to run a secret hardware team Kif Leswing Apr. 21, 2017, 1:45 PM 4,516 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Apple may be working on satellites. The company best known for the iPhone has hired two Google executives who were working on building satellites for the search giant, Bloomberg reported on Friday. John Fenwick and Michael Trela joined Apple in recent weeks from Google, and they'll report to Greg Duffy, who was the founder of Dropcam, which was bought by Alphabet-owned Nest.  Duffy joined Apple earlier this year. The Information reported that he was leading "a special project at Apple that is operating like a startup within the company."  Bloomberg suggests that Apple may be working on satellites that distrubute broadband service, as Facebook and Google have experimented with in the past. According to the report, Apple bought a company called Aether Industries LLC in 2015 that specialized in "near-space technology."  At a recent satellite conference, Apple was rumored to be backing a Boeing plan to launch 1000 satellites for providing broadband internet access.  Of course, Apple is working on lots of stuff, and Duffy's background is in consumer products, such as the web-connected security camera Dropcam. We reached out to Apple. There are a lot more details over at Bloomberg.  SEE ALSO: Apple hired the Dropcam founder who clashed with Tony Fadell NOW WATCH: I wear these computer glasses every day even though I have perfect vision — here's why Loading video...

Samsung To Make Google Play Default Music App On All Devices Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Samsung To Make Google Play Default Music App On All Devices April 21, 2017 12:58 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler devices Galaxy S8 google Google Music Play music samsung smartphone Streaming Service teaming up If you’re planing to order one of Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 devices today, you’ll also be getting a little bit more — or at least Google hopes you do: Google Play Music streaming service will now be the default music app on Samsung devices.  Google announced Friday that in a bid to increase subscribers of its streaming service it struck a deal with Samsung to make Google Play Music the default player and service on all Samsung devices from now on. Through the partnership, Google says it will offer new Samsung owners a three-free month trial of Google Play Music and YouTube Red, the company’s ad-free video subscription service. While Google no doubt hopes that making Google Play Music the default system for Samsung devices will translate in more subscribers, that doesn’t have to be the case. Instead, after the trial Google Play Music will allow users to upload 100,000 tracks of their own music to stream. That figure is double the 50,000 tracks Google typically allows customers to upload. In addition to adding Google Play Music front and center on its devices, Samsung says that its virtual assistant Bixby will work with the streaming service. This means subscribers will be able to ask Bixby to play their favorite song or music for dancing and it’ll start playing on Google Play Music instantly.

In his visit Obama spoke on his position of Net Neutrality, keeping the internet a free, open network. (Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images)    Google Donated $285,000 To Trump’s Inauguration Despite Avid Hillary, Democrat Support Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 1:28 PM 04/21/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5607540 Google donated $285,000 to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, even though Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google’s parent company Alphabet, is not shy about his support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party in general. The donations were made public through official Federal Election Commission filings (pages 43, 163 of 510). Alphabet CEO Eric Schmidt, who used to directly run Google, was spotted wearing a “staff” badge during Clinton’s election night party. Emails leaked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta show Schmidt was working “directly” with the presidential campaign. Schmidt eventually wanted to become the official “head outside advisor” to her campaign, according to other pieces of electronic communication exposed by WikiLeaks. Aside from Schmidt, Google as a company supported Clinton and Democratic ideals, whether overtly and deliberately or unintentionally. Alphabet was the second largest contributor to Clinton’s campaign during the 2016 cycle, according to Open Secrets. Google was also accused of burying negative search suggestions for Clinton. (RELATED: Google Excludes Trump From List Of Active Presidential Campaigns) The tech giant reportedly spearheaded the funding efforts for the legal brief signed by nearly 100 companies that objected to President Donald Trump’s immigration ban. “It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who was born in India, according to Bloomberg News. The co-founder of Google, Sergey Brin, a Russian-born American who immigrated from the Soviet Union, was reportedly seen at the San Francisco airport over the weekend in order to protest with others. Schmidt also made some harsh claims about Trump to employees in late January. “I can tell you that the tone of this government is very much economic growth,” Schmidt said, according to BuzzFeed News, in an apparent attempt to criticize Trump. “And so I think at the end of the day, they are going to do these evil things as they’ve done in the immigration area and perhaps some others.” Aside from levying criticisms towards Trump, Schmidt, in general, has multiple connections to Clinton, whether its through her campaign for president or her and former President Bill Clinton’s foundation. (RELATED: EXPOSED: The Corrupt Clinton Foundation You’ve Never Heard Of) And it’s not just recent. Google and its affiliates convened at the White House 427 times for meetings during President Barack Obama’s tenure. That’s why the filings showing Google donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump’s inauguration seems somewhat odd. Perhaps Google is trying to hedge their bets, or play both sides of the aisle, in order to reap the benefits of having the political leadership’s blessing at all times.

Recent hires suggest the company is now also looking to the skies.  The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet Inc.'s Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about Apple's private plans. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Google. Fenwick, Trela and Duffy didn't respond to requests for comment.  With the recruits, Apple is bringing into its ranks two experts in the demanding, expensive field of satellite design and operation. At the moment, these endeavors typically fall into two fields: satellites for collecting images and those for communications.  In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing Co. detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal.  At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.  "It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation," Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025.  A lure for technology companies like Apple, Google and Facebook Inc. is to connect billions of people who don't have internet access yet. The broadband services being explored by Boeing and others would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems. "You have a new wave of enthusiastic people who aren't inhibited by the hard knocks of the past," said Roger Rusch, who heads satellite consulting firm TelAstra Inc. Still, TMF's Farrar said there's no guarantee Apple will get involved in the Boeing project. The satellite industry is littered with bankruptcies and other failures. Satellite telephone company Iridium LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, and Teledesic abandoned its "internet from the sky" plan more than a decade ago.  Indeed, Apple may have hired the Google executives for something other than satellite work. It's already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries LLC, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. Duffy, Fenwick and Trela's new boss, has mostly consumer product experience from Dropcam. It's internet-connected security camera stored images and video of homes and sent alerts to a smartphone app. Alphabet's Nest acquired the business in 2014. After a tumultuous stint there, Duffy joined Apple to form a new team reporting Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple's augmented reality efforts, the people familiar with the matter said. Fenwick and Trela joined Alphabet's Google in 2014 when the search giant acquired Skybox Imaging, their satellite-imaging startup, for $500 million. However, this year Google sold the renamed business, Terra Bella, to startup Planet Labs Inc., a one-time Skybox rival. Google also planned to invest about $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler, however Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb Ltd., and Google ended up investing $1 billion in SpaceX.  Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University. -- With assistance from Alex Webb, Julie Johnsson and Ashlee Vance Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

[Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares90 Deals News Pixel It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016.

Plastc joins the likes of Coin, declaring bankruptcy Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 2:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 News Some of you might remember Plastc. They were a company that jumped on the re-programmable credit card train Coin and Google Wallet started in '13 and '12, respectively. They may have been a bit later to the game in 2014 after even Google had decided that it wasn't a good idea anymore, but they made the attempt. Later even the funding-successful Coin had to close shop due to delays, problems, and a general failure to properly keep up with the market. Unlike Coin, though, Plastc never managed to actually deliver on a product. And now just like its forebears, Plastc has decided it's time to die. This news isn't entirely surprising. Plastc's preorder update messages started verging on the Saygus-esqe: making promises of more features and upgrades, and fewer mentions of actual dates. The Plastc subreddit even decided seven months ago that the business had become a scam and was recommending people to steer clear. The company nonetheless raised in excess of $ 9 million in preorders, which is quite a lot to cut and run with. Plastc, unlike Coin, never actually managed to make or deliver a product to anyone who purchased it. Hopefully at least some of the money is left to return to backers. If not, given the quantity of cash there's always the chance of a decent lawsuit against whatever or whoever is left standing after the bankruptcy settles. The full details of their message to those who preordered are too long to quote here, but their bankruptcy statement is included below.Feel free to check out the full details at the source link. We Regret to Inform You... For the past 3 years, our mission here at Plastc was to build and deliver the most technically ambitious smart card on the planet. After making enormous leaps in development, product innovation and progress towards our goal, Plastc has exhausted all of its options to raise the money it needs to continue. Plastc, Inc. is exploring options to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and will cease operations on April 20, 2017. While we have fallen short of our goal, we are proud of our team and the effort that went into developing a working Plastc Card. However, without the necessary capital to continue, all employees have been let go, which means that Customer Care and Social Media channels are unmanned or have been shut down.

Is there any recourse to a refund at this point? David Ruddock Declaring bankruptcy probably doesn't bode well for refunds, no. KlausWillSeeYouNow No kidding...But what about people who submitted a refund request before they declared bankruptcy that was never answered? That's the boat I'm in. Ryne Hager Bankruptcy might interfere with that. Thankfully there's always the potential recourse of personal liability on the part of whoever owned the joint. That's gonna depend on something like a class action, though. justmy2pennies2012 With BK filings, there is a "window" (0-6 months) where payments are reviewed to make it fair/equal for all creditors. Basically, if you paid some a higher percentage than others, they may have to pay money back into a "pool" so other creditors can benefit. Also, they are different classes of creditors and investors. Tax and other Government Agencies Shareholders and secured creditors (lienholders) Other Liabilities and Payroll (everybody else). Christina B. Try your bank and claim fraud. If that don't work a class action lawsuit has been started. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ You can always try to get your bank or credit card issuer to do a chargeback. Technically they aren't supposed to do it beyond a certain point, but under certain circumstances they may do it for you, even after a couple of years. justmy2pennies2012 for a debit transaction, maybe 60-90 days. Credit, it wasn't "fraud" plus if you are past 90 days, good luck with that. Banks will only reverse if they can reasonably get the money back. Under BK, the assets are frozen , so this is slim and none. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It may be anecdotal, but I got Bank of America to do a chargeback for me in July of 2014. A company that was holding a 5K here in 2013 was unable to run it on the day of due to a fire, so instead of rescheduling it they just said everyone would get to do it free the next year. However in July the next year they went bankrupt and closed. After explaining the situation to my bank they reversed the charge that was by then nearly 2 years old for me no problem. infiniteh I'm so glad that I got my refund when I did. Aaron Huffman I 'pre ordered' and I've been very excited for it for so long however there is a big thing I have on this. All these news entries are saying raised $9M from backers or pre orders and all that however near the end of the pre order email I have it shows plain as day just as my bank statements: "Your card will be charged at time of shipping." tldr; I was not charged a dime because they weren't shipping. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ There seems to be differing stories on this. Some email screenshots in /r/plastc don't show that line in the email and the posters have claimed they were in fact charged. If you didn't get charge, count yourself lucky you won't have to deal with the headache of losing $150 and trying to get it back. Aaron Huffman That's all between Stripe payment and Plastc because things just have been working the way they should for me also the Plastc charge has been a gut feeling in me for about 3 years to always keep that $150 in my bank account so I can get my shipment on time when they are ready because I'm not the best at my finances yet. I've been watching my emails and bank like a hawk waiting for either a charge, an update or a decline on my card from Plastc. Jrbl I also 'pre ordered', but on black Friday in 2015, because they were offering a "pay when it ships" black Friday deal so fortunately, I wasn't charged either. sbeaulieu Was sure this was a second post about Saygus Ryne Hager Thank David for the picture idea. crutchcorn Why is Mr. Davenport standing on the tombstone?

Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

IIRC Coin wasn't a Kickstarter project, but a pre order/website style deal. And they didn't go bankrupt, Fitbit bought them. :) (Source: http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/no-more-products-from-digital-wallet-startup-coin) Ryne Hager As someone who gave Coin money I should have known that, I could have sworn. Fixed! davidofmidnight "As someone who gave Coin coin" FIFY mcored Well Znaps didn't even openly admitted they will not deliver. Plastic at least did. Regardless, bad news for backers. abqnm Should have hired the people behind Saygus. Barry Kaufman All of these credit card replacement concepts are eventually going to die out. Apple Pay and Android Pay make way more sense in the long run simply because you already have your phone. Cory S and I'm not really eager to hand it to my waitress. Aaron On table kiosks like you see at some chain restaurants already. I haven't seen one with tap and pay yet but it's probably only a matter of time. Cory S Those are neat, but I don't think you really got my point. They will never be ubiquitous. Especially at higher end eateries and bars. Heck, a good time to do something like that would had been during the chip conversion for POS systems...but most of the places I go to replaced their systems with ones that you still have to hand them your card for them to insert in a terminal behind the counter. I'm not saying Plastc would had been perfect (frankly I think it was always a scam). or had even worked well at all being how hard it would had been for them to get access to EMV encryption data to make payments, but the idea of a programmable credit card is a good one. Think about a card that auto selects whichever card that would give you the highest reward at the particular store you are at. Aaron What you're suggesting sounds good in theory, but in practice I think you are asking too much of the store front. They would have to be on board with the maker of whichever card maker you have for the tech to choose which actual credit account to use. I don't think that could easily be built into the card itself. And if additional hardware is required that won't be much if any better than the slow rollout and conversion to contactless payments. I guess I just feel like the credit card is starting to become antiquated similar to how the checkbook became after credit card tech started to get more sophisticated. I'm not saying that they'll go away anytime soon, but in 20 years how much more advanced and ubiquitous will smart technology be? Credit cards will be for old people who are behind the times. Cory S That wouldn't have anything to do with the storefront being in board. It would simply work off meta data and consult it's database. "I'm at Target load up 5% cashback at grocery stores Discover card". A phone could do the same thing, but a card is always going to be more versatile due to being able to give it to someone. Nicholai Cascio Cool idea. Is there a decent, reprogrammable card out there that I could use? t_newt There's one more digital pay card out there: The LG Pay 'White Card', coming out in June (in Korea) http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/lg-g-pay-news/ Christina B. That's good in S. Korea only Christina B. I put in a fraud claim with my bank! So those fuckers will have to deal with the bank that's how you get your money back! Erroneus I guess they had a talk with Fit-Pay, one of their partners and the scammers behind Pagaré NFC strap. jeffhesser It's too bad. Love the idea. If anyone gets this right, I think it's a better idea than trying to move entirely to 'mobile payments' Madis I was very curious to see what would come out of this. Didn't buy one though as they pulled a Pushbullet (made it subscription-based instead of one-time purchase like they originally claimed, though early adopters claimingly got away with no subscription). Mike Jones i pre-ordered a Coin. then they started delaying their product. someone on the Coin forum was 100% unapologetic and pretty much said "quit complaining, you can get pre-order refund if you don't like it". at that point i knew this was a company that would not survive. i got my refund instantly.

Name: Subject: Message: The first 10 things to do on your new Galaxy S8 Features Newsby Kris Carlon12 hours ago 12 900 14 If this were a week ago I would have recommended you remap Bixby to Google Assistant, but with that tip no longer an option, what other tips can we give new Galaxy S8 owners? I’m glad you asked. See also: Samsung Galaxy S8 gets put through extreme torture test 2 days ago Forget Bixby I know this is going to elicit howls of anger from the Samsung faithful, but no matter which way you cut it, Bixby is a half-baked voice assistant. No matter how much potential it might have by the end of the year (and I’ll be happy to revisit my current condemnation at that time), right now it’s not terribly helpful, resembling first-generation Google Now. So play around with Bixby for a little while if you like, but you’d be much better off wrapping your head around what Google Assistant can do instead. Not only is Assistant far more advanced, it can also follow you from one phone to another, unlike Bixby who will only ever live in Galaxy devices. If you decide to go this route, and have no interest in Bixby Vision etc, you can long press on the home screen, swipe to the Bixby screen and flip the switch to hide Bixby until its ready. Switch button layout If you’ve always felt that Samsung had its navigation buttons in the wrong order, you’re far from alone. So far from alone that Samsung even finally decided to let you put them in normal Android order on the Galaxy S8. If you’ve been using Galaxy phones forever and think the way Samsung has always done it is the right way, then please move along, but if you’re itching to get things back in the right order, go to Settings > Display > Navigation bar > Button layout and choose Back – Home – Recents. Then sit back and feel the universe aligning somewhat. You made the right decision. Related: The case for capacitive buttons Samsung killing the physical home button is a big deal Disable animations Samsung’s software has gotten much faster over recent years but all Android phones can do with a little speed boost. Or in the absence of an actual speed boost, a simple trick to make your phone feel a little snappier. First you need to enable developer options. Go to Settings > About phone > Software information and tap on Build number seven times. Back up to the main Settings menu and you’ll see Developer options at the bottom. Scroll down until you see the options called Window animation scale and Transition animation scale. Turn both of these options off to get a snappier feeling phone (if you want to see what they do, put them at 10x and navigate around a little). Disabling animations is a simple trick to make your phone feel a little snappier. Maximize your screen space If you want to make the most of that luxurious Infinity Display, then you might want to take a leaf out of my book and shrink the on-screen contents a little to give it the feeling of being even larger. Fortunately, there’s a raft of options that allow you to achieve this quickly and easily, without any of the fiddly tweaks it used to require. First up, go to Settings > Display > Screen zoom and font and slide the sliders around to get the icon and text size the way you like. Just remember to hit Apply each time before backing out to see how it looks. You can also change the layout of app icons on your home screen and in the app drawer, allowing you to further change the sense of space. Full screen apps The Galaxy S8 comes with a fancy 18.5:9 aspect ratio that means a lot of your apps won’t be designed to fit from the get go. App developers will be scrambling to adapt their apps to a phone as important as the S8 – and Google is encouraging them to do so too – but in the meantime you can simply tell your S8 to force all your apps into the new aspect ratio. Just go to Settings > Display > Full screen apps and flip the switch for all the apps on your phone. There’s no need to do so for Samsung’s apps as they’re already optimized for the display and most of Google’s bundled apps are enabled by default, but you’ll need to flip the switch individually for any apps you install after taking the phone out of the box. The bundled AKG earbuds in the Galaxy S8 box, worth $99 separately, are actually really good. Actually use the AKG headphones If you’re anything like me, you have headphones of varying sizes and quality all around the house and you probably just leave the ones in the box a new smartphone came in until you lose the pair you’re currently using. Don’t do that this time. The bundled AKG earbuds in the Galaxy S8 box, worth $99 separately, are actually really good. Not really good when compared to a $250 pair of Sennheisers, but absolutely awesome for a free pair in the box. So ditch those old grubby iPod earphones you’ve been clinging onto for years and put these bad boys in your ears instead. They’ll thank you for it. Set up the blue light filter From making your ears happy to your eyes, blue light filters have become standard fare for a lot of newer smartphones. Cutting out blue light, especially after dark, can help you get to sleep easier. The only thing is you have to actually take a moment to set it up. Doing so is quite easy though: you can either choose to have it automatically come on between sunset and sunrise, turn it on manually (also an option in the Quick Settings) or you can set a custom schedule if you’d prefer to blast your brain with blue light a little later in the night than dinner time. Go to Settings > Display > Blue light filter and play around. Cutting out blue light, especially after dark, can help you get to sleep easier. Delete bloat Samsung’s pre-installed app situation has improved dramatically over the years, but there’s still a few apps on your Galaxy S8 you will either never use or simply don’t want. Fortunately, you can remove most of these. For those you can’t uninstall completely, you can disable them so they don’t run in the background, even if you won’t be able to recoup that storage space. Just open the app drawer and long press on an app icon (this also works on the home screen). You’ll see a shortcut menu like Android’s launcher shortcuts. One of the options near the bottom will either be Uninstall, Disable or a grayed-out Disable. Uninstall those you can, disable those you can’t and make your peace with the ones you have no control over. Unfortunately for those of you with a carrier-branded S8 you’ll have fewer options to delete bloatware than international unlocked owners. Sorry about that. Enable scanner gestures In case you didn’t know, some newer smartphones allow you to drag down the notifications shade by swiping down on the fingerprint scanner. This is a handy trick to have up your sleeve if you’re using your phone one handed or aren’t excited about the hand gymnastics required to shimmy up to the top of the phone, specially on one as tall and slippery as the S8. Go to Settings > Advanced features > Finger sensor gestures and flip the switch to on. Now you can swipe down and up on the scanner (if you can reach it) to drag down or pull up the notifications shade. Related:  The pros and cons of finger scanner gestures Synaptics’ new scanner has force recognition and swipe gestures Change quick settings tile size As you may have guessed from a few entries above, I like to maximize the sense of space on my phone. The Galaxy S8 has another nice built-in option that lets you squeeze a little more info on screen. Just pull down the Quick Settings panel from the top of the screen, either with a two-finger swipe or two single finger swipes, and tap the overflow menu in the top right hand corner (the three vertical dots). Tap Button grid and choose the one you prefer. You can make the toggles larger or smaller, but if you go smaller, in a 5×3 grid (as I recommend) you’ll be able to get almost all of your Quick Settings tiles on the one screen. Hit the overflow menu again and tap Button order to drag the toggles around. This lets you put the most important ones for you on the first screen, negating the need to swipe to the second panel. Bonus mention As you no doubt have heard, the Galaxy S8 ships with its QHD+ screen set to FullHD+ resolution. This was presumably set as the default option to eke out additional battery life and to be fair, most people probably wouldn’t even notice it’s not 2K. But, if you want the very best out of your Galaxy S8 – especially if you’re picking up a Gear VR to go with it – then you’ll want to bump that default resolution up to the full QHD+. Go to Settings > Display > Screen resolution and drag that slider over to the far right. Note that this will consume more battery life, so if you don’t notice a significant benefit, perhaps consider dropping it back to FullHD+ or even HD+ when battery life is important.

Mattel announced a new line of Barbie dolls on Thursday. The new dolls come in tall, petite and curvy. The Barbie doll seen here is Mattel's petite Barbie doll. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Mattel may have a new CEO that used to work for Google. But the floundering toymaker still has a huge problem. Fewer kids want to play with the company's Barbie and American Girl dolls, Fisher-Price toys and Mega Bloks. Mattel stock plunged 11% Friday -- to their lowest level since October 2015. The company announced Thursday that its latest results missed forecasts. Sales plunged 15% in the quarter and Mattel reported a bigger than expected loss. The stock was the worst performer in the S&P 500 on Friday. CEO Margo Georgiadis, who left her job as president of Google's Americas division in January to take over at Mattel, said in the earnings release that the results were worse than expected due to "the retail inventory overhang" after the holidays. In other words, parents didn't buy their kids more new toys after splurging on them in December. But Mattel has been struggling for some time now. That's one of the reasons that Georgiadis succeeded Christopher Sinclair as CEO, in the first place. (Sinclair is now executive chairman.) Simply put, Mattel doesn't have the toys that kids want. Barbie sales plunged 13%. American Girl sales were down 12%. And the company's Construction and Arts & Crafts unit, which includes Lego competitor Mega Bloks, plummeted 38%. And it's not just a matter of children abandoning traditional dolls, action figures and board games in favor of smartphones, tablets, video games and other technology. Mattel rival Hasbro, which has licenses tied to Disney's Star Wars franchise, and also recently took over the Disney Princess line of toys from Mattel, has been on fire lately. Shares of Hasbro are up nearly 25% so far in 2017 and more than 75% over the past three years. Mattel's stock has plunged nearly 20% already in 2017 and is down more than 40% since early 2014. Hasbro's stock even rose slightly Friday, a sign Wall Street believes Mattel's problems are company specific and not a broader indicator of weak consumer spending overall. Hasbro will report its latest results before the market opens Monday. Wall Street is expecting that sales and earnings were flat in the first quarter, which is typically not a big one for toy companies. So will Georgiadis, who in addition to Google has also worked for Groupon, credit card company Discover and consulting company McKinsey & Company, be able to turn Mattel around? She is a veteran exec, but lacks toy industry experience. She noted in the earnings release that sales in China and other parts of Asia were strong. She also expressed hope that toys tied to another upcoming Disney movie -- Pixar's Cars 3 -- will help boost sales in the coming quarters for its Hot Wheels brand. But the pressure is on Georgiadis to quickly prove to kids, parents and investors that Mattel will be able to revitalize some of its classic brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price and also launch new hit toys as well. Otherwise, the stock will continue to languish in Wall Street's equivalent of the Island of Misfit Toys. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

You are free to develop an app for Android and publish it to the Play Store with just a few basic restrictions. This has led to a plethora of really cool Android apps, some of which aren’t available on iOS or other platforms. Running Android apps usually requires an Android smartphone or tablet — obviously! — but what if you currently use iOS and want to try Android without actually getting an Android device? Fortunately, with a little leg work, you can run Android apps on a regular old Windows PC. There are a few different ways to go about it, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Android Studio One popular way to get Android apps running on a PC is to go through the Android emulator released by Google as part of the official Android Studio. The emulator can be used to create virtual devices running any version of Android you want with different resolutions and hardware configurations. The first downside of this process is the somewhat complicated setup process. You’ll need to grab the installer from Google’s site and run through the setup process to download the platforms you want — probably whatever the most recent version of Android happens to be at the time (7.1 at the time of publishing). Google has some pre-configured emulation options available in the menu for Nexus/Pixel devices, but you can set the parameters manually, too. Once you’ve booted your virtual device, you’ll need to get apps installed, but the emulator is the bone stock open source version of Android — no Google apps included. Since there’s no Play Store, you need to do some file management. Take the APK you want to install (be it Google’s app package or something else) and drop the file into the tools folder in your SDK directory. Then use the command prompt while your AVD is running to enter (in that directory) adb install filename.apk. The app should be added to the app list of your virtual device. The big upside here is that the emulator is unmodified Android right from the source. The way apps render in the emulator will be the same as they render on devices, and almost everything should run. It’s great for testing app builds before loading them onto test devices. The biggest problem is that the emulator is sluggish enough that you won’t want to make a habit of running apps in it. Games are really out of the question as well. BlueStacks App Player If you’re looking to get multiple apps and games up and running on your computer with the minimum of effort, BlueStacks is your friend. The BlueStacks App Player presents itself as just a way to get apps working, but it actually runs a full (heavily modified) version of Android behind the scenes. Not only that, but it has the Play Store built-in, so you have instant access to all of your purchased content. It actually adds an entry to your Google Play device list, masquerading as an Android device. The BlueStacks client will load up in a desktop window with different app categories like games, social, and so on. Clicking on an app or searching does something unexpected — it brings up the full Play Store client as rendered on tablets. You can actually navigate around in this interface just as you would on a real Android device, which makes it clear there’s a lot more to BlueStacks than the “App Player” front end. In fact, you can install a third-party launcher like Nova or Apex from the Play Store and set it as the default. The main screen in BlueStacks with the app categories is just a custom home screen, so replacing it makes BlueStacks feel almost like a regular Android device. Bluestacks playing Lumino City. Having full Play Store access means you won’t be messing around with sideloading apps, and BlueStacks manages to run apps pretty well. Most games are playable, but keep in mind you’ll have trouble operating many of them with a mouse. If your PC has a touch screen, you can still use apps and games that rely on more than one touch input. BlueStacks can essentially make a Windows tablet PC into a part-time Android tablet. BlueStacks calls the technology that makes this possible “LayerCake” because Android apps run in a layer on top of Windows. The only real issue with BlueStacks is that it’s not running a standard Android build. All the alterations the company made to get apps working on a PC can cause issues — some apps fail to run or crash unexpectedly. This customized environment is also of little value as a development tool because there’s no guarantee things will render the same on BlueStacks as they might on a real Android device without all the back-end modifications. It’s also a freemium service with a $2 pro subscription, or you can install a few sponsored apps. Android PC ports If you don’t mind a little extra hassle, you can have a more fluid Android app experience by installing a modified version of the OS on your PC. There are a few ports of Android that will run on desktop PCs, but not all systems will be able to run them properly. The two leading choices for a full Android installation on PC are the Android-x86 Project  and Remix OS (pictured above), which is based on x86. There’s also an “app player” version of Remix that runs within Windows, but I’ve found it to be extremely temperamental. Neither one is in a perfect state, but Remix OS is a little more fleshed out. Remix requires at least 2GB of RAM and a 2GHz dual-core processor, but practically you’ll need more than that for good performance. The UI is not stock Android — it’s based on the x86 project code, but has been modified for a more desktop-like experience. That might actually be preferable, though. You could install either over top of Windows, but that’s not the best idea. The smarter way would be to create a separate hard drive partition and install Android there. The Remix installer will help you do that. If you don’t want to install Android on your PC, you can try running one of these operating systems in VirtualBox, which should be a little faster than the official Android emulator. It probably still won’t be good enough for games, but most apps should install and run correctly (BlueStacks is faster at this). There’s no Google Play integration when you install Android ports, but sideloading Play Services is fairly simple with Remix. So what’s the best way? If you need to test something with the intention of putting it on other Android devices, the emulator is still the best way. This is best suited to developers as the configuration and management of apps is complicated. It’s slow, but you’ll be able to see how things will work on the real deal. The Android PC ports are definitely fun to play with, and performance is solid when you get apps running, but they can be finicky. If you’re interested in getting more than a handful of apps running on your PC so you can actually use and enjoy them, BlueStacks App Player is the best solution. It’s fast, has Play Store access, and works on multitouch Windows devices. I think it’s still the best of the “app players” for Windows. If you actually want to use Android apps long-term on your PC, you might want to consider installing Remix OS. It’ll take time to get it working, but it’s a full Android-based OS for your PC.

Article recycling? Oo http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony It was a full re-write of a previous story, to bring it up to date (and to make it useful again!) eonvee375 cool ^^ makes you realize android is more than 5years old now (around 2008?) CPPCrispy Android on Windows is old news. What we need is someone to natively support Android apps in Linux (this means no VMs). If that happens then I think we may have Linus’ dream of “The Year of the Linux Desktop”. David Onter Nexus 9 *cough* Android L *cough* NVIDIA K1 64bit *cough* massau i think we better wait for some hard data and compare it to other chip makes. robthom Apparently that was 4 years ago. I think the article has been updated or something. David Onter Maybe he’s still waiting ^^ Kat You alive fgt? David Onter Sure am, ask your mom about last night Kat I understand you haven’t passed third grade. No need to make it clear with your petty “insults”. David Onter That’s actually right, I’m currently in the third class of a higher technical engineering school. The school year isn’t over yet so it’s impossible to already have passed. We can continue this chat but first, just one question; who are you exactly and why did you start this convo? Have I already talked to you in the past or are you just a troll? Phillip Ramirez not all apps will work right. IE whisper and other apps of that type. lm_a_dope I have always thought desktop Linux like Ubuntu should work on android app integration.

Here’s a no-root version! alldownloadapk.com/download-debian-noroot-15-10-21-apk/ What else do you mention nowadays that people call you an idiot for :) techrichey Hi Ryan you should update your post as a new emulator changed the android development a lot faster than ever just check Genymotion Phil Gibbs Android on a PC-Far faster than native emulator is GenyMotion. Most Android app developers use it as a plug-in for Eclipse or Android Studio. deej The biggest problem (besides stability) with BlueStacks is that it is based on an ancient version of Android. Version 2.2 hasn’t been current for several years now. Dozerman I’m still wanting someone to compile Dalvik/ ART for x86 Linux for native app running. http://www.tohodo.com/ Tom Just installed BlueStacks on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine. It doesn’t seem to be working, as I’m able to open the Play store but not able to install anything (it hangs at downloading or installing state). This needs more time in the oven. pixelstuff I was wondering just last week about how hard it might be for VirtualBox to emulate an Arm processor. Surely a modern i7 processor could easily run it as fast as the chips found in even the newest phones. That seems like it would be extremely useful if so.

Thanks for Sharing your information, keep it up. this site is also very helpful Android apps for pc Shane 2WISH I use this and you have a five min window then it crashes/freezes they offer it glitch free if you pay 24$ a year lol really… Johnny The issue with Bluestacks currently, is that in order to keep using it for some of your apps, you have to download apps of the day, & play it in order to unlock bluestacks for the day. Hopefully, a better option will be released, b/c to me being forced to download an app, just to unlock some software is as bad as having to fill out a survey to download a file (which is a complete identity theft scam btw). Kerem Atalay I recommend Amidous. A much better alternative. http://www.getappsonpc.com/ RAMEEZ MALIK Well according to me Bluestacks is the best way to run the apps and games on PC if you are not a geek and want some simplicity.Else you can explore a whole lot universe for that Omari Jalagania try this method https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjJ3KWz2J6s kasra how to download?????

McClary In my experience the best way to run Android on a PC is installing Android x86. I installed to a speedy USB 3.0 flash drive and it runs very well. No lag. The second best method IMO is Genymotion 1.3. It is outdated, but Jellybean and you have full access to the Playstore like in x86. Mikael Murstam I develop on a galaxy tab S.

BananaFace Narwhal so wifi apps don’t work? Nowhere Girl I simply don’t want to have a smartphone at all. My computer and my extremely outdated mobile (one that doesn’t even have a color screen) are enough for me. I like having different devices than everybody else is using (hence my old-fashioned mobile phone) and smartphones are not for me – they are difficult to use in cold temperatures (not that I live in a VERY cold climate, but this is Central Europe, we do have real winters here), plus, if I’m right, you can’t use a touchscreen while wearing gloves – and because of my allergy I always go outside in nice black cotton gloves; sometimes, when skin on my hands itches really bad, I also wear clean cotton gloves at home. http://wixoz.com/ Zafar Ali thanks. visit wixoz.com videos website Harpreet follow thise link for download adroid emulators fpr window http://techapple.net/2014/12/top-7-free-android-emulators-windows-788-110-pccomputer-run-android-appsgames-windows-78-110/ ok use for android for pc http://mdmasudhosen.blogspot.com Md.

I do not permit and never would that my pc would turn on wile I am not there WTF is wrong with this Windows heads!?? I know (Presume) they are already all NSA FBI etc…but this is way to much!!! YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TURN MY PC ON WHILE I AM NOT NEAR IT PERIOD!!! Where is the app for it? I disabled all wakeUp timers, updates and all possible maintenance services but the damn windows is still turning my pc on by it self (Log: Wakeup source: Unknown)! How about app for last?! bob Johnson Disable Wake from magic packet in your ethernet card device manager. Also turn off windows update wake up. I am having the same issue. eonvee375 bitcoin miner? w/ amd gpu? (just guesses) Mikael Murstam Sounds like a Wake on LAN setting. Isidwros Gru Ghosts ? zaxthealien Disable Wake on LAN or Wake from magic packet (they’re the same thing). yes, fck these “FEATURES” of Windows10. They think it’s a good idea to wake the PC up when the owner’s not there, They think it’s a great idea to restart my PC when I’m leaving it to render or encode something. They think it’s a genius idea to automatically run a 30mins update when I’m at a deadline and trying to start my PC. Marko Novak There is no wake up timer nor update service nor LAN wake up option activated! All disabled, The PC still turn on by it self and log shows source as Unknown! It even connects to the Wlan despite being set not to connect automatically! I never used a hack (Keygen etc.) all my programs are legit! I use Commode int. security with custom firewall and regularly cheeked pc! The problem is NSA FBI etc. that took over the damn MS that is what is the problem, now we are all like some test rabbits allowed to be pooled for the ears any time they like… Why else Gates leaved his “baby” why else the win 10 are free now. That is no fairytale taking over MS…. zaxthealien let’s just go back to Win7 and prepare our migration to Mac or Linux when MS no longer supports Win7. Marko Novak I am seriosly considering this option! The only problem is I have all new custom PC, half of components just released… zaxthealien damn lake series . . . can’t install Win7 easily on them . . . good luck! I will watch you suffer from the side! http://instagram.com/bjorndori Björn Dóri Björnsson This has nothing to do with the OS, it can’t wake up your PC unless it’s allowed through BIOS/UEFI… You can specify active hours when you don’t want your computer to automatically install updates. If you require to postpone them any longer you can easily do so via a command promt but try to limit accessing the internet in case there is an active exploit fixed by that update… Marko Novak Hey there pal, I spend days with this problem there is no idea/solution I would´t use! I even tried to trick it within setting the “don´t update/restart” clock from 24 to 24h. It even connects to the W-lan within disconnected and disabled “auto connect”. MS is going way to far this time! Mr. B Hello, I had this problem and I tried all the solutions but nothing worked. I went into Bios setting and loaded optimized defaults before save and reboot and no more problems. Artho Poda not a single app works with ARC Welder, piece of crap Andrew This has been available for a while! Download android studio and download an emulator. Now you can view and play with every single apk your heart desires! BillyBobJones Blue Stacks is a horrible bit of software that is nothing more then bloatware. I would not recommend anyone get bluestacks. Carlos Menaier What would you recommend then? I use bluestacks tu run whatsapp and I like that it updates automatically. It uses a lot of cpu, but arc welder and the emulator dont update the apps and I don’t even know if whatsapp work on them BillyBobJones To be completely honest. Buy a cheap crappy smart phone jail break it and put a custom rom on it. I take it you are using the home internet etc so just hook onto the wifi. The very first versions of bluestacks were good since it didnt have alot of bloat apps etc in it. WittyPixel why not just use bluestacks? Andres Sanchez MeMU android emulator is best for me. ITPalg isntal … http://downloadapkinstaller.com/ Natasha Bradford Though, I didn’t try Android apps on Windows OS, but however, I can comment that BlueStacks App Player is quite user-friendly as compared to ARC Welder for Chrome.

Image Credit: Mercedes-Benz All 2016 and 2017 Mercedes-Benz vehicles can now be controlled with Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant on Google Home, the carmaker announced today. To use Alexa or Google Assistant with a Mercedes-Benz car, owners must activate and create a subscription for Mbrace, Mercedes’ in-vehicle tech for entertainment, navigation, and remote controls. The voice controls being extended today come in the form of a Mercedes Me Google Assistant action and an Alexa skill by the same name. The new feature can be used to do things like lock doors remotely, find a nearby cafe, or start your engine by saying, “OK Google, tell Mercedes Me to start my car.”  Say “Alexa, ask Mercedes Me to send an address to the car” and the assistant will give you navigation directions. The Mercedes Me service on Google Home is currently only available in the United States. A Mercedes-Benz integration for Google Assistant was initially announced last December when the Actions on Google platform  was launched. Mercedes-Benz is the second most recent carmaker to bring voice control to their vehicles. Last week, Hyundai launched a long-anticipated Google Assistant conversation action to accomplish similar things as the Mercedes Me action for some vehicles made between 2015 and 2017. The Hyundai integration was initially announced during the Computer Electronics Shows (CES) in January. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

This is the start of a long-term partnership, meaning that moving forward all Samsung phones and tablets will have Google Music Play as the default.  There's a lot of competition in the music app market, with Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music and others all trying to win users over. Google has played a strong hand here – not only has it announced this partnership to coincide with the launch of one of the most hotly anticipated smartphones of the year, it has included some pretty enticing extras to sweeten the deal.  Users who've never tried Google Play Music before are eligible for a three-month free trial, giving them access to the 40-million song back catalogue at Google’s disposal. And as Google is YouTube’s parent company, a Google Play Music subscription includes access to YouTube Red, the ad-free version of YouTube.   What’s more, in order to ensure that users can transfer all of their current music collection over, Google is offering double the usual amount of cloud storage, for free – Samsung users will be able to upload 100,000 of their own tracks to Google Play’s cloud storage so that they can enjoy them anywhere. Bixby integration According to The Verge, this native integration means that when Samsung’s digital assistant Bixby launches later this year you'll be able to launch Google Music Play directly from Bixby, just by giving it a command to play a track.  This would be an improvement over Google's virtual assistant that's currently on the S8, where if you ask it to play you a track it asks you to select an application to use. Hopefully you'll still be able to choose a different app if you want, otherwise users who don't use Google Play Music will be stuck with Bixby pushing an app on them that they don't want. Speaking of different choices, if all of this isn’t for you, and you’d rather just have the basic Samsung music app, it is still available, and just needs to be downloaded from the Play Store.  Samsung Galaxy S8 review Related news Leak shows Microsoft’s plans for its Chromebook rivals Moto X (2017) release date, news and rumors Honor 9: what we want to see The best PS4 Pro games: push your console to its 4K HDR limits See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Add Multiple Google Accounts to Google Home By Eric Ravenscraft on April 21st, 2017 Google Home is designed to be a shared device that everyone in the house can use. Now, Google has finally made it possible for it to recognize different people and give personalized info to everyone using their Google accounts. Here’s how to set it up. Google Home’s multi-user feature is designed to work with as minimal fuss as possible. It uses voice training to learn what your voice sounds like. It can then give you custom information when you say things like “tell me about my day” or “what’s on my shopping list?” You can add up to six people to one Google Home, so everyone in your family can share a single device. To set it up, open the Google Home app and tap the devices icon in the top-right corner. Scroll to find your Google Home in the list of devices. Tap on the blue banner that reads “Multi-user is now available.” If you haven’t already, Google will start the process to learn how to recognize your voice. Make sure you’re in the same room as your Google Home and that it’s quiet so Google can record your voice. Google will ask you to say “Ok, Google” and “Hey, Google” a couple of times to learn your voice patterns. You can also retrain Google later, if you find that it’s not detecting your voice as well in the future. Once Google Home is done updating, you’ll see a sample list of commands you can use that will be customized based on who’s speaking. For example, you can say “Ok Google, what’s my name?” and Google will tell you who it thinks you are. This is a good command to try out when you add new users to make sure Google is identifying everyone in the house correctly. Tap Continue to move on. Once you’re done, Google will offer to invite others to do the same thing. Tap the blue Invite button and send a link to your family members or roommates with your communication app of choice. They’ll be asked to install the Google Home app and walk through the same steps you just did.   Ideally, this should mean that no one but you will be able to get information from your account unless they can mimic your voice. Though, I did confirm while testing that Google will recognize a recording of your voice to activate commands. Most of you probably won’t be that paranoid about your family trying to access information on your account, but it’s still worth knowing about. Google doesn’t allow Google Home to access a lot of private information that Google Assistant can access on other devices—like reading your email, reading reminders, or creating calendar events—for this exact reason. However, this is a start towards a more inclusive Google Home experience for the whole family. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Eric Ravenscraft covers smarthome tech for How-To Geek.

But the floundering toymaker still has a huge problem. Fewer kids want to play with the company’s Barbie and American Girl dolls, Fisher-Price toys and Mega Bloks. Mattel stock plunged 11% Friday — to their lowest level since October 2015. The company announced Thursday that its latest results missed forecasts. Sales plunged 15% in the quarter and Mattel reported a bigger than expected loss. The stock was the worst performer in the S&P 500 on Friday. CEO Margo Georgiadis, who left her job as president of Google’s Americas division in January to take over at Mattel, said in the earnings release that the results were worse than expected due to “the retail inventory overhang” after the holidays. In other words, parents didn’t buy their kids more new toys after splurging on them in December. But Mattel has been struggling for some time now. That’s one of the reasons that Georgiadis succeeded Christopher Sinclair as CEO, in the first place. (Sinclair is now executive chairman.) Simply put, Mattel doesn’t have the toys that kids want. Barbie sales plunged 13%. American Girl sales were down 12%. And the company’s Construction and Arts & Crafts unit, which includes Lego competitor Mega Bloks, plummeted 38%. And it’s not just a matter of children abandoning traditional dolls, action figures and board games in favor of smartphones, tablets, video games and other technology. Mattel rival Hasbro, which has licenses tied to Disney’s Star Wars franchise, and also recently took over the Disney Princess line of toys from Mattel, has been on fire lately. Shares of Hasbro are up nearly 25% so far in 2017 and more than 75% over the past three years. Mattel’s stock has plunged nearly 20% already in 2017 and is down more than 40% since early 2014. Hasbro’s stock even rose slightly Friday, a sign Wall Street believes Mattel’s problems are company specific and not a broader indicator of weak consumer spending overall. Hasbro will report its latest results before the market opens Monday. Wall Street is expecting that sales and earnings were flat in the first quarter, which is typically not a big one for toy companies. So will Georgiadis, who in addition to Google has also worked for Groupon, credit card company Discover and consulting company McKinsey & Company, be able to turn Mattel around? She is a veteran exec, but lacks toy industry experience. She noted in the earnings release that sales in China and other parts of Asia were strong. She also expressed hope that toys tied to another upcoming Disney movie — Pixar’s Cars 3 — will help boost sales in the coming quarters for its Hot Wheels brand. But the pressure is on Georgiadis to quickly prove to kids, parents and investors that Mattel will be able to revitalize some of its classic brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price and also launch new hit toys as well. Otherwise, the stock will continue to languish in Wall Street’s equivalent of the Island of Misfit Toys.

It's time to talk about Google, the Pixel phones, and feelings of abandonment David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/10/06 12:42pm PDTOct 6, 2016 155 Plus 1 on G+ 268 Share on Facebook 141 Share on Twitter Total Shares564 Editorials Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P First, I'd like to invite everyone to take a deep, calming breath. I mean that sincerely, not sarcastically: Google's Pixel phones have proven rather literally to be an emotional topic in the tech community over the last few days. In looking over Android Police's comments, the sentiment around these phones has been a veritable tidal wave of negativity - and not all of it is unwarranted. There are clear and legitimate reasons to find Google's new smartphones uncompelling as a consumer. But much of the anger, the frustration, the rage seems directed not at the Pixel phones themselves. And of that which is, is often through the lens of Nexus, not of the Pixel phones as products in their own right. The real negativity seems largely centered around Google's professed end of the Nexus line, what Pixel means for support of Nexus products, and a general feeling that Google is abandoning loyal and otherwise trusting fans. I use the word fans for a reason. Because as customers, Google hasn't really wronged anyone in any perceivable way. The Pixel phones being announced has no actual effect on the Nexus 5, 6, 5X or 6P. Your phone either will or will not get updated depending on its remaining software support window irrespective of Google's new smartphones. Its warranty, extended or otherwise, will continue to be honored. Customer support, too, remains intact. If Google had never announced the Pixel phones at all and simply took a year off building smartphones, what would be materially different about your experience as an owner of a Nexus phone? In reality, probably nothing of any significant consequence in the time you'd own the device. If you view the relationship between yourself as the owner of a Nexus smartphone and Google as the company selling and supporting that product, Google is broadly living up to the assurances it made as the vendor. Google is not taking anything away from you. But as a fan? As a fan, suddenly the conversation changes. "Google is not giving Nexus devices the features it gives its new Pixel phones." "Google is abandoning what made Nexus phones great." "Google doesn't care about Nexus owners anymore." "Google killed Nexus." While these statements are loaded with varying proportions of truth and hyperbole, I think even those of us who aren't feeling this way can at least understand where this sentiment comes from. It's reactionary, it's rigid, and it's sometimes palpably angry. And I think that, even for those who disagree with the way some people express these feelings, it is important to validate that those who are expressing them do actually feel this way. I don't believe that as a necessity people are simply looking for something to complain about or feel victimized by - I think there are those who feel truly aggrieved by what has transpired in the last few days. I also believe that, as is Internet Law, some of this is undoubtedly a result of misinformation, [sometimes willful] misunderstanding, and general confusion about what is and is not fact. And that this is on some level unavoidable. I can readily admit that sometimes I'm as guilty as anyone of being reactionary before having a full understanding of a situation - we're only human. So let's lay out what I think are the real issues that galvanized this discussion on October 4th. Google is, for the time being, out of the cheap smartphone business. The Pixel and Pixel XL run anywhere from $649 to $869, and quite possibly a lot more depending on where in the world you live. This is very expensive for all but a relatively small slice of the population. It's also what much of said population spends on an iPhone every two years, but that's neither here nor there. The issue is that many Nexus fans have counted on Google since 2012 to deliver an affordable smartphone with an unfettered Android. The Nexus 4, 5, and 5X and 6P filled these roles. 2014 was a bit of a gap year with the Nexus 6, though - and we saw similar discussions around the time that phone debuted in regard to price (it started at $649 in the US). But more interesting to me is that we also saw this become a very real issue last year with the Nexus 5X and 6P. If you live in the US, you may not have noticed, but around the world, the Nexus 5X and 6P were very, very expensive. In the EU, the diminutive Nexus 5X cost what amounted to around $600 when it came out. Sounds ludicrous, right? The Nexus 6P was generally closer to $800. Far from cheap. Europeans have it no better this year: the Pixel starts at the equivalent of $850 in Europe (759€) and go all the way up to over $1100 for the 128GB XL (1009€). Like in the US, these retail price points precisely mirror those of Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (which is no coincidence). There is absolutely every reason to contend that what amounts to over $850 is too expensive for a smartphone. I'm right there with you. I can even understand that there is a group of people out there who simply don't want to spend more than $400-500 on any smartphone, full stop. To you, I say, do what consumers do best: speak with your wallet! There is no better way to signal to a company that its product is undesirable than to not buy it. And this isn't a condemnation of critique - it's absolutely valid to complain about the fact that, holy cow, these aren't cheap phones. But let's separate what is a substantive argument - Google's pricing can be perceived as uncompetitive - and the idea that Google has ever owed anyone an affordable smartphone. I will be the first to say that I have no empathy for corporations. They're profit-making machines; they don't deserve you feeling bad for them. They aren't people (Citizens United jokes aside). But equally, there is no objective assertion to be made that Google has "betrayed" its customers by producing more expensive smartphones. Alternatives exist, even if they may not meet a subjective list of demands some consumers may have. The reality of consumer products is harsh, but Google upping its smartphone price point is hardly something worthy of incensed, expletive-laden tirades. On the scale of "awful things companies do to consumers," this pegs somewhere around "Whole Foods raised the price of kombucha" and "there's a longer wait on the Dell customer support line than usual." Whole Foods didn't promise you cheap fermented tea, and Dell didn't say you'd be speaking to a real human being within 5 minutes - if you had those expectations, you created them by virtue of past experience. If you don't like them, take your business somewhere else. This is not to defend Google's prices for its phones. I agree: they're expensive. But I don't think an MSRP is victimizing anyone. Google is giving Pixel smartphones software features that it is not giving Nexus phones (for now, and maybe some forever, but maybe not, it's not clear). Plain and simple, Google's Pixel phones will ship with software and features that current Nexus devices do not have. It remains unclear which of those features Nexus phones will get, when they will get them, and why they aren't getting some right now or ever. I understand this is frustrating - information without clarity always is. People are confused, and misinformation is starting to spread. (See: "Google doesn't care about Nexus phones anymore.") As you may remember, this isn't the first time this has happened. It also won't be the last - I guarantee it. This is how consumer technology products have worked for a very long time. And no, Nexus has never been immune to this. The Nexus 5 debuted with the Google Now Launcher exclusively for a number of months, before it was released onto the Play Store. Smart Burst was exclusive to the Nexus 6P. Hell, the entire Galaxy Nexus was exclusive to Verizon in the US for nearly half a year. Were any of these "exclusivity" decisions popular? Of course not! But it seems silly to act openly outraged that Google is doing something that has demonstrable historical precedent. Nor did Google ever promise, or even imply, that its Nexus devices would receive every single software feature that the devices which succeeded them would get. This is another expectation created by our own interpretations and experiences, not by anything that Google actually declared to be some sort of major product directive or marketing point. Supported Nexus phones will get Android 7.1. They will get quarterly maintenance release updates until, at least, the end of their support windows, and security patches beyond that. They may eventually get some features that are currently Pixel-exclusive. We don't know which ones. Yelling about it isn't going to make the situation any more clear, nor will it make anything happen faster, as I doubt even Google is completely certain which features it intends to back-port in yet. But because it seems to be such a point of conspiratorial contention right now: there is absolutely nothing to suggest Google is "abandoning" software support of existing Nexus devices. Zip. Zilch. Everything leading to this conclusion is inference, and a lot of it is, frankly, of a rather tin-foil hat quality. There is no reason to think anything has changed in regard to how Nexus phone software commitments are fulfilled. But what about Assistant? And Pixel Launcher? And Smart Storage? Or the new navigation buttons? I know. We all want clarity around this. The annoying part? We'll probably just have to be patient and wait and see what happens. That does suck. Anyway, this is already getting long-winded. I just want to wrap up by expressing my earnest request that we all try to keep discussion around the Pixels, the future of Nexus, and Android itself enjoyable. There's nothing wrong with negativity itself - we're all bound to interpret some things negatively some of the time (I should know, right?). But the hyperbole about Google as a company having committed some atrocity against loyal fans and customers is simply not supported. Google has, at worst, created confusion and uncertainty about a few rather specific issues and economically alienated some portion of individuals. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that spoonful of vinegar tastes like ice cream. What I will say is this: we'll all feel a little less raw about this in a couple of weeks if we just take a step back and breathe. Tags editorial opinion pixel pixel xl subscribe ...

Is this a record or something? abazigal I'd say. Even Apple-bashing pieces rarely exceed 200. Google's move has clearly touched a raw nerve. Shaun Smith Love this new breed of Android neg. How many of you underpaid for your Nexus 5 three years ago, and now believe that Google has stabbed you in the back because they "bit the hand that feeds them"? News flash: That was cheap grace given to us by Google because they didn't want their OS embarrassed every year by OEMs that can't keep their hands off of it. Every penny you saved on the 5, 5x, 6p was ate by Google. It's obvious that HTC, Samsung, LG, etc. are not interested in marketing a reasonably competitive device on their own (I'm not talking specs, I'm talking user experience) to challenge Apple. This is the best thing to happen to all of us, just put down the gun, breathe, and save and extra weeks worth of your allowance and by the damn thing. Y'all know you are. Real GenericUser This is the best thing to happen us? If by us you are referring to Android fans then you are delusional. The best thing that could have happened is that Google put out a phone that was amazing at this silly price point. There is already a company catering to isheep. Krill Siluroid Well, right after the hardware announcement event, I checked the Google store to see the specs and pics. About 5 minutes later, I received my pre-order confirmation in Gmail. It's a silver 128GB and I get the new headset with it. It's the same feeling when I got my Pixel C tablet earlier this year. Mobile tech is my weakness and drop more money on it than my wife would like. I just hope I am not disappointed with this new phone. Woopher What is this? Google damage control? I thought Google didn't care cuz it wasn't intended for us geeks. Now suddenly we should calm down and accept that the company we like have turned into some sort of copycat. Gimme a brake. I was going to buy this phone for whatever they were asking but with this design. Blah. Remember laughing at cheap iPhone copies manufactured by the Chinese when you saw them the pictures just a couple of years ago. These, these phones was what we were laughing at, only these are expensive. Designed by someone who have the nerves to call himself designer. After presentation I went to the store and bought 2 Nexus 6P (for me and my wife). Designed by the Chinese designers. Calm down? I don't think so. I'll probably point and laugh at anyone even considering buying this phone. Also please don't forget Google is not Apple. The fans here won't just bend over and ... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Fan is short for fanatic....just let that sink in. RayNeverLearns On the scale of "awful things companies do to consumers," this pegs somewhere around "Whole Foods raised the price of kombucha" and "there's a longer wait on the Dell customer support line than usual." -- You, Sir, are one of my favorite Editors, full stop. Real GenericUser If Whole Foods raised the price of kombucha to twelve hundred bucks a bottle or Dell decided a week per call was a decent response time, we would expect the brands to take serious hits in reputation. These phones are at least a six hundred dollar bottle of your favorite spoiled tea. So utterly not worth the price that there can be no avoiding the reputation hit. Cowboydroid The price is the only really deplorable aspect of this move. The program will fail if Google insists on premium pricing. They seem deaf to the market, one in which they helped create by previously offering their devices at affordable prices. Toys Samurai To people who think Google always made "cheap phones", please go look up the original Moto X. When it's launched, the 16Gb model was sold at $579.99 with much lower spec than comparable flagships at its time. Less than 1 year later, Google gave up its hardware effort and sold Motorola. So, no, I am not angry at Google because it stopped making cheap phones, or not taking care of loyal fans who bought a Nexus. I am angry at Google, because it never seems to understand what it wants to achieve, and never seems to be bothered by not sticking to its plan for a little bit longer after its loyal fans give them their hard-earned money. Marcelove And is official : AndroidPolice became the Android version of iVerge: defend at all costs the "parent company" even if there is no excuse for it (besides the advertising money). Waiting for the article/review of Pixel phones: "Why Pixel phones makes sense: a great new beggining from Google, improving everything you got in the past with the Nexus family. It is the future and you should and will embrace the new devices without regrets." Real GenericUser Word. gavinmcc13 I don't feel betrayed at all. This is exactly what many of us have wanted, a legitimate iPhone competitor....made by Google. The Nexus 6p I had on October 3 is still the same phone I have today. I anticipate that it will continue to receive updates monthly well beyond its useful life (useful to me anyway). Let's face it, we are upset that that Google didn't make a iPhone competitor that costs significantly less than an iPhone. That was always the "suck it apple" factor that drew me to my phone purchases in the past. So Nexus is out going forward, but that is the beauty of our OS.....choice. Wait a year until the price is more reasonable, or buy a new OnePlus every 6 months. There are several other solid choices to turn to, but alas they aren't a Nexus or Pixel are they? You know what they say about the times, "they are a changin". I don't think it's reasonable for us to require Google to be all things to all people. P.S., I want a pixel and will probably buy one....eventually Real GenericUser No. We are angry that Google didn't make an iPhone competitor in any meaningful sense. The hardware specs are abysmal. It sounds like you are saying you will buy one...when the price drops. spewak Watching Google go thru this charade and being wannabees? Priceless! Suzaku Kururugi $649 lmao ghostrider As an N5 owner for nearly 3 years, who really loves this handset, I was *hoping* that the Pixel phones would be a logical upgrade. Unfortunately, for me, like many, I've been put off for three main reasons; 1. Price 2. It looks almost exactly like an iPhone 3. A feeling of abandonment of the Nexus line I don't like the iPhone, I don't like the 'look' of the iPhone. It was almost exciting to see what the next Nexus phone would look like because they were made by different Google partners. Like many, I'm just feeling a bit let down. I can see what Google are trying to do with the Pixel line, but it just makes a lot of sense to me to keep the Nexus brand going at a cheaper price point. Even if they had ONE Nexus phone for 2017, that would have been something. A two tier range would give them price points to keep those who bought into Nexus happy. Sorry Google, just going for the premium end (attacking the iPhone in particular) you're going to lose a lot of customers who loved Nexus for what it stood for - good all round features and sensible pricing. moogle.nine I just retired my N5. It will be missed. Really happy I grabbed a 6p a few weeks ago though. I was ready for the next Nexus but decided before Pixel launch that I didn't like the direction things were going. I'll ride out the 6p (great phone by the way) until its battery dies and reevaluate then. Manohar $1000 for XL in India, i could but wont buy it as it just isnt a premium looking device, how can such a big company not know that the design matters. If you buy now and next year they get the design right then you will be the ultimate loser, while 6p will be a safe choice, the only issue i see in 6p is its size. Gobi Todic Well, to me there are three aspects to the new Google Hardware: 1. You now have to pay at least 650$ or more if you want to have smartphone that gets timely updates - at a time where more and more people use their smartphone as the main device, this is ridiculous. 2. There is no "vanilla Android" anymore - Samsung has its TouchWiz, HTC its Sense UI and Google has its Pixel-Stuff. On the one hand this isn't necessarily bad - it just shows that Android by itself has no feature. Only the different distributions are what count. On the other hand, this will make the fragmentation problem even worse. 3. Google burns its credibility big time with its move to not bring new features to Nexus products. To me there is no clear vision here what Google wants to be. The mess in regards to messenger apps, Google Assistant vs. Google now, Nexus vs. Pixel ... If you need to pay 650$ anyway, you can also choose the iPhone and will get updates directly from Apple regardless of your carrier and probably much longer than the Nexus/Pixel devices. Apple has a much better track record in that regard. As much as I admire Google for its advanced technology in terms of cloud systems and large scale IT systems - right now, Google seems to have lost focus. Victor QuyUy I'm just so so disappointed about the design of PiPhone that I wouldn't care to look for any other good points of it. Sorry for being that negative, but I just can't stand an iPhone running Android PS: for those who likes to defend for Pixel's design, please google the image of HTC One A9. Random! The article basically says "you're not entitled to anything, stop bitching", which's true. However, if you launch a product which gets your customers angry enough that you have to resort to this kind of "not entitled" attitude to justify your own fuckups, here's a tip: you're doing it very wrong. First and foremost, you should keep your customers happy - and Google's not doing that. Its strategy shows it's clearly aiming for a different audience now, which means the old audience is being ignored. They have all the right to be mad. Market adoption will show if Google did the right thing when reframing the target audience for its products, or if they shot themselves on the foot by ignoring their current audience. TBolt Honestly, @disqus_rm68P84K0T:disqus 's claim (above) that three of his iPhone friends are 'very interested' in the Pixel is NOT typical. I don't think Google will EVER grab any significant number of iPhone users. There are iPhones all around me -- not one of those iPhone owners wants to leave their precious, popular iPhone that "just works" with every iPhone around it. Random! There is a reason why some people are called iSheep and mocked by their dumbness, isn't it? They won't know better even if you rub better on their face. Still, this doesn't change the fact that Google is reframing their audience and targeting iPhone users. That's quite obvious and widely acknowledged. TBolt Right ... and I'm saying it's yet another Google initiative that's doomed to come up far short, if not fail outright. Real GenericUser Yep. And Google just announced to the world that what they really think is that their users are just as stupid. And those users are supposed to be cool with that. Sheepdroids the lot of us, as it were. Real GenericUser 100% agree. Apple ecosystem isn't coughing up any significant numbers of iPhone fans for anything less than spectacular. There isn't a single believable review out there calling these phones spectacular. Alex Murphy Google made a smart move here with the pricing and positioning of the Pixel. I'm been a Nexus guy for years, but with all honesty, the fanboy community is a tiny tiny part of the population, and Google is positioning this as a premium mainstream device. I've heard from THREE friends who have iPhones that they're very interested in switching to a Pixel, and they NEVER said that for a Nexus. Sometimes higher prices can actually sell more of a product because it's seen as 'exclusive' not 'affordable' and Google clearly wants to be in that premium, aspirational category, not the 'phone for everyone'. I think in the long run its a very smart move. Louis Hearn I look at it like this and its my view only. I have wanted a Iphone like device that runs android. This far beats the S7 to me and is in fact like the iPhone. I root most of my phones this might be the phone I leave as is ( for a while anyway depending on Dirty Unicorn). The camera is great from what I hear. So what if the battery is not removable it hasn't been in 3 generations or more and most of the quality phone don't have this option. Plus 15 min can give you 7 hours again wow. Who cares if it doesn't have a SD card. My Nexus 6 and 6P didn't either. The water resistant would have been nice but that isn't a problem for me either. It has the latest chip set. The 821 is great for many things. The stabilization of the camera is driven by the 821 and the gyroscope it seem to do good on the V10. It seems to work better. I have been a little shaken by the price but it has been going up and its really not that much more than the 6P was to me. The 32gb is fine with me. Google is given you there cloud to store videos and pictures at full resolution can you say wow again. After that what do you need that space for it just wont be needed. I use google music I have 20 gig on it and everything else is on my computer if I want it to change them or add a artist. I'm not normal on the phones I use either but I was thinking about the OnePlus 3. After I actually got my hands on one only to look I couldn't take any pictures but i played with it. There is no way i'm getting the lessor phone. I just might have to wait awhile maybe December 1. That really sucks to me because everybody who get it pre-order gets a daydream headset for free another $80 dollars. The assistant i'm really not sure of yet. I use allo which is the assistant I barely use now getting to understand it to use. I can't wait it is what we as enthusiasts have wanted to me. A device using my software not IOS and the quality is the same or better depends on who you asked. It hard for Apple heads to admit it, but its true . Wait till you touch it, feel it, and use it. P.S. teniff there are probably lots of things you don't know about the 6P phone as the same with me. If you don't use it for that purpose why would you know it. There are still things I'm learning about my Nexus 6P, and I'm sure your not a Idiot nor am I. I like to go to Youtube and look at tips and tricks.See other who use it give you ideas there are great people that just think differently. Definity inspiring to see. I only learned about that 4 months ago. I bought my 6P last December. Great Phone though. Soon to be a Ex-Nexus user and a Pixel user. Really its just a Name change to me. It still Goolge to me. Thartist I read the entire article too. Missing spec isn't quit true. It is a new chipset but the specs are there and there are many phones out there to purchase. Oneplus 3, ASUS is coming out with the 821. There is also the Apple iPhone. Something tell me me you compare Apples to Apples and not Apple to oranges or Grape fruits like most techies do to sound smart or educated. I test 10 to 12 phone a year. There are good phones for everyone just as there needs might be different. Don't be a hater. This is just Phone as a Superior tech head once said. I bet you know who said that. I would have mentioned the water proof aspect that I do wish it would have had built in. Ray Wylie Hubbub I will wait until the prices for used drop to a reasonable threshold. My N6 will be good for several more years. chris I like the pixels but I'll wait to see what the pixel 2 brings. It's a good attempt for the crown but i'd rather keep my s7 edge :) I don't want to be an early adopter. This is their first strike, I'll wait for the public reaction and google's ajustment. After what just happend to nexus owners i can't trust what Google says. Plus the news, verizon Will manage pixels updates. The phone just Lost all it's value. Google seems to adopter Samsung marketing plan with the pre order. I think they'll cut the Price in 3 or 4 months. That's my prédiction. Jonnyw2k Just want to add, people look at EU pricing and forget to add VAT (Similar to"local sales tax" ) which is around 20% (Lowest is 17% in Luxembourg with highest being 27% in Hungary) Which puts its pricing closer to $700 for 32GB X upto $940 for the 128GB XL. Which seems fairer as google needs to price its products at a place where if there is a fluctuation in exchange rate they don't end up selling the products in EU for "less" than their dollar value. joexzy Dave, The entire article reads as if you're trying convince yourself not to get your panties in a bunch, which you already did. TBolt I see some reasonable thought in the article. But, Google's burn **feels** real. I have put up with a lot by sticking with Google & Android as they flounder repeatedly with apps and services. I'll remember the burn when I buy my next phone. I see myself using Google Home in the future -- and an iPhone. And, I've lost the energy to promote, or defend, Google when conversations require it. Nizar Noor Google is cleaning up Android's image from cheapskates, it seems. Michael Rousseau Google is having a serious Branding problem. Alex Boreham It is kind of annoying for me, though. I got my first Nexus, the 6P only a few months ago, and planned to end up getting others in the future. I'm an Android purist, so I don't like skins. All I can do now I guess is flash AOSP or something like that after getting a new phone in about 2 years. Ittiam Not missing Nexus since now we have Motorola phones. Almost stock Android, quick updates and available across price ranges Felix Quick updates xDDDD Please inform us when you get 7.1 or even 7.0. Except you have a Moto Z/Moto Z Force you won't get Nougat this year. Sim Lash The Google Now Launcher was exclusive to the Nexus 5? http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/11/13/how-to-try-the-google-experience-launcher-with-translucent-bars-and-google-now-once-you-get-your-kitkat-update-apk-download/ Maybe only to people who couldn't flash or sideload it. Android wouldn't be much of anything if it wasn't for all of the developers on XDA and elsewhere, and if Cyanogen, Paranoid et al would get their stuff together, then Google's mishandling of Android wouldn't bother us as much. I'm sure we'll be seeing a Google Assistant zip file real soon, and it'll be part of ROMs in the near future. Stay Dirty. Patrick Hoffmann If you think it's too expensive. Just wait half a year, then it will be available for 300$ like every Samsung flagship :) The Calm Critic Nope it's still gonna be at least between $600 - $700 internationally, unlocked and off contract. Yes I'm talking about on average for most Samsung flagships. Outside of NA market, those don't really drop off on prices that much and fast in reality. Real GenericUser This entire article is a pure apologist nonsense. There is nothing in the pixels that justifies the price. The betrayal isn't that Google is selling a phone that literally no one is writing is actually worth the price. The betrayal is that Google showed up to battle heavyweights while weighing all of a buck twenty-five. These phones are not worth HALF the price being charged. Thus, we are asked to pretend that this act doesn't force people to reevaluate Google. Try this: Google customers value VALUE. It makes many of us disgusted to see Google announce so loudly that they believe that they can sell crap and people will snap it up just because they said you should buy. There's already a cell phone manufacturer like that. It isn't that the phone is a bad knock off of an iPhone. It is that Google is making itself a bad knockoff of Apple. A $900 phone should have been a $900 phone, not a $550 phone with an extra large price tag. Swinefuzz IMO Google's mistake here is hoping that Android users are like Apple users: insecure tech enthusiasts looking for a family/cult to belong to, hoping to achieve a (false) sense of being SPECIAL. I am not one of those sheeple. After waiting months, ready to $pend hundred$ on a practical and pure Android Nexus phone, the bloated Pixels are a major disappointment. I have no interest in VR/AR or the digital Assistant/SPY or silly exclusive OS features or paying too much to feel "elite". FinderKeeper *makes plans to buy Nexus 6P when it becomes last-gen* (currently using an Alcatel with Lollipop) ;-) kittyhelpdesk Google's company culture is one of abandonment. They're great at developing products but absolutely horrible at supporting them and creating better iterations of existing designs. As a company, we hesitate to ever depend on a Google hardware or software product because we've been burned so many times by them. The Calm Critic A buddy of mine summed this up really really well:- 1. An iPhone are built from the ground up with the key ingredient = SoC for it to be completely in tandem with iOS. As much as we'd like to avoid it, let's face it Apple's A chips are still arguably the world's best performing "not for sale to other OEMs" mobile SoC against its opposite category again and again until now. 2. Apple already have the global physical presence via selected carriers/telcos and appointed official resellers with the necessary after sales service points. Where's Google's? 3. Hate to say it but...resale value. 4. But after all has been said and done, the Apple tax is still a ridiculous cost of entry into a fairly limited OS and ultimately also getting into Apple's closed environment. So if people are finding it hard to justify paying that much for an Apple golden ticket sliced or diced, why the hell should any Android users (Nexus diehards especially) deal with a Google tax placed on top of a phone that's just basically a glorified spec sheet that HTC proceeded to build? Added salt to the wound when Google casually said AFTER Pixel's announcement that there's actually a custom chip planned laters? No really they wanna charge people this much for a so called Google styled iPhone killer when in fact the real deal is gonna come AFTERWARDS??? Must a helluva post Pixel day after party clearly.... jcn2u What this also does is raise questions of longevity for future/current products including Pixel et all. Point being Cell phones are approaching commodity status. How long before third party devices stop getting updates? Competition is great...unless one company holds all the "cards". Nothing good comes from a monopoly and it takes years to dismantle. Open source is a joke, a bad joke at that.

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 26 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares101 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! TheScientists I'm kind of amazed someone hasn't already done this. It's the most basic of necessary functionality in an 'assistant'. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ So after posting this yesterday I looked into it, and sadly there's still no official API for creating reminders, and surprisingly no one has made an unofficial one either. So then I extracted the Inbox APK and decompiled it, I'm working my way through the code to see if I can't start pinning something down, but I'm betting they'll release actual support before I manage to do that. TheScientists Kudos to you, sir. I would have thought there would be something of note in the Google app apk? Or maybe some 1/2-assed way to do it via IFTTT. And, no, I wouldn't take that bet. Google is in no rush to do anything. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The problem is that the decompiled source doesn't exactly come across in a way that makes perfect sense. If a Java class isn't named in the manifest, it ends up getting somewhat obfuscated by proguard, so instead of seeing something like ReminderBuilder I end up with something named C12345, and even the classes are built in such a way that an object ends up being built up through multiple classes instead of just in a singular method, so it's complicated. I did look into IFTTT as well yesterday hoping for a quick solution but was disappointed. We'll see how far I get before either finding some options or just giving up out of frustration. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. dcdttu Once you can distinguish between users isn't all you need for reading/writing appointments....you've got to actually code that process, too. That's likely what they're doing now. So far in my testing at my house, it's quite good at knowing the different voices in our household. I wouldn't see their lack of confidence being a problem, honestly, because before the multi-user features were enabled, you could get personal information off Google Home for one user. Adding more than one user, even if it's giving the info to the wrong person, doesn't seem to be any worse. pfmiller My assumption was that they already have the code for writing data to their services since it's already done in every other application. That part of the problem isn't exactly novel. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that. Crystalatracy Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

I'm more excited to find out how they intend to handle messaging, though. surethom I'm sorry but why can Google not do the most simplest things. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! Jimjames Esson Well said,, Google to me ,if i have a Rheumotolgy appointment i simply use Google Calendar..!! Easy peasy lemon sqeasy..lol Blake What's an SRE? Petr Faitl I highly suspect that the answer is a highly political. No doubt it's product managers who can't agree with privacy gurus to prevent a few pranksters (i.e. one's kids) adding events to your calendar. abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Lars Jeppesen Who cares mustbepbs I do, because when I want to add a few minutes to a kitchen timer, I have to cancel the current one and create a new one with the new time. Kitchen timers from fuckin Dollar General have this "feature". abc He does. As he just said. Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. Ryan Music, pairing it with Smartthings to be a home controller, etc. I USED to use it for my shopping list, which was great. But they broke that function just recently. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. Lars Jeppesen I love mine - I'm sorry you can't figure out why it could be useful. Ryan I got mine on discount, so that helped. But I use it as a voice control for my smart-home features and to play music. JG What about Hangouts? I'm assuming since you said it can't yet write to the account, could it at least read my incoming Hangouts to me? davidofmidnight never forget... A re-review of Google Home, 7 months in. pic.twitter.com/N5bHZg2iTk— Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) March 20, 2017 trickytree1984 Support for exchange calendars is just as important. Most of the world don't use one personal Google calendar for their work and home life Navarr Barnier I'm assuming that MU was a blocker ticket, and they just pushed it out as quickly as they could - so reminders and appointments would be a WIP now that the blocker is out of the way. Surely.. right? right? Jonathan Sorry, but I just don't care about not having this feature, and I don't think many average users do either. But it wouldn't be a post about the Home if AP didn't gripe about it! Ryan Id use it daily, just like how I used the shopping list daily. Its a pretty basic feature that most people use (which is apparently by the unlimited competing choices for calendar and todo apps). Jonathan I agree that it's a basic feature that seems simple enough to execute and should have been implemented from the start​. I just don't think that many people are clamoring for it in their Bluetooth speaker outside of the AP sphere. And it's just getting silly and petty that the AP writers mention it in 95% of the articles they write​ about it. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The Home isn't just some Bluetooth speaker. It's SUPPOSED to be an assistive device that currently doesn't do the most basic tasks. I set reminders constantly across my phone, my watch, and in my car. It drives me crazy that I still can't do this on what is marketed as being the flagship device for Google Assistant. Ryan Or place items in Keep, like it used to be able to do. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I would love to be able to add items to ANY list in Keep. When my wife and I organize parties we use shared lists in Keep and it would be great to just add things as we talk about them. Stephen Cunningham I cant' get over Google taking the shopping list out of Keep. They are walking backwards not forward. I was hoping you would be able to add to any Keep list or add a note to Keep. Mike Jones i would like to add calendar appointments and i would like to add another minute to a timer too but that doesn't kill Home for me. i have a lot of home automation and i get a ton of use out of that. i just had a scare the other night where i thought i heard something in my house right as i was getting into bed. "google turn on the lights" and my house lit up like daytime.... it made it simple to check out the house.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Apr 21, 2017, 12:40pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Mercedes-Benz announced today that all of its 2016 and 2017 vehicles in the US can now connect with both Amazon and Google’s digital voice assistants. Starting today, Mercedes owners can instruct their Google Home or Amazon Echo to remotely start or lock their vehicles, as well as send addresses to their in-car navigation system. But a promo video by Mercedes shows a much more frightening use-case: using these digital voice assistants to compensate for incredibly stupid behavior, like leaving the house with both the iron and stovetops on at full blast. “We want to offer our customers a broad range of services 24/7, not just when they are in our cars,” says Nils Schanz, head of Mercedes-Benz North America’s Internet of Things and Wearable Integration (how’s that for a title). “Mercedes-Benz’s goal is creating an intelligent ecosystem around cars and developing cutting-edge technology to make everyday life more convenient for our customers.” Using your Echo and Google Home in conjunction with your Mercedes will involve more verbal gymnastics than if you were just using the smart home devices on their own. Let’s let Mercedes explain: For instance, customers with Google devices can simply say, “Ok, Google, tell Mercedes me to start my car,” and it will remotely start the customer’s car. Another available feature includes remote lock. With Alexa devices, customers can say, “Alexa, ask Mercedes me to send an address to the car” for remote navigation input and point-of-interest requests. There will be some app integration gymnastics as well. Mercedes-Benz customers will need an active Mercedes me account and an active mbrace subscription. In order to link their accounts, customers will have to download the Google Home or Amazon Alexa app and connect it with Mercedes me. It doesn’t appear that Mercedes-Benz owners will be able to use Alexa or Google Home from inside their vehicles, but rather will use Mercedes’ in-car system to control those devices. Mercedes isn’t the first automaker to recognize the potential of third party digital voice assistants. At CES earlier this year, Ford unveiled its plan to roll out Alexa-equipped vehicles. Around the same time, Hyundai announced a new partnership with Google to add voice control through the Google Home. But Mercedes has certainly been at the forefront of smart home integrations. Three years ago, the Daimler-owned car company said it would be adding Nest support to its vehicles, meaning that drivers will be able to tweak the temperature at home right through their dashboards. Even so, most automakers are still trepidatious about fully embracing in-car app systems, like Apple’s CarPlay and Android Auto. Many hope to create their own app systems for drivers, so they can fully control the experience. But as you can see with The Verge’s ScreenDrive series, that often amounts to a frustrating driving experience.

Facebook wants to hold the key Next: Navy and Marines crack down on nude photo sharing by Kate Bevan 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Your daily round-up of some of the other stories in the news Google plans native adblocker in Chrome Google is reportedly planning to build a native adblocker into the desktop and mobile versions of its browser Chrome, according to the Wall Street Journal. This seems ridiculously counter-intuitive: Google makes pretty much all of its money from advertising, but there is method in this apparent madness, it seems. By taking much more direct control over the kind of ads that are blocked and the ones that are whitelisted, Google will in theory have much greater control over ads Chrome users do or don’t see, especially if those users don’t then go and install a third-party adblocker. The Journal reports that it’s likely to block by default the more obnoxious adverts such as autoplaying videos, interstitials and pop-ups as defined by the Coalition for Better Ads, of which Google is a member. It’s not a done deal, and there are issues to be ironed out around which ads precisely would get whitelisted, but it’s an interesting move and one to watch. Facebook seeks expert to tackle fake news With the upcoming British general election in June joining the French and German polls, concern continues to mount about the way fake news spreads and potentially influences voting. Facebook, a big focus of that concern, has stepped up its efforts by announcing it’s looking to hire someone to lead on tackling fake news. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Recode reported on Thursday that Facebook is looking for someone who combines both the news and technology credentials to fill the post, which it says will report to Fidji Simo, the company’s vice-president in charge of news and video. The aim is to lead development of Facebook’s news products – like the now largely defunct Instant Articles product – and finding ways to combat the spread of fake news on the platform. Asteroid squeaks by Earth Earth didn’t get hit by what NASA described as a “relatively large” asteroid on Wednesday – but it was a near miss, apparently. Well, a near miss in cosmic terms, that is: the asteroid, known as JO25, missed us by just 1.1m miles, “a very close approach for an asteroid of this size,” said NASA. The asteroid, which was first spotted in 2014 by astronomers in Arizona, came at us from the direction of the sun, and will be visible to telescopes from the Earth for a few days. JO25 is about 650 metres in size, said NASA, and was spotted by the space agency’s programme to monitor near-earth objects. The good news is that it won’t get this close to us again for another 500 years.

Reply Tim Bushell says: April 20, 2017 at 7:51 pm Just to be clear on the ‘near miss’ the asteroid distance at 1.1million is OVER THREE TIMES the distance to the moon, so not even journalistically ‘near’ really : ))))) Reply Kate Bevan says: April 20, 2017 at 8:02 pm Close in astronomical terms, as NASA said.

Not sure what happened there – I have edited the links out by hand and will ask our web development folks (I nearly wrote “peops” but caught myself just in time :-) if they can figure it out. Thanks for pointing it out… Reply Paul Ducklin says: April 20, 2017 at 10:10 pm It is indeed more than 3x the distance to the moon (which is, of course, not constant anyway) – 4.6x, according to NASA. But I’d say it’s near enough, journalistically or not. (I bet that if a 250kg lump of frozen aeroplane toilet waste – is that a thing, or is it an urban myth? – plopped odorously but otherwise harmlessly into the back garden of the house three doors down from yours, you’d refer to it as a “near miss” when you dined out on the story, journalistically or not :-) Reply Pingu says: April 20, 2017 at 9:50 pm 1.1M miles is not much when compared to the orbit of the asteroid – a small percentage difference (in terms of the orbit) swallows 1.1M miles Reply Jim says: April 20, 2017 at 10:38 pm The problem with fake news is that there is inherent bias in all people. Hiring one person to oversee things will decidedly NOT help. Just look at the garbage that passed for “news” on the two ends of the political spectrum in the US’ last election. There are very high-level players on both ends of the spectrum that simply accept everything they see that agrees with their liberal/conservative views. Even the major news networks and sources have huge biases in one direction or the other. The counter-argument will be predictable: we’re only FACT-checking. But, that’s the job of the media, and they fail miserably at it. Having one person in charge merely means that the other end of the spectrum from that person’s views will be underrepresented. Reply Laurence Marks says: April 21, 2017 at 12:58 am “Facebook [is] looking to hire someone to lead on tackling fake news.” How about Barbara and David Mikkelson? Reply Mark Stockley says: April 21, 2017 at 5:26 pm I understand that Facebook already work with Snopes (the fact checking website founded by Barbara and David Mikkelson for anyone wondering who Laurence is talking about).

If you want this phone, just pick the size that fits you with no compromises or additional considerations. That's a rare thing indeed: Apple's iPhone has different resolutions and cameras, Huawei's P10 models vary in a whole range of specs; even Google's Pixel, the purest of Android phones, offers a different resolution on the larger device's display. And what a phone the Samsung Galaxy S8 is: as company's most accomplished device to date, it casts a long shadow over its competition. Samsung Galaxy S8+ review: Designed around the Infinity Display  Dual-edge 18.5:9 aspect Infinity Display 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1mm, 173g IP68 water/dust resistance While the transition from Galaxy S6 edge+ to Galaxy S7 edge had some blink-and-you'll-miss-it changes, the Galaxy S8 looks to catapult this phone into the future. There's a sweeping run of changes to this phone, but it's distinctly Galaxy. Dual curved edges, sculpted sides and a glass back is all familiar territory, as is the water resistance. Pocket-lint There's a big change on the front in the reduction of bezels top and bottom, shifting the aspect ratio to 18.5:9 (close to 2:1). That would be unique had Korean rivals LG not pipped Samsung to the post with the launch of the LG G6. The S8+'s ratio is fractionally different to the G6, but the motivations for both are the same. The aim is to increase the screen-to-body ratio and give you more display without resulting in a wider overall phone. The Samsung Galaxy S8+ has a huge 6.2-inch display, but it's only 73.4mm wide. That's narrower than the iPhone 7 Plus, while only being fractionally taller - but giving you over half an inch more display. Of course, changing the aspect results in that display increase: it's taller rather than wider, so although the diagonal is larger you don't get the same display area as you would from a 6.2-inch 16:9 phone.  Pocket-lint Essentially, Samsung has expanded the display into sections of the phone that used to be top and bottom bezel, shifting the controls onto the display and, amongst other things, ditching that logo bar at the top. Moving the controls onto the display is something that Samsung has avoided for many years, but it now necessitates moving the fingerprint scanner to the rear of the device and a pressure-sensitive home button under the display - but more on those later.  Surprisingly, although the S8+ has that huge display, it isn't too big. It's only fractionally taller than the S7 edge, so we've had no problem slipping it into a pocket. Keeping the width in check also means it's easy enough to grip, although there's no avoiding the it's nigh-on impossible to reach the top one-handed without changing your grip. Is the S8 too big? For some, perhaps, but then there's the same spec Galaxy S8 that offers the same experience, but in a slightly smaller 5.8-inch package. Pocket-lint About the only downside to the S8+ design is the speaker. There is a single speaker on the bottom and its performance is rather flat and boring. If you want great speaker performance, you'll probably want to look at the forthcoming HTC U instead. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review: Smackdown specs  Samsung Exynos 8895, 4GB RAM 64GB storage + microSD 3500mAh battery, USB Type-C, wireless charging Gigabit LTE Outside of design, the Samsung Galaxy S8+ comes with fully-updated internals. For the geeks, this phone is the first to be powered by a 10nm chipset. Sure, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium will be too, but Samsung is the first to market, showcasing a new breed of hardware that others will follow. The HTC U has been delayed for those, we're sure the OnePlus 5 will follow suit, too, but for now the Samsung Galaxy S8 is the first with this new powerhouse hardware. Pocket-lint There's a serene slickness to the Galaxy S8+ in operation. It skips through daily tasks without breaking a sweat, like a lithe athlete. It gobbles up everything in its path, rolling on like an unstoppable machine. The move to 10nm architecture brings with it new efficiencies and the new-generation GPU offers more clout for gaming and movie watching antics. The generous range of multi-tasking options take advantage not only of the power, but also the display's quirky aspect ratio. Multi-tasking isn't new to Samsung, it's been an option for a couple of years, but there's a feeling that Samsung is leading and Google is following: what came first - TouchWiz multi-screen or Nougat's split screen? You already know the answer. The result is a first class experience and in the week that we've been using the Galaxy S8+ we've experienced nothing but smooth running. This isn't a phone that gets overly hot either, it all feels calm, controlled and at the top of its game. That's as much a testament to the user experience provided by Samsung's software as it is from the hardware that powers it. The USB Type-C connection on the bottom of the phone is a welcome shift-up from the Micro-USB of the S7 generation devices, here charging a 3,500mAh cell. That's a pretty big number, but it's becoming par for this size of device. It performs as you'd expect, offering day-long battery life and often carrying on into the next day without too much bother. Hit your phone hard with a lot of display time, however, and it will naturally drop faster. Pocket-lint There's support for wireless charging for an ad hoc top-up, plus fast charging to bring you back into contention in no time at all - but there's also a focus on optimisation for battery performance. Not only does it take advantage of Nougat's enhanced power-saving features like Doze, but there's reasonable power saving options to toggle on too, with loads of customisation so you get the result you want. It all works nicely. Samsung Galaxy S8+ review: A display to die for  6.2-inch, 2960 x 1440 pixels (529ppi) AMOLED Infinity Display with dual edges; 18.5:9 aspect ratio Mobile HDR Premium certification  The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is all about that display. In our opinion, it's the best-looking display you'll find on a mobile device. Pocket-lint But let's take some time to justify that statement. The performance of this display is staggeringly good. It uses an AMOLED panel - something that Samsung has a reputation for using on generations of Galaxy S devices - which, in the S8+, delivers a depth and richness that makes those other devices feel a little dated and lacklustre.  The new 18.5:9 aspect, which eats into much of the space which otherwise would be bezel, is the other eye-catching point. Some may say this is just to show off, to keep things interesting, to ensure this phone looks like more than a boosted Galaxy S7 edge. There's some credence to that argument, but equally this Infinity Display does look fantastic and will catch people's attention for being different. Importantly, however, it's a display that offers jaw-dropping visuals. Once you've started using the S8, any notion that it's a marketing ploy will vanish, especially when you set it to task watching movies and indulging in your favourite entertainment. It's here that the S8+ blends its inky black AMOLED skills with the black of the minimal bezel, so if you're not watching content that happens to be in a wider format (like a movie), then it doesn't look like you're staring at black bars left and right, given how they blend in so perfectly.  Pocket-lint When you do hit that wider content - like something on Netflix shot in a wider aspect, which is the case for Stranger Things and many other Originals titles - then, wow, the display eats you up in masterclass fashion.  This is also an HDR (high dynamic range) capable display, able to show content more dynamically then other devices - in terms of peak brightness but also, and importantly, colour gamut (presenting more colours for a richer look). However, the services that offer HDR content (Netflix, Amazon Video) are yet to enable those services for mobile (it's only on TVs at the time of writing), so we've not even seen the best visuals that this phone will offer. That said, fire up Daredevil's oppressive dark scenes and the Galaxy S8+ already handles them with aplomb. Mobile HDR: Dolby Vision, HDR10, Mobile HDR Premium explained There's a shift in resolution to 2960 x 1440 pixels, which is pretty close to the Google Pixel XL - a phone that feels much bigger in the hand. That means incredible detail from this Samsung, although the default mode is 1080p to save on the battery consumption. That drop in detail won't make a big difference to things like emails and social media - and when you need the higher-resolution you can select it. Huawei offers a similar feature, with a lower-resolution saver in the settings of the P10 and P10 Plus to help battery life. Ok, so Samsung isn't alone in offering a high-resolution display at this new quirky aspect, as the LG G6 offers it too. But as we said in our opening gambit, Samsung offers you a choice of two sizes, plus there's the killer blow from the curved edges. Pocket-lint The other thing is brightness. Step into bright sunshine and the S8+ reacts, punching through reflections with the brightness to cope with the great outdoors. There's a lot of flagship phones that won't do this - or be far too slow to react. Detail, brightness, deep blacks, a richness to colours, Mobile HDR Premium certification: there's little you can do to hide from the magnificence of the Galaxy S8+ display - and little more you could ask for. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review: Fingerprint misses the mark, iris scanner arises  Iris scanner Face recognition Rear fingerprint scanner Pressure-sensitive home button The perfect phone, huh? Not quite. The elephant in the room is that whole fingerprint scanner and home button thing. The fingerprint scanner is now on the back, but it's not executed as well as, say, the Google Pixel. That device is a masterclass in rear positioning, while the Galaxy S8+ sadly is not. Pocket-lint But let's rewind a little. Back in 2010 the original Samsung Galaxy S had a physical home button. Every Galaxy S model has followed suit, as Samsung avoided the temptation to go for on-screen controls. That physical button has more recently contained the fingerprint scanner, resulting in a rather iPhone-like result, but one that worked. You press the button, the phone unlocks.  Moving the display into the bezel space means no room for that button and no room for that fingerprint scanner. Its position on the rear, flanking the camera, is just awkward. Devices like the Google Pixel avoid this because it's only the fingerprint scanner in the centre back, while the camera is to the corner. With the Samsung you need to land your finger on the scanner and not hit all the other stuff it sits alongside.  Muscle memory will help. After about a week of use we found it easy to hit the S8+'s scanner every time. The bigger problem, however, is that it didn't unlock every time. Which, from our use, sees the S8's fingerprint scanner go from the 100 per cent record of the S7 edge, to more like 85 per cent. Pocket-lint It's fortunate, then, that Samsung offers a range of biometric unlocking options. There's the normal password and pattern stuff, but more pertinent is one of the features from the Note 7. No, not spontaneous combustion, but the iris scanner. Register your eyes, look at your phone and it unlocks. Of course you need to trigger that and you can do so with a long press on the virtual home button. In essence, using the new virtual home button and the iris scanner is as easy as the old fingerprint scanner arrangement.  For those who don't want to stare into the red lights that the iris scanners use, then you have the option for face recognition too. This is a locking system that's been subject to more scrutiny because people might be able to unlock your phone with a photo of you. Still, you have choices and we've found a combination of fingerprint and iris have served us well. Now, long-term Samsung users might be taken aback by the on-screen buttons. Samsung has belligerently stuck to off-screen controls for a long time, while most of Android has moved on-screen. The change means you can't just press the button to go to the homescreen; instead the pressure sensitivity and haptic feedback give you the sense you've pressed a button that's just a virtual one on the screen. It's a change for Samsung users but it's not a bad thing. It actually feels like Samsung has taken a step forward, throwing off one of the vestiges that was holding it back.  Pocket-lint It also means that the navigation bar can be dynamic. If you've been cursing Samsung for having its back and recent apps buttons arranged in reverse order compared to every other Android device, you can now change that. You can also have Samsung's Game Centre gaming controls on this navigation bar too, out of the way, but easy to reach. Samsung Galaxy S8 tips and tricks: An expert's guide Samsung Galaxy S8+ review: Great cameras  Rear 12-megapixel f/1.7 Front 8-megapixel f/1.7 Multi-frame image processing Bixby integration The Samsung Galaxy S7 was one of our favourite camera experiences of 2016, so it's perhaps no surprise that not a lot has changed in 2017 on the S8+. Much has remained the same both in terms of the hardware and the camera experience, from fast shooting to HDR capture and good all-round performance. There's a nip and a tuck to the camera experience here and there, but on the whole it's very familiar. As it's 2017, there's the addition of some AI elements, like Snapchat-style masks you can put on yourself or other people. Being firmly positioned in Generation X it's something we're loathe to use: fun as it is for millennials, we can't help feeling that Snapchat's dog face is Shapchat's and Samsung can't usurp that with its own additions. Pocket-lint With quick launch now taking a double-press of the standby button, the time to shooting is brief. The camera is fast to focus, offers a full range of manual control options including raw shooting and is a great performer in all conditions. One of the obvious enhancements is that there's now video stabilisation at higher resolutions, probably thanks to more processing power under the hood. There's also been a bump in hardware around the front with a higher-resolution 8-megapixel camera. Looking to capture your best angle, the front camera now uses autofocus too, meaning selfies are generally sharper. It also means you can have more control over the focus in selfies, with the ubiquitous blurring options that come with that. Pocket-lint While performance is good in all areas, in low-light you will see a drop in detail as the camera processes away image noise. Sometimes low-light scenarios will result in slightly blurry images because of using a slower shutter speed, but with an f/1.7 aperture lens on board chances are you'll get an image more usable than the smaller-aperture competition. We're also fans of the on-screen exposure compensation slider that's offered. If a low-light scene is boosted to be too bright (like a sunset, for example), you can easily slide the brightness down to ensure you get those rich colours you want. It's all easy to use. Pocket-lint The only real complaint is the addition of AI stickers and Bixby Vision, which adds some unnecessary clutter to the app - plus there's no way to remove these. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review: Supreme software, but Bixby's a bore Android Nougat with TouchWiz Bixby isn't complete, adds duplication Google Assistant The thing that Samsung is shouting about the most in the Galaxy S8 is Bixby. That's the name of Samsung's new AI service which incorporates a whole range of functions, as well as scoring itself a physical button on the left-hand side of the phone. Bixby aims to span the entire Samsungverse of all devices, but starts its campaign on the Galaxy S8 phones.  Pocket-lint It doesn't start well, however, as it misses out the core element: there's no Bixby Voice. That means no speaking commands to control your phone's hardware and interact with its apps. Voice is cited to land in Korea and the US first, so there's no telling when we're going to get it in the UK. What is Bixby? Samsung's smart AI explained Outside of the missing Voice part, Bixby sits in Bixby Home, a sort of amalgam of Google Now and previous Upday/Flipboard offerings, serving up the news and integrating apps to give you a page of stuff very much like Google Now, or the rehashed version you get from the Google Search app these days. It's ok, feeding you calendar events, reminders, weather and integrating stuff like Uber and Spotify on the off-chance that you want those things while liberally browsing this page. It's not hugely exciting, though, because no one really needs this information in one place. You probably have a weather clock widget and if you want to play Spotify music, you go to the app - it opens in a flash, so why have another page offering a widget-y experience? Pocket-lint So let's ignore Bixby, because it's about the only weakness in the Samsung Galaxy S8+'s software experience. Plus the S8+ offers the full Google Assistant experience via a long press the virtual home button. And Google's own AI is plenty good at voice interaction already. Otherwise the software experience is as good as they come. And there was once a time when we'd have said Samsung's TouchWiz reskin was too much, that it was overwrought and full of bloat. Now it trounces HTC Sense, stomps on Huawei's EMUI and outclasses LG's UX too. TouchWiz even has the option to not install Samsung's apps when you start up the phone. Amazing, huh? We love that choice, that Samsung is finally confident enough to let you choose the apps you want. Pocket-lint But for all this refinement, finding all the stuff that the S8+ can do will take you an age. There are choice, options, and personalisation decisions to be made all over the place. We've mentioned customising the navigation bar, but you can turn off Samsung's app reshaping, you can have no apps tray icon, you can have no apps tray, you can fiddle around with just about anything you want. This might be a phone that will sell to the mass market, but it's a geek phone once you dive under the surface. From headphone tuning, to always-on display customisation, edge screen functions and the ability to push apps to run in full screen, the software experience of the Galaxy S8+ is in-depth. It feels like a phone that's always looking to sort you out and get you connected - whether to TV, speakers or Chromecast - without so much as a need to open something like the Bluetooth settings. Pocket-lint Bixby, we're sure, will one day have its place in all this, but there's Samsung Connect too, which looks to smooth out those connections and make things simpler. And with Samsung looking to take over the connected home we suspect there'll be a lot more connectivity updates to come and, hopefully, make everything even better than it already is. Verdict Samsung waited a little later in 2017 to unleash its flagship phone - but it was well worth the wait. Exquisite design, a high-quality waterproof build, great camera, plus 3.5mm headphone socket for those decent AKG headphones just to kick off to list of positives. But it's the refined software experience - which offers you choices and functions - and top-class performance where the S8+ outstrips other flagships. And then there's that display. At first glance it looks big, but in the hand it feels just fine. Some might think the near-2:1 aspect ratio to be odd, but once it's been put to use binge watching Netflix or Amazon Video you'll fall in love with the quality and the expansiveness that it offers. A marketing ploy? A risky move? Perhaps. Something that you'll love using? Definitely.  Sure, the Galaxy S8+ will simply be too big for some. Yes, you can't reach the top of the screen easily without shuffling your grip either. And then there's the poorly placed fingerprint scanner, which is squished against the side of the camera on the rear. Oh, and let's not forget the £779 asking price, which is Apple expensive.  But when then there's Stranger Things is glorious widescreen, battery life that doesn't really care how long your day is, and a user experience that casts a long shadow over the flagship competition, the S8+ is unrivalled. In short: the Samsung Galaxy S8+ is a masterpiece. It's expensive, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless. Alternatives to consider... Pocket-lint LG G6 First out of the gate with this new taller aspect display was the LG G6. It might have pipped Samsung to the post in announcing its phone, but both devices hit the shelves around the same time. The Samsung is more fully featured and more powerful, but it's also more expensive. LG brings its innovative dual camera to the party and also promises Dolby Vision content from its HDR display.  Read the full review: LG G6 review Pocket-lint Google Pixel XL If you want a big-screen phone without the weird 18.5:9 ratio, the Pixel XL is the mac-daddy of phones. It's pure, enhanced Android with all of Google's latest tricks packed in to a fast, powerful device with a brilliant camera and exemplary battery life. It is, however, less powerful than the Samsung despite being quite close in price. Read the full review: Google Pixel XL review Pocket-lint iPhone 7 Plus If you want it all but without the Android part, the 7 Plus is your best bet. iPhones have long offered a consistently good experience. It's excellently built, has a great dual camera system, last more than a day on one charge and looks stunning in Jet Black. Add that to the best apps available anywhere and software update support for years, and you get a compelling all-round package.  Read the full review: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review Samsung Galaxy S8 pre-order deals - You can get the Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB in orchid grey or black: £79.99 up front, £45.99 per month on EE for 24 months, 5GB data, unlimited minutes and texts - get it here - Those looking to go with Vodafone, can get the Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB in orchid grey or black: £100 up front, £42 per month on Vodafone for 24 months, 24GB data, unlimited minutes and texts - get it here - If you prefer O2, the Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB is available in orchid grey or black.

Image: google By Freia Lobo2017-04-21 16:19:29 UTC Google has partnered with Samsung, the world's largest Android smartphone maker, with a special version of Google Play Music, the two companies announced on Friday. Samsung previously launched its own streaming service, Milk which was subsequently shut down.  The special partnership will also include integrations with Samsung's AI assistant Bixby when it launches, which will work like the Assistant integration on Google Home. SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy S8 is now available in the U.S. Samsung, a wildly successful hardware maker has long struggled with what role it plays in the software and services world. Samsung has long been dependent on Google for software services, on and off making competing products of its own like Milk and S Health, now Samsung Health (which replicates much of what Google Fit does).  The Bixby integration with is telling, because Samsung seems to be pinning much of its software ambitions to its new digital assistant. Tying Google Play Music to Bixby could be key to its success, and by extension Samsung as a software provider. Image: google The partnership is important for Google, too. Google Play Music will now be the the default music player and service on all new Samsung phones and tablets globally — and Samsung sells a lot of phones. This starts with Galaxy S8 and S8+, which are now available in the U.S., Canada and South Korea. That potentially opens up a whole new audience to Play Music, which is competing with Spotify, Apple Music and Google's own YouTube to name a few.  Defaults are powerful, and being the default player on the biggest Android smartphone maker could be just what Play Music needs to take off. Samsung users will also get special Play Music features as part of the partnership. Samsung users can upload and stream up to 100,000 of their own songs to Play Music for free, double of what non-Samsung Play users are allowed. New Samsung phones and tablets will also come with a free three-month trial of the service, which includes a free trial to YouTube Red. Samsung's basic Music player app isn't going away; it'll still be on the company's phones (for now), though Play Music will be the default.  WATCH: The new 'Gear 360' camera is smaller and works with iPhones Topics: Google, Google Play Music, music streaming, samsung, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

In exchange, Google has promised that its music service will work in harmony with Samsung’s very own Bixby personal assistant. Samsung is leaving no stones unturned to make sure Bixby is a success; the personal assistant even comes with a dedicated hardware button on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Unfortunately, Bixby’s launch hasn’t been as smooth as one would have hoped for. Google Play Music’s integration with Bixby means that users would be able to ask Bixby to play a certain song or playlist off their Google Play Music library, just like it works with Google Assistant. Additionally, Samsung users will be able to upload up to 100,000 songs for free to their Google Play Music library. Normally, the service only allows upload of up to 50,000 songs for users on the free tier. Lastly, Google is bundling a free three month trial of the service with all new Samsung devices. YouTube Red, for markets where it is available, will also be included in this subscription, delivering not only an ad-free music service, but also an ad-free YouTube experience. Samsung has tried its hand before at building a music streaming service. The South Korean giant launched Milk Music back in 2014 for Galaxy owners in the US, but the service failed to compete and ended up being shut down in 2016. Milk Video, Samsung’s attempt at building a video streaming service, shared a similar fate. Google’s decision to integrate with Bixby rather than fight it is interesting, but it benefits both companies in the end.
