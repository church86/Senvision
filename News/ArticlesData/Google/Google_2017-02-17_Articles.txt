Name: Subject: Message: “Really Blue” Google Pixel launching in the UK on February 24 News UKby Edgar Cervantes12 seconds ago February 17th, 2017 The Google Pixel proved to be a great contender after getting an 8.9 score in our review, but the “Quite Black” and “Very Silver” colors it originally launched in may not be your cup of tea. Looking for something bolder? Take a look at the new “Really Blue” version, which we have seen launched in the US and Canada already. We now know this blue edition will launch in the UK. For all intents and purposes, this is pretty much the same Google Pixel you already know and love… except blue. Those who want to learn more about the phone can read our reviews on it, but be sure it is a great phone with great specs. These include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 4 GB of RAM, a 5-inch 1080p screen, a 2,770 mAh battery and plenty of other great features. But likely the most exciting factor regarding this phone is the peace of mind you will get from being among the first to get updates and new Android software. Google Pixel XL review: a Pixel’s perspective Google Pixel review: a technical deep dive Interested? UK residents will be able to get the “Really Blue” Google Pixel starting February 24. This is a limited edition color, though, so interested customers should sign up before stock begins to run out. Pre-orders open up on February 17, so you might as well put your name to one now. Prices vary depending on your plan and monthly payments, but you could get it for free, depending on your choice of service. Go ahead and check out EE and Carphone Warehouse for all the details.

Tom Regan, @grapedosmil 02.14.17 in Internet Comments 2200 Shares Share Tweet Share Save After years spent attempting to clean the internet's murky waters, Google's latest transparency report reveals it has now received takedown requests for over a million different sites. With its individual URL removal request count now reaching the billions, these new figures suggest that pirates now have more options than ever when it comes to stealing digital cargo. The number of takedown requests are up significantly from last year, thanks in part to copyright-holder's increasingly widespread use of algorithms that automatically inform Google of copyright-infringing content. While the numbers are staggering, it's hardly surprising that the world's most popular search engine gets inundated with requests to remove illegal content from its search results. What is unexpected, however, is that the report shows sites like The White House and The U.S Department of Justice have had repeated requests to remove their content. The U.S Government isn't alone though, with legitimate sites like NASA, Netflix, the BBC and The New York Times also regularly making the naughty list. Some of these baffling requests can of course, be chalked down to copyright software errors, but interestingly, Google's transparency reports also expose governments that are trying to censor certain content. With political articles and videos regularly coming under fire from governments around the world, transparency reports allow citizens to easily keep tabs on their government. Other reports, however, are less nefarious. A site that's no stranger to being unjustly harassed by copyright holders is the movie database site, IMDB. Where most legitimate sites get accidental reports in the dozens, In recent years the popular movie page has had requests to remove over 1000 of its URLs. Unsurprisingly, Google refused to remove the site's URLs from search results. Still, the vast majority of these copyright infringements can undoubtedly be linked with a rise in piracy. With US internet service providers recently abandoning their piracy warning system before the UK has even implemented the policy, it seems as though making piracy sites harder to find is currently many rights' holders best option.

The company had earlier added labels like local, satire and user-generated ones, and added the fact check tag later, to stop fake news from propagating. The feature is live on Google News in browsers, and on Google News and Weather on iOS and Android apps. The tag will also be visible in the news mode search, i.e when clicking the ‘news’ section after a regular search. Interestingly, yesterday, Google’s chief business officer, Philipp Schindler had said that “We have to take the fake news problem very, very seriously and think about what we can do there.” Google has been very active in recent times about cracking down on fake news – it recently also launched CrossCheck, a joint project to debunk fake news related to the upcoming French elections. Additionally, it currently supports 10 projects looking at fact checking and authentication across UK, Scotland, Italy and Norway, so we expect these countries will see the launch of fact checking tags next. Google had also kicked off 200 publishers from its ad networks last quarter, partly to address the fake news problem. Note that Google is not the only company working on authenticating news – last month Facebook rolled out its fake news filter in Germany, a month after launching in the US. The feature lets users tag fake news as fake, warn others, or block users sharing such news. Facebook would also evaluate the reported news in partnership with independent fact-checking organizations. Advertisement Major news sources, like Google and Facebook, have come under flak for false stories – like the one about the Pope endorsing Donald Trump before the election which outperformed real news – for adversely affecting fair elections, and in general spreading misinformation which has significantly impacted national policies. As such, tackling fake news has become a serious issue, and with regulators in various countries warning companies over fake news, companies have started taking action. 01 Related #Google #Internet #Mobile #Social Media Related Facebook to add 360 degree videos to news feed What’s New About The New Orkut; To Open Mobile API #ChennaiRains: Citizen and company initiatives for citizens of Chennai Google delinks Google+ from YouTube, other services to follow Updated: Facebook Usage In India Grows As Orkut Misses A Trick Alphabet (Google) reports $4.92B net profit on lower ad costs; Other Bets revenues at $448M < Previous Next > RBI wants differentiated debit card MDR for POS machines & QR codes Final call for #NAMApolicy: Fake News, Rumors & Online Content Regulation, 22nd Feb, Delhi – #ad Daily Newsletter More in Internet Google, Microsoft & Yahoo pulled up 6th time by SC on sex determination ads Google fact checking tag to combat fake news in South America SAIF Partners exits MakeMyTrip with $400M: report Facebook now lets businesses post job listings on the platform Hathway had 0.86M broadband subscribers in Q3FY17 Digital Jobs Creative Head Journalist Comments Tech Tips: Thanks for sharing nice info. sketharaman: '“There was no coherence between the way the editorial and...

This solution is the one used for all of Google's new gTLDs and the solution works. An announcement for this solution can look like a potentially "simple" solution for future .BRAND new gTLD applicants — but is it truly the case? When Google makes such an announcement, it immediately catches the eye of the entire new gTLD industry as well others. If such an announcement is seen as a troublemaker for other backend registry businesses, it also alerts other potential new gTLD service providers — such as law firms — that would be interested in using a registry platform to avoid contracting with a backend registry. To help us clear some points, we sent our questions to one the key people involved with Nomulus, Ben McIlwain, Google's senior software engineer who was kind enough to answer them. * * * Q: What technical knowledge would a Law Firm need to offer Trademarks their .BRAND gTLD using Nomulus? A: "A law firm? They'd definitely need technically minded people, and probably at least one developer. There are not many law firms running TLDs, I would imagine? It seems more likely to me that said hypothetical law firm would want to use a registry service provider". Q: Can Google Registrar (for US companies) be the single registrar authorized to create a ".brand" new domain name, when using Nomulus? This question is important since a registrar is required to allow the registration of domain names. A: "With a relatively small amount of custom development to Nomulus, you could add a whitelist of registrar(s) to TLDs so that only those registrar(s) could register domain names on said TLD. This would work for any registrar and isn't specific to Google Domains. It'd all be using standard EPP". Q: Does it make sense to say that Google Registry has already passed the ICANN technical requirements and so a company using Nomulus+GoogleCloud would easily pass these tests prior to being delegated? A: "Not sure. You'd still need someone who's already familiar with ICANN's pre-delegation testing process to get through it "easily". But you could say that, since we passed the testing on our ~40 TLDs, there's more assurance that someone else could do so using our software than with some other software that hasn't yet passed testing for any TLD". Q: Starting from scratch with Nomulus, and knowing that OpenRegistry was recently sold for $3.7 million, what could be the estimated cost to build a backend registry solution with Nomulus? A: "I have no idea. Hopefully not too much, but there are way too many factors in play (requirements, prevailing wage of the area in which you're hiring developers, etc.)" Q: Are there already service providers able to build a backend registry solution for third-party customers? (Such as a law firm looking for a service provider to build its solution.) A: "There are registry service providers that exist, e.g. Rightside and Afilias. Did you mean using Nomulus though? If so, I'm not aware of any, but maybe someone would do so in the future?" Q: Automating and managing the invoicing process seems to be a though part of a backend registry solution: how can Nomulus help simplify this for an entrepreneur willing to operate a generic TLD dedicated to selling domain names? A: "I don't entirely understand the question. "though part"? The problem is that there are so many potential different ways to handle invoicing and payments, and what is available/allowable likely differs from country to country, that you'd probably need to end up developing stuff yourself. We provide some billing queries that aggregate billing events on a monthly basis and group them by registrar, which gets you most of the way towards generating invoices, and we also provide integration with Braintree, which is a US-based credit card payment processor that handles USD. Most of what someone would need is thus already available, assuming that Braintree is a viable option for them, which it may not be in most countries. Of course, all the standard disclaimers of the Apache 2.0 license apply, i.e. the work is provided "on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE." We just release the code, and we happen to be using it for our purposes, but we don't offer it as a service or provide any kind of warranty or guarantee". Q: Is there, by any chance, a possibility that Google would offer a .BRAND key-in-hand solution prior to the start of the next round (to take place somewhere between mid 2018 & 2020? A: "I don't know". Q: Nomulus (developed) comes as an entirely new solution for the next round of the ICANN new gTLD program: why isn't there more marketing done about it? Is it too early? A: "I don't know". Q: The 'nomulus.domains' domain name is registered: so why does it not redirect to an official presentation of Nomulus? A: "Our official domain name for Nomulus is https://nomulus.foo, and that's the only one we reference. We've registered other domain names defensively, nomulus.domains being one of them, but we're not too concerned about them. Similarly, we have google.horse, but it's not redirected to google.com; we just don't use it". By Jean Guillon, New generic Top-Level Domains' specialist.

HR and IT combine efforts on workforce analytics Tips for negotiating with cyber extortionists See all Insider SAN FRANCISCO -- In some ways, Google is like every other large enterprise. It had the typical defensive security posture based on the concept that the enterprise is your castle and security involves building moats and walls to protect the perimeter. Over time, however, that perimeter developed holes as Google’s increasingly mobile workforce, scattered around the world, demanded access to the network. And employees complained about having to go through a sometimes slow, unreliable VPN. On top of that, Google, like everyone else, was moving to the cloud, which was also outside of the castle. In other ways, Google is unlike any other company. Without much of a detailed business plan or cost/benefit analysis, Google execs gave the green light to an ambitious project aimed at totally reinventing the company’s security infrastructure.

After discussing her father's work, Chloe Bridgewater decided she would like to work for Google and penned a letter beginning "dear Google boss". It was only the schoolgirl's second letter, after her first missive to Father Christmas, but the search engine's CEO Sundar Pichai wrote back, BBC reported. Her father Andy said the girl "took it all in her stride". "We were gobsmacked, but I don't think Chloe could understand the magnitude of the reaction she'd got afterwards," said father Andy, a sales manager from Hereford. "She's got a great entrepreneurial spirit. Ever since nursery, she's always been told in school reports she's bright, hard-working and polite - we're very proud of her and her younger sister [Hollie, five] is similar," he said. Mr Pichai's full reply "Thank you so much for your letter. I'm glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology. "I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to - from working at Google to swimming at the Olympics. "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :) "All the best to you and your family."

But today brings news of at least one injection of supply, as Google has announced that the previously Verizon-exclusive “Really Blue” variant will be coming to the UK. Both regular 5-inch and XL 5.5-inch sizes will be available, though only with 32GB of storage. The company notes that the blue Pixel is a limited-edition color — as if the other models weren’t limited enough already — and therefore will only be sold “until stocks last.” That could well mean that the good people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be fighting over a shipment of seventeen phones, but preorders open today through EE and Carphone Warehouse if you’d like to try your luck. The blue Pixels will then be available in UK stores on February 24th.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive This Desert Life: History in your hand Friday Feb 17, 2017 at 12:01 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe A few months ago, I downloaded onto my cell phone what’s become my favorite digital tool: Field Trip. Field Trip is a location-based app that sends notifications when users are in proximity to places of interest. An example: as I strolled north toward the corner of Sixth and A streets in Victorville last Sunday, Field Trip notified me that I was near the Old Victor School. Once notified, users can access information about the site through the app. In the school’s case, I learned the 95-year-old building was the third elementary school built in Victorville and has been restored “at least once by dedicated and forward-thinking citizens.” The known world became a part of Field Trip in 2012. The app was designed by Niantic Inc., the company better known for unleashing Pokemon Go on an unsuspecting populous last year. Field Trip was the first app released by Niantic, when the now-independent company was part of Google. At the time, The Atlantic described Field Trip as “Google's probe into the soft side of augmented reality,” a tool, in other words, meant to alter how the world is perceived and interacted with through Google Glass. So, imagine staring through the digitized lenses of Google Glass and seeing, simultaneously, the Old Victor School and the info Field Trip has on the building. Now imagine all that in a foreign locale. Instantly, you’ve learned the intimate details of the place — as though you’ve lived there all your life. But Google Glass — and its competitors at places like Apple — has yet to augment reality on a massive scale. So, for the time being, Field Trip has been reduced to yet another distraction forcing our sights downward to screens, away from our un-augmented reality. And yet I feel slightly more connected to the High Desert and its history because of the app. In fact, it’s how I learned about Brownie, arguably Victorville’s most famous canine. Brownie was the Victorville railroad station’s “mascot” beginning in 1943 after he wandered into the depot one night, “bruised and bleeding” from an altercation with a passing car, according to a previous Daily Press article written by Ellie Moon. The station’s night telegraph operator set Brownie up with a blanket and a pan of warm milk, and the dog rested near the heat of a stove. Over time, Brownie moved to sleeping under the telegraph operator’s desk and remained “a permanent fixture at the depot.” Described as “the hungriest dog you ever saw,” Ellie wrote that although meat was rationed during World War II, railroaders saved scraps for him. A terrier and pit bull mix, Brownie was “leery of human affection at first,” but he warmed up to the workers, who eventually bestowed upon the dog the title of honorary station manager. Brownie was so adored by the railroad employees that when he was struck and killed by one of the trains in 1945, they “placed him in a typewriter box and found a shady place under a Cottonwood tree” until a more proper burial could be arranged. The workers then pooled their money together and bought Brownie a black headstone with this inscription: BROWNIE “A RAILROAD DOG” A FRIEND AND A PAL 1945. I learned about Brownie through Field Trip while on my stroll through Old Town Victorville. The app informed me the headstone is located outside the Route 66 Museum, so I visited on Thursday to pay my respects to Brownie and to ask museum volunteers if they’ve encountered the dog’s ghost (a paranormal investigation was conducted in the museum Wednesday evening). Delvin Harbour and Sue Bridges told me there have been unexplained sightings in the museum, but none involving Brownie. “If he’s anywhere, he’s probably at the railroad,” Sue said. That makes sense. The museum only inherited what’s left of Brownie. Initially, his headstone was in the nearby Forrest Park. It was moved to the museum in 2008 when the park met its end. Delvin and I got to talking after that — about Route 66 and High Desert history — and I relished in his knowledge, his passion. I left with a contented feeling only good conversation provides, which I suppose is ironic considering a cell phone app brought me there in the first place. But maybe that’s the point. There’s constant chatter of a widening disconnect between people spurred by our attachment to all things digital. And I don’t know how I feel about “augmented reality,” but I believe connecting with one another now depends on how we use technology. Because while it can easily disconnect us, it can also bring us to the Delvins and Sues out there, as well as to a mongrel dog that found compassion and friendship in a sleepy desert town.

Researchers at Google`s Project Loon -- part of the company`s X research lab -- said it was now able to use machine learning to predict weather systems, meaning the firm has a greater control over where its balloons go, making it possible to focus on a specific region, rather than circumnavigating the globe, BBC reported on Friday. "We can now run an experiment and try to give service in a particular place in the world with ten, twenty or thirty balloons," Astro Teller, head of Alphabet`s X unit (formerly Google X), was quoted as saying. Also Read: Google pushes HTTPS-based web security measures "Real users" will be able to use the system in the "coming months", he added -- but he did not specify where the initial roll out would take place. Under the project, the firm will suspend a network of huge, tennis-court sized balloons that will beam down connectivity. The balloons float in the stratosphere around 11 miles high. By raising or lowering altitude, the balloons can be caught in different weather streams, changing direction, the report said. "By using machine-learning algorithms, Google might have cracked a way to predict weather with enough accuracy to make it possible to hover balloons over a relatively small area for a long period of time," the report noted. Teller said that Project Loon was one of the more "mature" moonshot ideas at the company and Google was in "no rush" to make Project Loon a stand-alone business. Last year, Teller said the connection had advanced to deliver about 15mbps internet access.

Text Size: A A A AFP/Colombo Google's venture to beam the internet to remote areas of the world via balloon has hit a legal snag in Sri Lanka that could see the project abandoned on the island, a minister said on Thursday. "Project Loon" uses roaming balloons to beam internet coverage and planned to connect Sri Lanka's 21mn people to the web, even those in remote connectivity black spots. But just a year after testing began in Sri Lanka regulators have been unable to allocate Google a radio frequency for the airborne venture without breaching international regulations. Communications minister Harin Fernando said the Geneva-based International Telecommunications Union (ITU) was opposed to Google using the same frequency as Sri Lanka's public broadcasters to provide its internet. "It boils down to a legal issue," Fernando told reporters in Colombo. "The government as well as Google are lobbying the ITU, but if we fail there's a risk Google will go to another country that is not bound by these rules." Google's giant helium-filled balloons act as floating mobile base stations, beaming high-speed internet to areas beyond the reach of ground-based telecommunication towers. The first of three balloons -- which roam the stratosphere at twice the altitude of commercial aircraft -- entered Sri Lankan air space a year ago after being going airborne in South America. The government and Google planned a joint venture where Colombo would receive a 25% stake, without any capital investment, for sharing its cellular spectrum with the project. One of the balloons was found in a Sri Lankan tea plantation after its maiden test flight last year, although authorities described it as a controlled landing. About one-third of Sri Lankans have regular access to the internet, a figure expected to swell through the Loon project. Sri Lanka was the first country in South Asia to introduce mobile phones in 1989, and also the regional frontrunner when it unveiled a 4G network three years ago. 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

By: AP | Updated: February 17, 2017 1:23 pm The X lab, like other parts of Alphabet that are funded by Google’s highly profitable digital advertising network, is under pressure to start making money on its own. ( Source: Project Loon) For its next trick, an internet-beaming balloon factory spun out of Google believes it can outmaneuver the wind. In doing so, the 4-year-old “Project Loon” says it will be able to bring remote parts of the world online more quickly with a smaller fleet of the balloons than it previously thought. Engineers involved in the eccentric project, a part of the X Lab owned by Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc., say they have come up with algorithms that enable the high-flying balloons to do a better job anticipating shifting wind conditions so they hover above masses of land for several months instead of orbiting the earth. Watch all our videos from Express Technology X now expects to need fewer balloons to fulfill its goal of delivering internet service to billions of people living in unconnected regions in the world, ranging from small villages in Africa to the woods of California. The need for fewer balloons should lower Project Loon’s costs and accelerate plans to start selling internet-services subscriptions to consumers and businesses. The X lab, like other parts of Alphabet that are funded by Google’s highly profitable digital advertising network, is under pressure to start making money on its own. The Alphabet subsidiaries operating outside Google, a hodgepodge of far-flung projects, have lost a combined $7.1 billion during the past two years. In an acknowledgement of their lofty goals and risky nature, Alphabet CEO Larry Page calls them “moonshots.” Astro Teller, who runs the X Lab, declined to provide a specific timetable for when Project Loon might start selling internet access plans. Meeting with reporters Thursday at X’s headquarters in a former shopping mall in Mountain View, California, Teller said the project hopes to team up with a telecommunications provider within the next few months to begin testing how well the balloons’ new navigational system will work. He likened the newly developed algorithms’ objectives to “a game of chess with the wind.” Also Read:  Google working with govt to bring Project Loon with Internet balloons to India If the algorithms prevail in their meteorological battle, Project Loon hopes to need only 10 to 30 beams floating about 60,000 feet above the earth to transmit high-speed internet signals to a target market, instead of up to 400 balloons orbiting around the globe. Keeping the balloons in smaller clusters will also make them easier to locate and retrieve once they descend back to land after several months in the stratosphere, Teller said. Project Loon has been doing most of its testing recently in South America, although Teller said that isn’t necessarily where it will team up with a telecommunications provider to determine the effectiveness of its wind-defying technology. Since launching in New Zealand in 2013, the balloons have traveled 19 million kilometers, or nearly 12 million miles, according to Project Loon. Alphabet frames Project Loon as a noble endeavor striving to enable people currently without reliable internet service to tap into the vast reservoir of knowledge, entertainment and conveniences available online. But it could also enrich Google by expanding the potential audience that can query its search engine, watch video on YouTube, correspond through Gmail and click on digital ads.

PHOTO: GOOGLE MOUNTAIN VIEW, UNITED STATES: Google parent Alphabet said Thursday that artificial intelligence-infused navigation software has significantly sped up plans to deploy Project Loon internet balloons to serve remote regions of the world Word that being able to more smartly guide high-altitude baloons promised to improve coverage while curbing cost came as Loon hit headwinds in some locales where it has been testing the technology. “Out timelines are starting to move up on how we can do more for the world sooner,” said Astro Teller, who heads the team at the Alphabet unit X, in charge of “moonshot” projects of the technology giant. Google’s internet balloon plan hits legal snag in Sri Lanka “We are looking to move quickly, but to move thoughtfully,” Teller told a small group of reporters inside a former Silicon Valley shopping center transformed into a “moonshot factory.” The acceleration was credited to software leaps that allow internet-serving balloons to ride high-altitude winds to ideal locations or loop in patterns that create consistent webs of internet coverage in the sky. “We’ve been working to make the balloons smarter; almost like a game of chess with the winds,” Teller said. He expected Loon to be partnering in coming months with telecom companies to provide internet to “real users,” in a step up from tests done to see how well  the high-floating technology works with networks on the ground. Google asks for airspace access for internet balloons Teller declined to specify where Loon might first be integrated into telecommunications networks providing service to customers. “We are not going to all of a sudden be everywhere,” Teller said. “We intend to be part of an ecosystem — in any country where we are doing testing we would work with a local telco.” Part of the money-making vision for Loon would be to get revenue from telecom operators for extending their reach. Teller said Loon is one of the more mature projects at X and that it “would be a natural state to graduate into its own company” but there were no plans at the moment for that to happen. The peek inside X lab and word of speedy progress came the same day that the venture to beam the internet to the ground via balloon hit a legal snag in Sri Lanka that could see the project abandoned on the island. Project Loon uses roaming balloons to beam internet coverage and planned to connect Sri Lanka’s 21 million people to the web, even those in remote connectivity black spots. But just a year after testing began in Sri Lanka regulators have been unable to allocate Google a radio frequency for the airborne venture without breaching international regulations. “There are lots of places excited to run experiments with us,” Teller said. “We encourage that, but there are lots of agencies and we need to dot ‘I’s and cross ‘t’s.” He added that Loon planned to “do things by the book” in any country where it is active, using balloons to get internet signals far and wide, while local telecom companies tap into the network from the ground. The first public launch of Loon took place in New Zealand in 2013, when the project was in an early experimental phase. Alphabet recently told AFP that it gave up on its internet drone project, called Titan, about a year ago, to focus its resources on Loon where it saw more promise of success. The economics and technical feasibility of balloons are seen as a more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world to the internet, according to X.

A lot can be said for the company’s decision to embrace modular connectivity in a way that makes sense. You don’t turn off your Moto Z and take it apart to add new functionality. You simply lock a Moto Mod into place on the phone’s rear. Moto Mods aren’t the only thing that make the Moto Z amazing. Something like Moto Mods is only possible because of Google’s Android operating system and the things that it allows companies to do. For example, you probably didn’t know that you can open 2 apps at the same time with the Moto Z. Advertisement It’s called multitasking, and it’s possible because the Moto Z runs Android 7.0.  The software update added the ability to open 2 apps at the same time, plus other features that Google hopes will keep users glued to their Android smartphone. DayDream, for example, turns select Android smartphones into virtual reality headsets when docked with the DayDream Viewer accessory that the company recently began selling. Google calls the new features multitasking collectively. It’s because of this feature that you can send a text message and continue watching a television show at the same time, for example. Here’s how to open 2 apps on the Moto Z and the Moto Z Droid, the device’s variant that’s exclusive to Verizon. Read: Common Moto Z Droid & Moto Z Problems and Fixes How to Open 2 Apps On the Moto Z: Before We Begin Before we begin, it’s important to note a few things about multitasking in Android Nougat on the Moto Z. Advertisement The first important thing is that you need to make sure that you actually have it installed. Carriers hold some sway in when devices on their network receive updates like Android Nougat. The Moto Z Droid on Verizon has offered users the opportunity to download the update since late last year. Those that purchased the unlocked Moto Z directly from Motorola only recently began receiving Nougat. Your phone may not have it installed yet. Go to the Settings app on your phone and scroll down to the end of all your settings. If you see Android 7.0 listed under About Phone, you’ve got the software you need. If you don’t, tap About Phone and have your device check to see if there are any software updates available. The second thing that you should keep in mind is that all of your apps won’t have the ability to multitask. Developers have to have add support for the feature into their apps. Without the code necessary to get the feature working, you won’t be able to multitask with that app. Unfortunately, there’s no way to tell what apps support multitasking until you attempt to use them. Built-in apps made by Google support the feature just fine. Many of Android’s most popular applications have been updated to support multitasking, but some high-profile stalwarts remain. It’s also worth noting that some apps might never support the feature because they are no longer being updated, or their developer doesn’t believe it’s essential. Advertisement Note that this feature works whether you’re using the Google Now launcher installed on your Moto Z or a third-party launcher available for download from the Google Play Store. How to Open 2 Apps on the Moto Z: Let’s Get Started Power on your Moto Z and open one of the apps that you’d like to multitask with. For the purposes of this demonstration, we’re using Serist, a television show tracker that’s available in the Google Play Store. Open your first app. Once inside the app, hold your finger down on the square on the right of the Home button along the bottom edge of your display. Now you have two options. You can either select the other app that you’d like to open from the list of recently opened apps, or press the Home button to go the launcher and select an app that you haven’t opened yet. We’re doing the latter. Advertisement When your phone already has an app in multitasking, the status bar at the top of its display will glow the dominant color of that app. For example, ours is glowing red because that’s the dominant color of Serist. We’re going with Amazon’s Prime Video app for the second app. If the app can be used in multitasking, this is what you’ll get. If it can’t be, you’ll get a notice telling you that you can’t multitask with that app or that it might not work properly. Advertisement That’s all there is to it really. Google managed to make it very easy to get started. By default, multitasking depends on the orientation of your device. You can leave your device in portrait mode. This direction makes it easy to see and type at the same time. For example, it’s best for watching a video on the top and texting or browsing on the bottom. Landscape mode is great for working on both sides of your screen. Good luck opening 2 apps on the Moto Z. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

However, millions of users download replacement keyboards instead. Which offer better features, more customization, or a faster and better typing experience. With that in mind, these are the best keyboards for Android. Advertisement The default app on your Samsung, LG or HTC smartphone probably works fine.

In closing, every one on our list below is a trusted developer worth using. These are the best keyboards for Android. Gboard by Google   1 / 6 For years many enjoyed Google Keyboard. Essentially the stock Android keyboard available from Google Play for other devices. However, over the years Google has improved it into what's potentially the best keyboard for Android. Hands-down.  Gboard was first introduced for iPhone, after Apple started to allow third party keyboards. Then eventually Google released it for Android and replaced their original option. It has everything one will ever need from a touch keyboard. It's completely free, has tons of customization, themes, and most importantly -- Google built in.  Advertisement As you saw from the video above, there's a little "G" logo above the keyboard. Which allows users to get directions, share directions to a restaurant, do Google searches or send a GIF all from the web. Right inside the keyboard without leaving the app you're already in. It's amazingly helpful once you remember that the option exists. Between the modest theme options, gesture (swiping to text) controls and word prediction, this is the most feature-filled android keyboard. And our #1 recommendation.  Download Gboard Today   1 / 6 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Android operating system has the most number of apps in its Google Play Store and the number of apps added daily to the app market is always increasing. While most of the new apps are more of an adware, there are some apps which promise to offer a lot and does deliver but often go unnoticed. These apps either solve an issue or help make your Android experience better. We tried a bunch of these apps and have shortlisted five of those for you. So let the list begin.   Stitch and Share   Ever been in that situation where you wanted to send a full chat conversation to a friend and was forced to click multiple screenshots and sent it in random order? Stitch and Share solve this issue. In other words, this app actually lets you take extended (long) screenshots. Now, we know companies like Xiaomi, Lenovo and even OnePlus has included this feature in their built-in OS, but the smartphone market has much more products from many more companies that still doesn’t have this feature. The user interface is simple, open the app > Go to Automatic Capturing > Turn on the Accessibility for Stitch and Share > Go back and tap Automatic Screen Capturing. Now you will notice an app bot sitting on your home screen. To take an extended screenshot, go to an app (for e.g. WhatsApp), tap on the app bot and wait for the app to take the screenshot. As soon as it takes the first screenshot, scroll down a bit and wait for it to take the next screenshot and stitch it with the previous one. Repeat this step until you get your whole content in one screenshot. Once done, tap the ‘Save’ icon bot which will then take you to the app. Now here you can edit (crop, highlight and erase) or either save/share the screenshot. There is also a premium version of this app which will remove ads, remove watermark and will let you pick your own highlighting colours. Lastly, the app also automatically detect multiple screenshots and can stitch it accordingly. Note that, we couldn't make this app work on Chrome browser so there might be some limitations regarding the apps on which Stitch and Share works   Photoscan   We all love our old printed photos but there is always a risk of losing them or tearing them due to their deteriorating quality with time. What if you could digitize all your old albums without a scanner or going to a photo studio for that matter. Google has the answer. The search engine giant introduced this app called, Photoscan, back in November 2016 but we still feel that it hasn’t reached up its desired user base. To digitize your printed photos, augmented reality comes into the picture, through which PhotoScan creates four points on the frame of the photo which eventually combines the four photos to produce a glare free and sharp image. Post production, you can edit the edges and rotate as per your liking. To explain the process, Tapping on ‘Start Scanning’ brings in the app's own viewfinder which gives you an option to turn on/off your phone's LED flash. Pressing the record option brings in four points on the photograph and you then have to take the circle in the middle to those four points which will let app click four different photos. After this, the app will combine, process and give you a digitized version of the photo you were clicking a photo of.This app can help a lot in the situations when we don't have a digital image of a person and want it on our phone or even PC. Also, Google seems to have solved the previous issue of saving and viewing photos through Google Photos. In the latest version, you can save the photo to your device and can also view and edit it later via your device’s native gallery app.   Instadict   If you have a habit of reading a lot on your phone, Instadict can come in really handy. The app is basically an online dictionary which gives you the meaning of a particular world with a simple gesture. The working is really simple, while reading something on your smartphone if you want to know the meaning of a particular word, select the word > copy it (to the clipboard) > and shake your device. The app will then pop up the meaning at the bottom of your screen. We really liked how convenient this app can be for someone who is constantly reading on the go and likes to dig into dictionary every now and then for the vocabulary. Long pressing the definition will add it to your favourites. Further, you can also adjust the time window of the definition which pops up at the bottom of the screen. You can also customise the shake strength and the time between Copy and Shake delay. Currently, Instadict only works for English, French, Italian and Spanish. Apart from this, you can also download the offline dictionary to use this app while your are reading offline.   Flyso   Do you have a habit of scrolling through your social media endlessly? Flyso will help you save a bit of time here. Basically, the app is the social media hub for your Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts. No, it doesn’t merge all your feeds in one as we have seen in the past rather it gives you three different tabs at the top for Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The app is not at all heavy on memory and only takes up about 6.5 MB on your smartphone. This is because, it essentially opens up all your three social network accounts from its inbuilt browser. In other words, you will get the interface which is what you usually get when you open either of Facebook, Instagram or Twitter on your browser. Hence, you will also not get any notifications for any of the service. Other than this, the interface operates pretty well. In the brief time we used the app, we found it extremely useful. It also changes the accent colour based on the tab you are on. For instance, dark blue for Facebook, reddish for Instagram and light blue for Twitter. Further, we didn’t experience any lags or heavy battery drain even though it is loading up so much content.   Stream   Well, this is probably that feature which a lot of us crave for. While the latest Android Nougat lets you split-screen and play YouTube videos simultaneously while doing any other work on your smartphone, however, Stream takes it to the next level. To sum up in one line, Stream will let you stream YouTube videos in a pop window which can float over your smartphone’s screen no matter in which app you are. In other words, you can simply watch a YouTube video while chatting on WhatsApp, browsing on Facebook or literally anything you can do on your smartphone. Simply tap the video you want to play and the app will pop up the floating window post which you can navigate to anywhere you want on your device. Further, tapping on the floating window will show up the current Playlist and a bunch of suggestions related to the video which is being played. The app also gives you an option to adjust the size of the popup window and an option to enable Dark Mode. Apart from that, the user interface found on Stream is a lot similar to YouTube. You get four tabs up to namely, Top 100, Top Movie, Top Channel and Trending Music. We would have liked the ability to get your subscribed channels from YouTube as well, but we will let this feature pass. Since you don’t login with your YouTube account, the ability to like share and comment on any video is also missing. So Stream delivers what its meant to i.e. play YouTube videos in a pop window. However, one downside about the app is that it does show up some apps randomly in between.

Users can simply tell the speaker to order items — diapers, paper towels, or trash bags, for example, and get delivery from any of dozens of participating retailers. Amazon’s Alexa moves in on Google’s Android system “If picking up paper towels or stocking up on coffee is on your list, consider it done,” said Google Assistant product manager David Wang in a statement. “To help you keep up with your busy schedule and shop for the things you need, we’re introducing shopping with your Google Assistant on Google Home.” The service ties in with tech giant’s delivery arm Google Express, whose US retailers include Costco, Whole Foods Market, Walgreens, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond.

AP, AFP-JIJI Feb 17, 2017 Article history Online: Feb 17, 2017 Last Modified: Feb 17, 2017 PRINT SHARE MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA – For its next trick, an internet-beaming balloon factory that was spun out of Google believes it can outmaneuver the wind. In doing so, the 4-year-old “Project Loon” says it will be able to bring remote parts of the world online more quickly with a smaller fleet of the balloons than it previously thought. Engineers involved in the eccentric project, a part of the X Lab owned by Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc., say they have come up with algorithms that enable the high-flying balloons to do a better job anticipating shifting wind conditions so they hover above masses of land for several months instead of orbiting the earth. X now expects to need fewer balloons to fulfill its goal of delivering internet service to billions of people living in unconnected regions in the world, ranging from small villages in Africa to the woods of California. The need for fewer balloons should lower Project Loon’s costs and accelerate plans to start selling internet-services subscriptions to consumers and businesses. The X Lab, like other parts of Alphabet that are funded by Google’s highly profitable digital advertising network, is under pressure to start making money on its own. The Alphabet subsidiaries operating outside Google, a hodgepodge of far-flung projects, have lost a combined $7.1 billion during the past two years. In an acknowledgement of their lofty goals and risky nature, Alphabet CEO Larry Page calls them “moonshots.” Astro Teller, who runs the X Lab, declined to provide a specific timetable for when Project Loon might start selling internet access plans. Meeting with reporters Thursday at X’s headquarters in a former shopping mall in Mountain View, California, Teller said the project hopes to team up with a telecommunications provider within the next few months to begin testing how well the balloons’ new navigational system will work. He likened the newly developed algorithms’ objectives to “a game of chess with the wind.” If the algorithms prevail in their metrological battle, Project Loon hopes to need only 10 to 30 beams floating about 60,000 feet above the earth to transmit high-speed internet signals to a target market, instead of up to 400 balloons orbiting around the globe. Keeping the balloons in smaller clusters will also make them easier to locate and retrieve once they descend back to land after several months in the stratosphere, Teller said. Project Loon has been doing most of its testing recently in South America, although Teller said that isn’t necessarily where it will team up with a telecommunications provider to determine the effectiveness of its wind-defying technology. “We are not going to all of a sudden be everywhere,” Teller said. “We intend to be part of an ecosystem — in any country where we are doing testing we would work with a local telco.” The peek inside X Lab came the same day that the venture hit a legal snag in Sri Lanka that could lead to its abandonment on the island. Project Loon currently connects Sri Lanka’s 21 million people to the web, even those in remote connectivity black spots. But just a year after testing began in Sri Lanka regulators have been unable to allocate Google a radio frequency for the airborne venture without breaching international regulations. Since launching in New Zealand in 2013, the balloons have traveled 19 million kilometers, or nearly 12 million miles, according to Project Loon. Alphabet frames Project Loon as a noble endeavor striving to enable people currently without reliable internet service to tap into the vast reservoir of knowledge, entertainment and conveniences available online. But it could also enrich Google by expanding the potential audience that can query its search engine, watch video on YouTube, correspond through Gmail and click on digital ads.

Huawei is the third-largest smartphone maker to enter the competitive space of digital voice assistants. The company will have a tough road ahead at it will compete with Apple’s Siri, Google’s Google Assistant and Alexa by Amazon. One thing to note is that Alexa has just started to come on to smartphones while Siri and Google Assistant are veterans in this game. Apart from these Samsung is also working on its voice-based digital assistant Bixby that is set to enter the market with Samsung Galaxy S8 in coming weeks. Even though Huawei does not have to compete with other devices but if the company makes the digital assistant cross-platform then it will have to compete with Cortana by Microsoft, which is very capable at what it does. Cortana is still available for Android devices, but Windows 10 devices are home for Microsoft’s digital assistant. A team consisting of more than 100 engineers is working on developing the digital assistant at the company’s offices in Shenzhen in China, as reported by Bloomberg. According to the report, the company is not likely to limit the digital assistant to Huawei smartphones and it is aimed at taking on Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. The company is not worried about any smaller players in the market right now. One interesting thing to note is that Huawei is ensuring that the assistant can communicate in Chinese languages to target the Chinese market while expanding its offence against Google and Amazon outside China. The company has aimed for $33 billion in sales. It currently stands at number three in global smartphone shipments after Apple and Samsung. An amusing fact is that Huawei is the same company that announced that it will use Amazon Alexa on Huawei Mate 9 in the United States. This AI may take off as the company has very limited or no competition in the Chinese market. Google Assistant, the second major competitor, is blocked in China making it a perfect opportunity for the company to capitalise on this gap.

Google hasn't denied that it used Java software in Android, but it has maintained that it did so without violating any intellectual property laws. Last year, a court found that Google's use of Java APIs in Android constituted "fair use", which the company hailed as "a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products." Unsurprisingly, Oracle was rather less convinced by that ruling, insisting that Google had "developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market". It vowed "to bring this case back to the Federal Circuit on appeal." True to its word, Oracle has now done exactly that, filing with the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday, seeking to overturn last year's 'fair use' jury verdict. In its filing, Oracle referred to the integration of its Java APIs by Google as "classic unfair use". Last July, it referred to case law claiming that where a company "exclusively acquires conspicuous financial rewards" from the use of another company's IP, fair use considerations do not apply. Oracle said in its 155-page appeal on Friday that "Google reaped billions of dollars while leaving Oracle's Java business in tatters."

Today, the I/O website has been properly updated and is also giving out details about the application process for those that want to attend. While the developer conference used to be on a first come, first serve basis, the past few years have seen an incredible surge of folks trying to attend, leaving many out in the cold. Google changed the application format by making it a random drawing. As noted on the I/O website, the application process will start on February 22 at 10am PT and will end February 27 at 5pm PT. Google did offer a couple things to keep in mind while applying which have been detailed below. Keep in mind: -- The order in which applications are received has no bearing on the outcome. Applicants will be chosen at random after the drawing application window has ended. -- Only one application per person is allowed. -- The selected applicants will be automatically charged and will receive their ticket via email on February 28th. Google's I/O 2017 will be located at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, for the second year in a row and will take place over three days starting on May 17.

The messaging service includes features such as group chats, photo sharing and read receipts among other things, Google said in its official blog. Google said these features would come as standard on its Android operating system. Telenor subscribers, who already have Google's Messenger app on their phones, would gain access to RCS services automatically through an app update, Google said. The internet giant said it plans to roll out RCS in more countries in the coming months. Telenor said it has had a long-term strategic partnership with Google and has supported RCS being rolled out as widely as possible. "Partnering with Google for RCS at a group level is another step in this direction as it enables us to launch RCS in our respective markets," a spokeswoman said.

Friday, February 17, 2017 A look inside San Jose politics and culture Twitter Facebook San Jose Inside San Jose Inside is made possible through support by: San Jose Inside (http://_/2017/02/16/silicon-valleys-trump-resistance-chapter-orchard-city-indivisible-grows-in-strength-membership/) More News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly Categories News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly News Silicon Valley’s Trump Resistance Chapter, Orchard City Indivisible, Grows in Strength, Membership By Benjamin Siepak / 9 hours ago 7 President Donald Trump’s first month in office has galvanized the Indivisible movement to create more than 6,000 resistance groups, including one in Campbell. (Photo via Shutterstock) Four weeks ago President Donald Trump took the oath of office, protesters marched across the nation and San Jose police snipers assumed their perch. By then, the resistance was already in full swing. Trump supporters, most notably the alt-right, have dismissed protesters and critics of the new administration as “snowflakes,” which may be why grassroots organizations such as Indivisible are seeing a snowball effect. What started as a 25-page Google doc created by a group of former congressional staffers has led to Indivisible, a chain of regional groups that are rallying the nation’s anti-Trump resistance to slow down his agenda and rein in a Republican-majority Congress. The Google doc, created in mid-December, served as a guide for specific tactics to fight President Trump’s agenda, which has included a number of unpopular appointees and executive orders. The document soon morphed into a website, resulting in more than 6,000 registered resistance groups. Eric Victorino, a co-founder of Orchard City Indivisible, the South Bay’s only chapter, says the organization is using the same guidelines the conservative Tea Party movement carried out in opposing President Obama, who was far more popular at the time than Trump is currently, according to public opinion polls. “We are operating with the advantage of being a much bigger group going up against a very unpopular president,” Victorino says. Victorino and three friends decided to form the chapter, based in Campbell, just days after reading the guidelines. Meetings are centered around enacting change through planning events, voicing complaints, demanding meetings with elected officials and providing an open forum for ideas that can affect change. It’s similar to the Occupy movement from several years ago, except there seems to be far more structure. “Getting people information about what they can do is what inspired us,” says Michael Clark, an Orchard City Indivisible co-founder. Meetings, held every Tuesday, first took place in a coffee shop but greater numbers forced the group to move. The past two meeting have been hosted at Campbell United Church of Christ. “When this started our first meeting had 12 people, our next had about 30, then 75 and today we had around 120,” Victorino says. Orchard City Indivisible operates through a private Facebook group, where events, links and information are shared on a daily basis. The group now has more than 700 members who work on organizing events, designing protest signs and giving advice on where and when to deploy them. A majority of Silicon Valley voters are registered Democrats, Clark says, which has helped the resistance group get on the radar with local, state and federal agencies. David Weir, of San Jose, says the constant negative headlines forced him to do something rather than sit on the sidelines. “(It’s) the feeling we got when we woke up every day and saw bad news of acts being overturned, executive orders being filed that were discriminatory, cabinet picks that were not draining the swamp but filling it up with more alligators, and just an overall feeling of this is not how the country should be run,” Weir says. To counter these decisions, Weir and fellow Indivisible members have been calling and showing up at Congressional offices. Joana Cardoso, who has led an effort to diversify Orchard City Indivisible’s membership after the first four meetings, says that the organization is open to anyone who feels the country is heading in the wrong direction under President Trump. “There is no them—this is for everybody,” Cardoso says. “You are not alone in feeling frustrated over the craziness that’s happening.” Orchard City Indivisible will host a #NotOurPresidentDay event 10am to 2pm Monday at San Jose City Hall. The goal is to encourage resistance locally and pressure members of Congress to stand, indivisibly, in opposition to the Trump administration.

Reply John Galt Feb 16, 2017 @ 6:47 pm Quite often President Trump will say or do something that has me questioning whether I should have voted for him. But then all I have to do is turn on KGO or read an SJI column like this one or hear Lick-a-rod or Chief Eddie utter a few words and I’m instantly reminded of what I voted against and am reassured that I made the right choice. Reply Smokey Feb 16, 2017 @ 9:25 pm JG, Don’t forget what might have been: ‘Obama 2.0′. That alone was an excellent reason to vote for DJT. And from what I’ve seen so far, President Trump is turning out to be even better than expected. He’s certainly not paying any attention to the impotent chihuahuas trying to bite his ankles. Instead, he’s doing what’s best for the country—and they just HATE that! Reply George Feb 16, 2017 @ 8:26 pm Very cool!!

When she found out about Google – and the perks of working there with slides, go-karts and bean-bag chairs – she knew she had to work there. Her father Andy told Business Insider that he told Chloe to “get the ball rolling” and send a letter to the tech company to see about a job. The letter begins with “Dear Google Boss” and goes on to make a pretty good case for the 7-year-old. “My name is Chloe and I would like a job with Google. I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics,” she wrote. 7-year-old girl sends 'Google boss' job application, gets a response https://t.co/yVRymKH5qw pic.twitter.com/BxighWhJBg — Fox News (@FoxNews) February 16, 2017 “My dad said I can sit on bean bags and go down slides and ride go-karts in a job in Google,” she continued before adding her love for tablets and robots. “My dad told me to give you an application to get a job in Google. I don’t really know what one of them is but he said a letter will do for now.” Like any good cover letter, Chloe gave herself a boost, saying she does well in class and gets good grades. “My dad gave me a game where I have to move a robot up and down squares, he said it will be good for me to learn about computers,” she wrote. She concluded with: “Thank you for reading my letter. I have only ever sent one other and that was to Father Christmas. Good bye.” Much to their surprise, the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, sent a short response. Andy shared the photo on LinkedIn and it has gone viral. Pichai told Chloe to keep learning about technology and to follow her dreams – from a job at Google to swimming at the Olympics. “I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school!” he wrote. Google has confirmed that the letters between the tech CEO and young girl are real. Chloe’s father said on his post that she is now even more eager to do well at school and work at Google after receiving the letter. “Can’t thank such a busy person enough to take time out to make a little girl’s dream become one step closer, although not sure she’s fully aware that it’ll take more than riding go karts and sleeping in pods to make it with Google!” he wrote.

We got a peek at where doodles come from. Tech Culture by Richard Nieva February 12, 2017 9:00 PM PST @richardjnieva How Google made a Doodle game For Valentine's Day, Google made a game where you play a rolling pangolin looking for love. This is how a team of artists, engineers and designers made one of Google's most complex Doodles to date. by Lexy Savvides 3:40 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Think of Valentine's Day, and the first thing that comes to mind probably isn't wildlife conservation. But that's one of the themes of Google's Valentine's Day doodle, which premiered on the search giant's homepage early Monday. It's one of the most in-depth Google Doodles the company has ever created and includes an interactive video game. It took about a year to develop and involved a six-person team of animators and engineers. The doodle stars two lovestruck pangolins, scaly mammals native to Asia and Africa that look like a cross between armadillos and anteaters. Google notes in the game that pangolins are the most poached and trafficked mammals in the world. The game also includes a link to a World Wildlife Fund page, which invites people to donate to protecting them. Google's Valentine's Day Doodle took almost a year to develop. Richard Nieva/CNET "If they're endangered, they really have to meet," Helene Leroux, the head artist for the doodle, said during an interview at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. "So it was a perfect theme for Valentine's Day." Step foot in the Google Doodle office and you might think you're at Pixar. A large blow-up version of Baymax, the health care robot from Disney's "Big Hero 6," greets you in the hallway. Desks are lined with Star Wars and Batman toys. There are tiny drawers full of sticker versions of past doodles. And most of the desks have Cintiqs, giant tablets artists use for digital drawings. The artwork that stands in for Google's logo has also become a big deal for the company. It's pretty obvious why: For lots of people, Google's search engine is the internet. It's the first place they go online, and that makes the homepage some of the choicest real estate on the web. The first doodle, in 1998, was a glorified "out of office" message -- a Burning Man stick figure that indicated co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were away at the annual festival. Now the Doodle team has 30 people, including animators, engineers and designers. Helene Leroux, head artist for the doodle, said the team chose its main characters from several different species that roll up into balls. John Kim/CNET But unlike animated movies and other creative projects, Google Doodles are fleeting. They go live on the homepage for a day, then are gone. (Actually, all the doodles are archived, but most people don't know that.) Doodles have also become a de facto avenue for the company to react to news. When Prince died last April, Doodlers scrambled to create a Purple Rain design in an hour to honor the singer, the fastest a doodle has ever been made. And on January 30, two days after President Donald Trump signed a controversial executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the Google Doodle celebrated the 98th birthday of Fred Korematsu, an activist who spoke out against the internment of Japanese Americans. Some saw it as a political statement. Google declined to comment on the Korematsu doodle -- or any potential political motivations -- beyond the blog post that originally accompanied the artwork. 48 Our favorite Google Doodles through the years The ecological bent in this year's Valentine's Day doodle was at first unintentional. It began as a design decision for the video game: find an animal that rolls. Runners-up included pill bugs and salamanders. The team originally settled on armadillos for the two main characters. But they wanted the game to feel more global, and worried armadillos might just invoke images of Texas and the Southwest. So the pangolin it was. The game is a side-scroller, like Super Mario brothers or Sonic the Hedgehog (in fact the game has striking similarities to Sonic, though the game's lead engineer said he's never played the Sega classic). In the game, available on iPhones, Android phones and desktop computers, you're a pangolin trying to woo your mate. You need to travel to four different countries, including Ghana and the Philippines, and collect various things to help you with your budding romance. In one level, for example, you collect flowers for a bouquet. In another, you gather music notes to write a song. They're like coins in Super Mario and rings in Sonic. So after almost a year of work, how does it feel for a doodle to finally premiere, and then vanish from the homepage a day later? "It's all this excitement, and then, nothing," said Jordan Thompson, head engineer for the doodle's video game, standing at his desk in the studio. A few feet away from him is a poster of a doodle inspired by artist Salvador Dali's painting "The Persistence of Memory," with two melting clocks standing in for the O's in Google. "It's both exciting and terrifying because you have to get it right," he added. "The first time." It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?

The Mountain View advertising broker told us it is indeed moving a number of employees from Access, the branch of parent company Alphabet that handles Fiber. The workers are not being laid off, but rather are going to take jobs at other parts of the sprawling organization, we're told. Overseeing the slimmed-down Access and Fiber will be telco industry veteran Greg McCray, who takes over the CEO role that has sat vacant since last October when Craig Barrett stepped down from the job. "Google Fiber has been instrumental making the web faster and better for everyone — something I’ve been passionate about my entire career," McCray said. "I’m thrilled to lead Access as we continue in our mission to connect more people to abundant access, on networks that are always fast and always open." The Chocolate Factory insists this reassignment of staff not a sign it is further pulling back on its ISP ambitions. At one point, Google wanted to build a brand new fiber service in the US. Now it's looking at cheaper and less ambitious ways of piping connectivity to them. For example, Google just gobbled up Webpass, which sets up building-to-building microwave networks to provide broadband. This avoids having to dig up streets, run cables everywhere, and so on. In other words, it's totally not giving up. It's just frozen its fiber expansion plans, moved staff, and now mulling providing wireless broadband. Who would have thought that building and maintaining underground fiber networks in America would be difficult and expensive? "Google Fiber remains committed to our customers and cities. We want to bring Google Fiber to customers faster, so we’re focused on making deployment more efficient and less intrusive," a Google spokesperson told El Reg. "We’re thrilled that Greg has agreed to join as CEO, to drive this innovation and to grow the business." In the meantime, US telcos will no doubt once again claim the move as a win for the established broadband players who have long seen Google as a nuisance to their own fiber networks and a potential threat to healthy profit margins in many major cities. ® Tips and corrections 12 Comments More from The Register Google fibre: Subs up, Revenue up, expansion over Access CEO asks Google Maps for nearest exit 7 Comments FBI-baiter Barrett Brown gets five years in chokey plus $890,000 fine Hack welcomes free food and chance to report on penal system 48 Comments Intel chief takes helm at WLAN chip maker Atheros… NOT Craig-er vs. Craig-er Discovery on countdown for Thursday launch 'In good shape' for 39th and final flight 9 Comments Discovery team grapples ISS module Robotic arm shifts orbiting outpost extension 3 Comments Qualcomm gobbles Atheros, arms self for coming tablet wars Wireless boom set to keep on booming Whitepapers Overcoming the Obstacles to the All Flash Datacenter The top 6 challenges that can slow your adoption of all flash technology, and show you how to overcome them.

Users can simply tell the speaker to order items — diapers, paper towels, or trash bags, for example, and get delivery from any of dozens of participating retailers. “If picking up paper towels or stocking up on coffee is on your list, consider it done,” said Google Assistant product manager David Wang in a statement. “To help you keep up with your busy schedule and shop for the things you need, we’re introducing shopping with your Google Assistant on Google Home.” The service ties in with tech giant’s delivery arm Google Express, whose US retailers include Costco, Whole Foods Market, Walgreens, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond. Consumers can add payment information to their accounts to enable voice-activated shopping, which is a feature on Amazon’s devices powered by the digital assistant called Alexa. Wang said: “Today is just the beginning of what’s possible for shopping with the Google Assistant. Over the coming months, we’ll continue to add new features and enable purchases for other apps and service.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: Amazon's AlexaGoogleTech You may also like ‘Nigeria hit by 2,175 cyber-attacks in one year’ 5 hours ago  Technology Internet solutions, Accuris launch pan-African WiFi network 5 hours ago  Technology Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods 1 day ago  Technology Latest South Korea's Hanjin Shipping declared bankrupt 24 mins ago  Business News Cameroon’s coach Broos, Siasia apply for Bafana Bafana job 40 mins ago  Sport Samsung heir arrested in corruption probe 56 mins ago  World Pakistani pair set to hang in Singapore for murder 1 hour ago  World Ambode, others to attend The Guardian’s cyber security conference 4 hours ago  Nigeria More   Communication PoS transactions drop in January by N16bn 5 hours ago   CWG to offer infosys finacle on cloud to Nigerian banks 5 hours ago   FG to reposition economy using ICT 5 hours ago   Lagos to set up 500 training centres for codelagos 6 hours ago   Niger signs N300m contract to digitise radio station 6 hours ago   Top News Nigeria Africa World Metro Opinion Editorial Columnists Cartoons Business Appointments Business News Business RoundUp Industry Aviation Capital Market Communications Energy DrillBytes Maritime SweetCrude Infrastructure Money Technology Gadgets Telecoms Social Media Technology Sport Football Boxing Athletics Tennis Golf Arts Arts Art House Artfolk Revue Film Literature Music Theatre Visual Arts Features Policy & Politics BusinessAgro Education Executive Motoring Executive Briefs Focus Friday Worship Law Media Science Youth Speak Property Environment Mortgage Finance Real Estate Urban Development Guardian Woman Entrepreneurship GW Fiction Personality Issues WIMBIZ Saturday Magazine Youth Magazine Just Human Life & Style Love & Life Transition Travel & Tourism Celebrity Brand Intelligence Gardening Weekend Beats Sunday Magazine Ibru Ecumenical Centre Campus CityFile News Feature Living Healthy Diet Living Wellbeing Newspeople Aspire By Zenith Guardian TV News Opinion Fashion Sport Entertainment Science & Tech GTV Exclusive Guardian Life Home Lifestyle Showbiz Trending LS Diaries On The Cover The Guardian Home About Us Advertise With Us |     Powered by Ventra Copyright © 2017 Guardian Newspapers.

We get a peek inside the Loon lab. Tech Industry by Richard Nieva February 16, 2017 2:11 PM PST @richardjnieva The machinery for Alphabet's Loon balloons needs to be able to withstand a beating from the elements. James Martin/CNET Along the fringes of Google's Silicon Valley headquarters, in a nondescript, beige-bricked building named "The Rails," a few guys wearing shark slippers stand in a dark room on a long table that looks like a glowing runway. They are meticulously examining what look like long, clear trash bags. They're actually pieces of large balloons, and the workers are scrutinizing them for stress and damage. (The shark slippers are so they don't damage them further.) The balloons are the cornerstone of Project Loon, Google's attempt to connect remote populations to the internet by beaming down Wi-Fi from balloons flying way in the stratosphere. They essentially serve as flying cell towers. On Thursday, the company invited a handful of reporters on a quick tour of the lab where the machinery for the 40-foot-tall balloons is made. (Photos and video recordings were prohibited, though.) Workers in Google's forensics lab inspecting the balloons in December. Google The scene underscores one simple but obvious thing: Balloons floating through the stratosphere are unpredictable, and anything can happen to them. Alphabet, Google's parent company, said it found a way to make the balloons a little less unpredictable. It's using artificial intelligence to help improve the balloons' navigation algorithms. That means they can better control a balloon's ability to loiter in place instead of drifting off. Now fewer balloons can be clustered around a specific place where people need internet connectivity. So instead of scattering hundreds of balloons across the globe, the company can send 10 to 30 balloons to beam Wi-Fi to a smaller region. Another benefit is they don't have to waste the technology over oceans, where there aren't any people. "We've been working to apply more and more machine learning to essentially make the balloons smarter," Astro Teller, head of X, which handles the company's ambitious moon shot projects, said after the tour. The 46-year-old scientist, sporting a salt-and-pepper ponytail and goatee, made his presentation while on Rollerblades (a favorite mode of transportation for Google's co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.) That's allowed Loon to keep costs "flat," though Teller wouldn't give specifics about costs. 'Keep flying' Loon is still in the testing phase. Last year, X, which developed Project Loon, announced it was working with the Indonesian government to try to bring the balloons to that country, but it still hasn't begun a pilot with real users. Alphabet's business model is to partner with local telecommunications companies that use Loon's technology, instead of dealing with consumers directly. Teller hopes to begin a pilot test within the next few months, though he doesn't know yet where it will be. Almost 4 billion people still don't have access to the Web, according to the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency. Changing that could have staggering implications for emerging countries. The internet could give rural villages video access to remote doctors and classrooms, for example. It could even help break the cycle of poverty, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, by allowing the rural poor to send and receive money right from their phones. Google's not the only Silicon Valley giant set on bringing the internet to the masses. Facebook has a similar project it's testing. They're using a drone called Aquila, with the wingspan of a Boeing 737, to blanket the earth with Wi-Fi signals. Astro Teller, head X, is in charge of Alphabet's most ambitious projects, or "moon shots." James Martin/CNET For those tech giants, this isn't just about altruism. It's good business. The more people they can get online, the more people they can persuade to use their services -- like search, maps and YouTube for Google, and WhatsApp, Instagram and, well, Facebook for Facebook. More people for these free services means they're able to collect more data to woo advertisers. The lab tour comes as Alphabet is facing increased scrutiny over its moon shots, the company's name for big, ambitious projects. Over the past few months, a number of moon shots have been shut down or scaled back. In October, Alphabet said Fiber, an attempt at supercharging internet speeds, would pause expansion, though it will continue operating in the eight cities where it's already in place. And on Wednesday, Alphabet reportedly named a new leader for Access, the division Fiber is a part of, though "several hundred" workers will be switching back to work at Google, according to Bloomberg. (I'm still waiting on an answer on that.) Alphabet has also reportedly scaled back its drone operations. The aircraft were originally supposed to be other ways the company could spread internet access to remote regions. Instead, it's reportedly focusing more on drones for deliveries, like shuttling pizza and groceries to consumers. As for Loon, it still has a long way to go. "The whole global connectivity problem? Definitely not solved," said Sal Candido, the engineer responsible for the balloons' navigation software. "Loon? Definitely not solved either." "But we're going to keep testing," he adds. "We're going to keep flying." It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter.

By Tom Foremski | February 17, 2017 -- 02:30 GMT (18:30 PST) | Topic: Innovation We are in an era of "Hyperscale companies" such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple with limited opportunities for startups warns Sam Altman, head of Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's influential investment group and educator. In his 2017 YC Annual Letter Altman wrote: "We're now in the era of hyperscale technology companies...Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have powerful advantages " "I expect that they will continue to do a lot of things well, have significant data and computation advantages, be able to attract a large percentage of the most talented engineers, and aggressively buy companies that get off to promising starts." This situation "is unlikely to reverse without antitrust action." His warning was carefully worded because Altman knows that advocating for government intervention is unpopular in Silicon Valley. He adds some balance and points to opportunities for startups where these hyperscale companies "are naturally weaker." He says that most startup founders and investors do not fully understand hyperscale's "powerful advantage." Foremski's Take: [I'm a big fan of Sam Altman, the 31-year old head of Y Combinator group after moderating his presentation at the excellent Startup Voodoo in St Louis.] It's good to see someone as influential as Sam Altman raising this issue because it is a topic I've been writing about for nearly three years: Scale versus innovation: The peril to Silicon Valley's future | ZDNet. We continue to see massive late stage VC deals where the race to scale fastest and become the largest is the primary goal over any consideration of other values. It's because in digital economies the first company to scale has the potential to push nearly everyone else into the margins very quickly. In traditional markets a company would expand by establishing offices or stores in new regions and countries - a multi-year process that gives competitors time to respond. But in digital markets a well-funded competitor can quickly scale to a dominant global position in weeks. Scaling is not very interesting but it's how you win in digital markets. However, scaling even at hyperscale levels is not illegal. Anti-trust punishes illegal business practices. Silicon Valley used to celebrate great ideas and extraordinary achievements rather than scale. Fortunately, Sam Altman is still motivated by great ideas and the potential benefits to humanity of "the most significant technology revolution in human history." "It's an exciting time to do what we do."

The apex court ordered all companies to immediately constitute in-house expert bodies to identify and block keywords indicative of sex determination. An apex court bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra observed that tech giants Google India, Yahoo India and Microsoft India were not honouring the Indian law by allowing online advertisements on sex determination tests, to which the companies responded and stated that they are complying with all laws. “Google India, Yahoo India, and Microsoft India need to be more responsive. Earlier also, there were several examples of foreign jurisdictions banning similar content, so why not in India. They have not shown a proper attitude, by claiming that even content on illegal issues such as murder, rape cannot be blocked,” the apex court bench said. The Centre has been directed to set up a nodal agency within a week to keep watch on these internet giants and take appropriate steps for removing offensive advertisements.

Chloe Bridgewater from the town of Hereford in England was so fascinated with her tablet and the idea of robots that she decided to apply for a job at the global tech giant. She listed out her computer skills as well as an interest in a workplace that had bean bags and slides in her letter addressed to ‘Dear google boss’. “Thank you so much for your letter. I’m glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology,” Pichai wrote back to her. “I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to – from working at Google to swimming at the Olympics. I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! 🙂 All the best to you and your family,” he noted. Chloe’s letter was shared with ‘Business Insider’ by her father Andy, who described the response as a great confidence boost. The schoolgirl’s fascination with Google began recently when she asked her father where his ideal place to work would be. Andy currently works in sales for a refrigeration-system parts manufacturer. “And I said, ‘Oh, Google would be a nice place to work’,” he said. When Chloe decided she wanted to work there, too, her father encouraged her to apply and “get the ball rolling”, he said.

The online archive, which spanned millions of digital pages covering roughly 120 years of local history in city newspapers, had been available at MPL since 2009 through the Google News Archive. The database was removed without warning, leaving researchers, genealogists, and other library patrons in the lurch. But Chris Stegman, who took over as Milwaukee Journal Sentinel president in June, said the digital archive’s disappearance was nothing more than an unfortunate mix-up caused by a switch to a new computer system at the newspaper, which was purchased by the Gannett Corporation in April. “That’s hopefully going to be resolved soon,” he said of the archive’s removal, adding that he could not pinpoint a more precise date for its return. Google will no longer host the online material, Stegman added. “The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has a partnership with NewsBank to develop and maintain a digitized, permanent collection of our valuable archival information,” Stegman wrote in a September 14 e-mail to LJ. “This is a massive development project involving digitizing millions of pages of microfilm. Once completed, NewsBank will provide the archive service to our newspaper and community, including the Milwaukee Public Library.” He continued: “NewsBank and the Milwaukee Public Library are in discussion to establish the business terms for this service. The library currently has a no-fee trial of the sample collection; library patron access to the archive is subject to further negotiation and agreement between NewsBank and the library.” Loss left a gap Paula Kiely, MPL’s director, said the sudden loss of the archive caused no small amount of consternation for some MPL patrons, who were using it as a valuable research tool. “I imagine it’s like losing your hard drive,” she said, adding that library officials had no previous information as to when, or if, the archive would return or why it went away in the first place. “For some, the resource affected their work lives; for others, a connection with their families. Some have indicated that research they’ve done over an extended period of time and bookmarked—for some, hundreds of articles—has been lost to them. We hope when full access is returned that these bookmarks will also be restored.” Cathy Markwiese, MPL’s metadata librarian, said she tried diligently after August 16 to contact Google seeking an explanation for the archive’s removal, but made very little headway. Google’s press office did respond to LJ’s separate inquiry. “Google just hosted the content and the Milwaukee Journal requested the removal because they will soon be offering the archive via their own product,” wrote Maggie Shiels, a corporate communications officer with the Mountain View, CA, tech giant. Content contribution There’s another reason why MPL officials were alarmed to see the Google content vanish: The library had donated almost a third of the source material used to construct that archive in the first place. In 2009, when Google began digitizing microfilm and other perishable sources to create the newspaper database, the company found it lacked a significant amount of Milwaukee material. MPL, it turned out, had a large trove of much-needed microfilm, Kiely said, and the library board voted to turn it over free of charge in the name of building a modern sustainable online resource. Markwiese said that contribution of “master film” amounted to about 30 percent of what Google would eventually offer in its Milwaukee newspaper archive. This included Milwaukee Journal pages from 1910–20 and the Milwaukee Sentinel from 1837–1909. Those now-defunct dailies merged in 1995 to form the Journal Sentinel. A costly competitor The recent disappearance of that Google archive proved puzzling to MPL officials for another reason. For months, they have been wrestling with whether or not to buy a digital newspaper database from Florida-based NewsBank. The Journal Sentinel has been working with NewsBank for the last year or two to build a brand new newspaper archive. MPL officials have already been provided with large samples of this online material (which the library has not made available to patrons), Markwiese said. The librarian readily concedes the new archive has fewer chronological gaps, offers easier-to-read images, and is generally more user-friendly than the older Google product. It’s also much costlier. In May, NewsBank quoted its prices: The full menu of the new Journal Sentinel archive options would cost almost $1.5 million, Kiely said, although there are more inexpensive options that provide less online material. The library would also be charged an annual 1 percent network-hosting fee, with that amount scheduled to rise after three years. That price, Kiely added, is “out of reach” for the library right now, although talks with NewsBank are continuing. Chuck Palsho, president of NewsBank’s media services, said a company representative will visit Milwaukee in September to discuss the newspaper archive and help brainstorm for ways MPL can secure the necessary funding. “This is a very high-demand product,” Palsho said. “The challenge is more in the fundraising.” Kiely said she has engaged in talks with some Wisconsin state officials about “broader strategies” to make such a purchase possible, although it’s too early to tell if the state may be willing to provide any type of grant. MPL already subscribes to some NewsBank content, including a database of Journal Sentinel material from 1990 to the present day, and America’s Obituaries & Death Notices, a popular genealogy resource. But the expanded newspaper archive would not be another subscription; MPL would own that content outright. Added Markwiese, “I think we’re living in a capitalist society. They (NewsBank) saw a need. They have a product. They charge what the market will bear.” Markwiese said MPL’s annual materials budget is about $1.8 million (which covers, among other things, database subscriptions), so spending almost $1.5 million of that on the NewsBank digital archive was not feasible. Palsho, for his part, said the archive is not intended for sale as a materials purchase. He said it’s intended as a capital expense to be covered through grants or other outside donations. Prior to the newspaper’s statement that the library would still receive free access, national media Slate’s Future Tense had picked up the story of the Google takedown and proposed NewsBank replacement. There was even a petition started at MoveOn to restore the Google archive.

Why bother going outside even for essential supplies when you can do it all from home and have them delivered to you. Even better, you can do that without even lifting a finger. Although we’re probably still decades away from computers that can read our thoughts (which would be frightening), Google is offering the next best thing: shopping by voice using Google Assistant on the Google Home via Google Express. Shopping by voice is, of course, something that rival Amazon Echo has long had but, to be fair, that is Amazon’s core competency and one of the Echo’s initial, and very limited, feature set. Google isn’t exactly known for its Express shopping service, but that could soon be changing with this Google Home integration. To get started, you just need to add your credit card and delivery address to the Payments settings of the Google Home app. Once that’s done, you can simply ask Google to order your stuff, from toiletries to food supplements to, well, food. Unlike other voice-activated assistants, there is no app to install or enable with Google Assistant. Google just rolls out the feature and it’s ready. The Google Home shopping feature is, of course, limited to participating Google Express retailers, which currently number a bit over 50 spread throughout the country. Until April 2017, Google Home owners won’t have to worry about service or membership fees when shopping via Home, though Google doesn’t yet detail what happens afterwards. Google’s voice-activated smart speaker went off to a slow start but has quickly picked up the pace in integrating new features via Google Assistant. It still doesn’t have as much as Alexa, though Amazon has had a large head start. Both Google and Amazon are now tipped to be considering voice call capabilities to their smart speakers, though that could take a far longer time to happen considering the privacy concerns.

Chloe Bridgewater wrote a letter addressed to "Google Boss." CNN reported that her dad, Andy Bridgewater, was so amused that he posted a photo of the letter to LinkedIn, as well as a kind gesture from Google CEO Sundar Pichai. >> Read more trending stories >> Need something to lift your spirits? Read more uplifting news CNBC reported that Bridgewater wrote the following message with the LinkedIn post: "After seeing images of Google offices with their bean bags, go-karts and slides my 7-year-old daughter decided to write to Google to see if they would give her a job," Bridgewater wrote. "My name is chloe (sic) and when I am bigger I would like a job with google," she wrote in the letter. "My dad said I can sit on bean bags and go down slides and ride go karts in a job in google. I like computers too and have a tablet I play games on. My dad gave me a game where I have to move a robot up and down squares, he said it will be good for me to learn about computers," she wrote. "My dad said he will get me a computer one day. I am 7 years old and my teachers tell my mom and dad I am very good in class and am good at my spelling and reading and my sums. My dad told me if I carry on being good and learning then one day I will be able to have a job at google." After sharing information about her sister's interests -- she likes to play dress-up -- Chloe ended her letter by thanking the reader and mentioning that the only other letter she has sent was to Santa Claus. Business Insider reported that Pichai responded to the letter, thanking Chloe for writing and encouraging her interest in technology. "I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to…I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school," Pichai wrote. Bridgewater thanked Pichai for taking the time to write back to his daughter. © 2017 Cox Media Group.

By Tas Bindi | February 17, 2017 -- 01:45 GMT (17:45 PST) | Topic: Start-Ups Image: Relax VR The early promise of virtual reality (VR) was vast: We would be transported to new worlds and live in alternate realities. While scientists and programmers have been investigating the possibilities of VR since the 1960s, it's only in the last few years that the technology started to gain mainstream traction, with VR applications spanning from education to real estate. Australian startup Relax VR is looking to bring VR into high-pressure corporate environments to relieve occupational stress -- a significant contributor to mental and physical illness, as well as lack of workplace productivity. Founded by Eddie Cranswick and Sourabh Jain in January 2016, Relax VR is a mobile meditation application compatible with Google's Cardboard and Daydream, as well as Samsung's Gear VR headsets. Latest Australian news ​NAB to create new digital platform for healthcare ​ANZ says Apple Pay, Android Pay instrumental in Q1 customer acquisition NBN changes CVC pricing model from industry average to RSP average ​Australian government to review its AU$6.2b annual IT spend Telstra cites 'intense competition' after profit drop to AU$1.8b The application, which was launched in the iOS and Android app stores in Q2 2016, virtually transports users to tranquil locales of their choosing -- from beaches in Portugal to the Great Ocean Road in Australia -- and immerses them in 360-degree videos. A soothing voice is overlaid onto music to guide the user. The goal of the application is to allow users to divert their attention inward and teach them to self-manage their stress. Cranswick, who is based out of Fishburners' coworking space in Ultimo, Sydney, told ZDNet that immersion and presence play an important role when combining meditation techniques with virtual reality for stress management. As such, delivering the right user experience from the moment the user opens the application is paramount to Relax VR's efficacy, Cranswick said. The startup recently appointed Madrid-based clinical psychologist and VR researcher Ivan Alsina Jurnet as its chief scientist to conduct research and measure the real-world impact of Relax VR. Jain, who is a yoga and meditation teacher, said the evidence collected by Jurnet will be core to capturing the corporate market, which is a focus for the startup this year. "There's some research that indicates VR is actually more effective at relaxation than traditional cognitive behavioural therapy. It's a great tool for relaxation and we have science to back that up now," Jain said. Cranswick noted that selling to corporates is very different to selling to consumers. After the initial discussion, it can take months to progress through the approvals process, which can be challenging for startups taking the B2B approach, he admitted. But the B2B approach is particularly lucrative for the Relax VR, the founders said. In 2016, the startup was focused predominantly on consumer adoption, but is now in talks with corporations about integrating Relax VR into their employee wellness programs. Pilot programs are currently being organised, though the founders could not disclose further details at the time of speaking to ZDNet. "We're looking to deliver a structured relaxation program that employees in high-stress environments can sign up to. Corporate wellness is something that we think is a very valid use case for Relax VR," Cranswick said. "But we need to approach it the best way possible. In B2B, it's very important to provide something that's evidence-based, to make sure we've got data to back our [proposition]." In addition to seeing consumer adoption across a range of global markets outside of Australia including the US, the UK, Germany, Japan, and South Korea, Jain said Relax VR has captured the attention of massage chair manufacturers that are looking to integrate VR headsets to their chairs, as well as companies servicing hospitals. "We're keeping an eye on how VR is used in hospitals for patient care, especially in the US because hospitals there are generally more advanced when it comes to technology adoption. Once virtual reality headsets are rolled out in hospitals, there will be a massive opportunity for us," said Cranswick. "It's a great use case, because we'd be able to transport people confined to their beds -- and in many cases, in a lot of pain and experiencing anxiety as well -- to somewhere peaceful. Hospitals don't usually provide a good experience so I think VR has a lot of power to keep people uplifted and keep their minds active." Relax VR is not the only company to recognise the potential of virtual reality in health settings. In December 2016, Australian health insurer Medibank launched an immersive VR experience for Australian hospitals on Google Daydream, in collaboration with a group of neuropsychologists at Melbourne-based VR developers Liminal. The "Joy" experience, which was designed entirely in 3D using Google's Tilt Brush, provides hospital patients with a virtual experience to attempt to relieve loneliness and isolation, particularly for long-stay patients with restricted mobility. Victorian-startup Build VR also recently launched its Solis VR unit, a Gear VR handset that features video scenarios to trigger positive emotions for dementia patients, even for those in the later stages who are barely responsive. Solis VR users start in a computer generated atrium in front of a wall with five paintings, with each one reflecting a VR experience. When the user looks at a painting, a 360-degree video begins, which could be of anything ranging from scuba diving, canoeing, or a trip to Bali. The experiences offer a distraction when dementia patients are experiencing boredom or displaying repetitive behaviour. In the future, Relax VR will look to integrate biofeedback systems that measure the physiological aspects that are related to stress, such as body temperature and heart rate variability. By collecting biofeedback changes in real-time, users will have a greater understanding of not only their stress patterns, but also the impact Relax VR is having on their stress patterns over time. Image: Relax VR "I'm quite excited about seeing where wearables can be integrated into the experiences. Being able to measure stress indicators and providing that data to users would give them a holistic picture of how the relaxation is affecting them over a period of time," Cranswick said. While Relax VR is not the only meditation application in the VR world, Jain and Cranswick believe their competitive advantage is their domain expertise. "I'm a meditation teacher. We now have a clinical psychologist. We have a strong understanding of the content behind relaxation, what helps people relax. Whereas what we see with our competitors is that they tend to have more expertise in virtual reality, and they're kind of jumping on the meditation bandwagon as part of exploring what they can do with VR," Jain said. "[Their products are] generally not as effective in relaxing users, even though they might be more entertaining." Relax VR has been applying to accelerator programs and was accepted into one in San Francisco. However, the terms that were put forth by the accelerator were a little too far from ideal, the founders said. "The whole application process was a good learning experience and it was also good validation for us -- they thought we had potential. But at the stage that we applied, it was better off for us to not take that opportunity at that time," Jain said. Trevor Townsend, managing director at Startupbootcamp Melbourne, believes the excitement towards technologies such as virtual reality will fizzle out this year. "Technologies such as Internet of Things, virtual reality, and augmented reality will start to enter the trough of disillusionment in 2017," Townsend told ZDNet earlier this year. "They have been much hyped, and although our industry will be working long and hard to make the technology vision come true, the overshoot of expectations and the reality of what is actually possible and the difficulties of delivering the vision will dampen the enthusiasm for these topics." Townsend also believes VR and AR will be solutions looking for problems. "Like the ill-fated 3D TV; people will be slow to adopt such technology [and] that means they need to drastically alter the way they consume entertainment. Immersive experiences will arrive, but probably still not in the way we have envisioned," Townsend said. Meanwhile, Cranswick believes the VR space is moving faster than it meets the eye. "I attend a lot of VR events in Australia and I've seen this space move quite quickly over the last year in terms of the general public interest. Enterprise applications of VR are driving a lot of the early adoption, but I think consumer-wise, there have been some big pushes from the likes of Samsung and Google," Cranswick said. "There's still an element of education that's required for the general market to understand virtual reality. It's a very experiential medium, so you need to try it, it needs to be in more retail stores. A lot of companies need to get the demonstrations happening in greater numbers. Getting people to try it is going to drive adoption. Usually, when someone has tried VR they understand it straight away." Relax VR is currently a paid app on iOS, Android, and a freemium app on Samsung Gear VR. The monetisation model for corporate customers will be different, though nothing has been finalised yet. The startup is also planning to raise capital later this year.

In a post on the Pixel User Community, Product Lead Krishna Kumar asks what Google got right, wrong, and how it could improve future devices… A big criticism of Google’s first wholly-made phone has been how similar it looks to the iPhone, although one aspect where the Pixel is notably different is its wedge-shape. Yesterday’s CNET piece does go into particular depth about how avoiding an “unsightly” camera bump was a special area of focus. The wedge-shape ultimately allowed for a larger battery while also allowing the phone to rest flat on a surface. Additionally, we learned that the glass panel on the rear provides “more surface area to receive and send signals,” though Google did not mention why antenna lines are then still required. Noting the tradeoffs in any design, the Pixel Product Lead ends the post asking several questions of owners. Specifically, “What do you hate about it?” and “What would you like to see us improve?” Hopefully, Kumar will also be willing to answer other long-standing questions about the design, including why the Pixel has such a large and empty bottom bezel. Be sure to get your concerns and questions into the forum post, maybe they will be addressed in Google’s next Pixel.

Their respective help-bots — Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana — promise consumers one of the most valuable commodities in the world: free time. Thanks to the sudden acceleration of artificial intelligence and advancements in speech recognition and big-data storage, the technology behind virtual assistants is rapidly spreading from phones to cars and homes, and the truly useful helper is approaching fast. The four giants are fighting for the biggest share of a market expected to grow to $12 billion by 2024. “There’s a tremendous amount of promise for these agents to help and assist with many different tasks that we face every day,” said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. “The more the agent can help you with, the more value it holds.” The ultimate goal is our own personal genie in a bottle that awakens with a word or touch to liberate us from all our mundane tasks, organize our days and nights, and free us from the stress of lives that have become so terribly busy. But that’s not going to happen quite yet. Today, the aid these virtual assistants provide remains limited. Most users of Google Home and Amazon Echo devices — which host Assistant and Alexa, respectively — stream music, play audio books, and control smart-home devices, according to surveys by San Francisco analytics firm VoiceLabs. Still, the virtual agent’s foundation in AI means the more it learns about a user’s preferences and behaviors, the better job it can do. So while experts predict a handful of firms will dominate in this field — most agree Apple, Google and Amazon will be major players, with Microsoft in a lesser role — they’re split on whether consumers will be served best by one bot, or more. “People want one assistant, they don’t want two,” said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research in San Jose. “You want one assistant, to be very readily available wherever you are.” However, the various assistants will likely end up somewhat specialized in their expertise, with Google’s Assistant, for example, excelling in providing knowledge and managing schedules, and Microsoft’s Cortana leading on gaming, said VoiceLabs CEO Adam Marchick. In a few years, many people will use two or three different assistants, Marchick predicted. The industry stands at a critical moment, because the first highly effective help-bot to get a foothold in a consumer’s home, phone or car will likely stay, creating a barrier to competitors, Marchick said. In order for a virtual helpmate to run your life, it needs to engage with the providers of all the services you rely on, from your calendar app to your Uber ride. Those providers must either partner with the company operating the assistant, or design their app to integrate with the assistant. So Spotify will stream music upon request via Alexa, and Honeywell’s smart-home thermostat, via Assistant, will bump up the temperature 15 minutes before Grandma’s expected arrival. For providers, “if there is a competitive advantage to be gained, then absolutely they will do it,” said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at market research firm Parks Associates. For all the major players, virtual assistants provide important data that fuels the AI that powers and improves them, making both the assistants and the products they live in ever more marketable. For Amazon, Alexa is an enthusiastic purchasing agent for the e-commerce that drives the firm. For Google, Assistant is a turbocharged vacuum for the data the company collects to sell ads targeted directly at users. Underlying the projected expansion of virtual assistants is the “voice first” approach to personal technology, said Brian Roemmele, a Los Angeles tech entrepreneur and expert in voice computing. Voice operation keeps hands free and it’s faster, he noted, because speaking conveys information more quickly than typing. Home or phone? So far, both Google and Amazon have focused largely on home-based assistants. Google’s new Pixel phones host Assistant, but it has an uphill battle because Apple has far more phones equipped with Siri on the market, said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with San Jose market research firm Creative Strategies. The popularity of Amazon’s Echo and Alexa notwithstanding — the company has sold more than 8 million Echo devices since rolling them out in late 2014, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners — most people want their virtual assistant on their phones, Bajarin said. “When you’re driving, that’s critical, or if your hands are busy,” Bajarin said. “The phone will continue to dominate as the vehicle for delivering the virtual assistant.” Putting these robo-helpers into cars’ onboard systems has become a priority for major firms, including Microsoft, which seeks to extend the reach of its PC-based Cortana through the “connected-vehicle” platform it announced this year. In January, Nissan announced it would integrate Microsoft’s platform into its cars. Siri already can be used in a car via a phone or Apple’s CarPlay system, or in cars sold with Siri integration built in. Hyundai is bringing Alexa and Google’s Assistant into some of its cars so, for example, an owner could start their car from their living room. While building the supreme help-bot is clearly a priority for many major tech firms, experts say the software today lacks the knowledge base to take the next big leap: to enable virtual assistants that can predict our needs to serve us better. “Some of it is just raw amounts of data and understanding about how the world works and what humans expect,” Reticle’s Rubin said. Which companies rise to dominance depends both on the capability of their bots and the draw of the gadgets that house them. “The story has not been written on what success is going to be in this space,” Sappington said.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google expands fact-check label for news in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina By Ida Torres - February 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter In this age of information and disinformation, it’s pretty crucial not just for news agencies but also for digital companies like Google to ensure that people are getting the right information, since for a lot of them, the Internet is their only source. Google launched the Fact Check tag to identify which are legitimate stories and bring them to the top of their search results. Now they are expanding this to three more countries: Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. Aside from identifying stories as local, satire, and user-generated, Google also launched the Fact Check label just last October because a lot of online users were getting confused with the proliferation of propaganda articles from all corners of the world. After launching in the US, it then expanded to France and Germany, and now, three more countries have been added to the list. Users in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina will be able to see news articles that have been fact checked when they go to the expanded story box in news.google.com and in their Google News & Weather app as well. For the aforementioned countries that have the Fact Check tag available, they will also be able to see the tag in the news mode in Search. So when you search for certain topics and go to the news tab, the top results would be those that have already been tagged as factual. There are now more than 120 organizations around the world that have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the information that people receive is actually true, as sometimes misinformation can affect lives. Google also announced that they started supporting six new fact check related initiatives, as part of their Digital Initiative Fund. This includes Full Fact from the UK, The Ferret in Scotland, Factmata developed by University College London and University of Sheffield, Compass from Italy, Hoaxbuster Decoder from France, and Leserkritikk. Publishers may also apply to have their work appear with the Fact Check tag by using the ClaimReview schema from schema.org.

Samsung Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, executive editor at The Verge and editor at large of Recode. About a year ago, I wrote a column suggesting what the major tech companies should try and accomplish in 2016. For Google, I said: “It would be pretty great if Chromebooks could, out of the box, run all Android apps — provided that, unlike on the recent Pixel C tablet, the Android apps were able to adapt better to a bigger screen.” I’m happy to report that the first Chromebook designed from the ground up to run Android apps out of the box has arrived, albeit a little past the end of 2016. It goes on sale this week for $450. It’s called the Samsung Chromebook Plus, and it runs on an ARM processor, the same type of processor that powers the vast majority of smartphones and tablets. It was designed in close cooperation with Google. Alas, in my tests of the Plus over the last few days, I found the Android execution frustrating. Google Play The Android app feature is still in beta, not all apps work, and too many of those that do run seem like awkwardly blown-up phone apps, not software that’s tailored for the Chromebook's 12-inch screen. And there are other issues. Of course, the Plus, which has a touchscreen and comes with a stylus, is still a Chromebook. That means it runs the Chrome OS along with Android apps. And, purely as a Chromebook, it’s very nice. Chrome OS, which is basically a browser that runs everything, including web apps, does fine on this model and its ARM processor. But if you’re looking for a laptop-style, bigger-screen version of your favorite Android phone, I can’t recommend the Plus now. Optimizing a large number of Android apps for the Chromebook is “going to be a long process, to be honest,” one Google official conceded, noting the beta label on the Google Play Store for the Chromebook. Samsung A second, very similar, new Samsung Chromebook, the Pro, is due out in April. The only significant difference between the two is that the Pro runs on a low-end Intel processor and costs $100 more. I tested it briefly, and found it to be even buggier in its current, very pre-release state. I won’t say much about the otherwise identical hardware on these two Samsung machines, since I think it’s the Google-driven Android / Chrome OS combo software that’s their key claim to fame. Their screens are vivid, sharp and responsive. As on many laptops, you can rotate the screen around so that the relatively thin, light, 2.4-pound laptop becomes a relatively heavy, thick tablet. The stylus fits nicely in a slot and works well for things like screen capture, taking handwritten notes and annotating images. The overall design isn’t especially sexy or sleek. The keyboard lacks a backlight, and the touchpad is a tad small. In my tests, battery life was just shy of eight hours, even with heavy web and app use and streaming a full-length movie. For a better understanding of the hardware (as well as his own take on the software), I recommend my colleague Dieter Bohn’s reviews of the Plus and the Pro. Android writ large. Um, no. Compared to running apps on a smartphone, or, more aptly, an iPad, the app experience on the Samsung Chromebook Plus is distinctly subpar. There are likely several reasons for this. Even though this laptop uses the same processor family most Android devices use, the apps are running atop Chrome OS. Google deserves credit for making this work at all, but it’s still a bit laggy and buggy. For instance, in one case I ran into, two Android apps on the Plus were open but unusable, because they kept blinking and jumping in front and in back of each other rapidly. This happened while I was on the phone with a Google exec who worked on the project. He said it was a known bug that will be patched this week. And there are other bugs. In my tests, Android apps just crashed or froze multiple times a day on the Plus. Even a hugely popular app like Facebook only loaded into part of the screen with an endless spinning circle in a blank right rail. And Google’s own Gmail crashed when I was attaching a photo to a message. Samsung But there’s a larger, more fundamental problem: Android apps, including Google’s own, are almost never designed to look right and run right on a large screen — even a standard-sized tablet, let alone a laptop. There are two elements to this. One is visual: Many Android apps look like blown-up phone apps. Some, like Google News & Weather and Google Docs, don’t seem to resize for the bigger screen, so they present a relatively narrow column of text swimming in unnaturally large borders. Others, like Facebook Messenger, stretch the text horizontally to fill the space, in a weird way that makes the type tiny. The other is functional: Most Android apps I downloaded to the Plus didn’t use the larger screens to add helpful extra panels or other UI elements, but still had the narrow, cramped UI of a phone screen. This is in stark contrast to the way iOS apps behave on larger iPad screens versus iPhone screens. For instance, on the iPad, Facebook Messenger has two panels — one for contacts and one for conversations. It doesn’t look like the single-column version on iPhones and Android phones — and on the Plus. That’s because Apple has long given developers the tools and the encouragement to do dual (or “universal”) versions of their apps, and its app store installs the bigger-screen versions on iPads. Samsung Google says it is working hard to do this, but it has been saying that for years. The company says it’s optimizing its own apps for the Chromebook and urging third parties to do the same. But, judging from the 20 or so well-known Android apps I tested, this process is just starting. The company conceded it had done special work to make several of its most popular Android apps, such as Gmail and Google Calendar, look and work well. But it also said that it believes most Chromebook users will still use many productivity apps like these in the browser. Another issue: In tablet mode, apps are always full screen. You can’t create the multi-app views or even narrow sidebar views of apps that you can on an iPad or a Windows tablet. Google says this will be possible in a future release. Bottom line If you buy the Chromebook Plus and intend to use it mainly as a Chromebook, I expect you’ll have a good experience. But if you plan to rely heavily on Android apps, you’re basically buying into the start of a journey, replete with odd-looking presentations of familiar apps, bugs and crashes. You can certainly go along with Google and Samsung on this journey, but I can’t recommend that for a mainstream Android lover who just wants things to work right.

People have been eagerly awaiting a breakthrough in voice-controlled smart homes since – well, perhaps since Captain Jean-Luc Picard first settled back in his quarters on Star Trek: The Next Generation and issued the command for “Earl Grey, hot!” to the Starship Enterprise computer. Nearly 30 years later, smart home technology appears to be on the verge of that voice-control breakthrough, as major players including Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft compete to establish dominance in the space. Why now? Credit the Internet of Things, which has emerged as a solid technology foundation for a truly interconnected ecosystem of electronic devices in the smart home. In this ecosystem, voice provides the intuitive interface for easily controlling communications with – and among – all those devices. Whether it’s Amazon Echo, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana or the Siri-equipped Apple HomeKit, voice control is central to the smart home ecosystems that top technology companies aim to build. Before voice, people controlled electronic devices in nascent smart home systems with applications – an app to control the thermostat, another to run the ceiling fan and so on. It’s an approach whose limitations become increasingly obvious as the number of devices grows. Voice transcends the limitations of application-based control. It provides a common point of access to a potentially infinite number of devices, which can then communicate with each other across the Internet of Things. (It’s also gaining ground overall as a technology interface, with Google reporting in February 2016 that voice searches had doubled over the preceding 12 months.) Today, it’s not at all beyond the realm of possibility to imagine waking up in the morning and saying “Okay, I’m up” instead of having to fumble for your phone to silence the alarm, then asking “what’s the weather like?” instead of having to interact with a weather app, then heading to the kitchen – where the coffeemaker has automatically started a brewing cycle because it’s learned over time that’s the point at which you like your first cup of coffee. Or imagine realizing when you get to work one day that you forgot to thaw some chicken for dinner. Your spouse isn’t reachable, but plans on being home by noon. So you can just use your phone to send a voice command to a smart home device: “Ask Pat to put the chicken in the fridge to thaw.” The smart home device will detect Pat’s arrival and pass on the message. The question for companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft is which one will be first to command the ecosystem of devices that make up the voice-controlled smart home – and thereby dominate the space. Each company has its own unique voice capability, so the answer lies in part in who makes it easiest for device manufacturers to become part of their ecosystem – by means of open APIs or other technology for interconnectivity, for example. On the other side of the equation are the device manufacturers themselves, who understandably have little or no expertise in voice technology, which can be specialized and complex. Designers often need help designing the voice control element for devices that reside in a smart home. When these devices are attached to private home networks, they also need help enabling more advanced security features. Bridging the gap between the major players (with their sophisticated voice systems) and the manufacturers (with their limited voice experience) falls to another set of actors in the smart home scenario: semiconductor manufacturers. These companies are the ones that make the processors to enable the integration of complex voice and audio functionality in devices for smart homes. With more than 120 million voice-enabled devices projected to ship in 2021, we’ve got our work cut out for us. Inevitably, you can expect that every major technology player in the smart home space is going to find its footing there. The real issue is which one is going to find it first and seize the market advantage. There may be no way to know now who that’s going to be, but it’s clear what it’s going to take: an infrastructure that’s easy to join, device manufacturers who are eager to join it and processor companies, such as NXP Semiconductors, that can help make it happen.  -- Martyn Humphries is vice president of consumer and industrial application processors at NXP Semiconductors.

According to BBC, Chloe Bridgewater, of Hereford, England, loves computers and tablets. She loves to learn and does very well in school, which is why her dad suggested she write a letter as an application to work for Google. A 7-year-old girl wrote a letter to the “Google Boss” and he replied ever so sweetly https://t.co/Qc7Zn86M93 pic.twitter.com/g7BcoM13iT — BuzzFeed (@BuzzFeed) February 16, 2017 Aside from working with computers, Chloe’s interest in a job with Google peaked after she saw a picture on the internet that showed Google employees sitting on bean bags, going down slides, and riding on go-karts. The seven-year-old little girl had only ever sent one letter before, to Father Christmas, but decided to give it a shot, and penned a letter to Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the position of CEO in 2015. Read Chloe’s full letter below. “Dear google boss “My name is chloe and when I am bigger I would like a job with google. I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the olympics, I go swimming on Saturday and a Tuesday. My dad said I can sit on bean bags and go down slides and ride go karts in a job in google. I like computers too and have a tablet I play games on. “My dad gave me a game where I have to move a robot up and down squares, he said it will be good for me to learn about computers. My dad said he will get me a computer one day. I am 7 years old and my teachers tell my mom and dad I am very good in class and am good at my spelling and reading and my sums. “My dad told me if I carry on being good and learning then one day I will be able to have a job at google. My sister Hollie is also very clever but she likes doll and dressing up, she is 5. My dad told me to give you a application to get a job in google. I don’t really know what one of them is but he said a letter will do for now Thank you for reading my letter, I have only ever sent one other and that was to Father christmas. Good bye. “Chloe Bridgewater Age 7” Much to her surprise, Pichai not only read her letter, but decided to respond as well. Chloe’s dad Andy Bridgewater, who was very impressed with her initiative and entrepreneurial spirit, shared a photo of Pichai’s letter to Chloe on LinkedIn, and said it has motivated his daughter even more to do well in school so she can one day be a Google employee. Girl, 7, Gets Letter From Google CEO https://t.co/Gnv0bkQoub pic.twitter.com/pMbEXr8Cme — newseeuu (@news__eeuu) February 17, 2017 Sundar thanked Chloe for her letter, and said he hoped she would continue to learn more about technology through her love of computers. He also encouraged her to send another job application when she finishes school. Read Sundar Pichai’s response to Chloe’s letter below. “Thank you so much for your letter. I’m glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology. “I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to – from working at Google to swimming at the Olympics. “I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! 🙂 “All the best to you and your family.” What do you think about Chloe’s desire to work for Google?

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Smartwatches LG Watch Style early impressions: The sleeker, subtler Android Wear 2.0 watch Will Shanklin 4 pictures New Atlas takes a first look at one of the first Android Wear 2.0 watches, the LG Watch Style(Credit: Will Shanklin/New Atlas)View gallery - 4 images Android Wear 2.0 is a big improvement over the earlier, more simplistic versions of Google's smartwatch software. Today we got our hands on the smaller of the two flagship watches to launch alongside Wear 2, the LG Watch Style. If the larger of the two new watches, the LG Watch Sport, gave us pause because of its hulking, tank-like size, the Watch Style falls on the opposite end of the spectrum. This is the most Apple Watch-like Android smartwatch to date, meaning it's small, sleek and minimalistic. Google and LG don't specifically say the LG Watch Style is a women's watch, but Google's product page does only picture women wearing it in lifestyle shots. With its narrow (18-mm) band and more compact design, it is among the more lady-friendly smartwatches. With that said, I think this titanium-gray model looks fine on my decidedly male wrist: Consider it a unisex model, and a tamer alternative to the monstrous Watch Sport. What it adds in subtlety, it loses in standalone functionality: Unlike the LG Watch Sport, the Style is a standard Bluetooth watch (like the Apple Watch and most smartwatches) without its own cellular data or GPS connections. While the idea of using your watch without a phone might be appealing to a tech enthusiast, it's such a niche use case for most people (mostly joggers and gym rats) that we don't think the majority of people will miss much by going with the cheaper Style. Another thing it loses, though, is a heart-rate sensor. Considering you can find this feature in quality fitness trackers like the US$150 Fitbit Charge 2, it's disappointing to see this $250 smartwatch skip that fitness fundamental. Ideally, a smartwatch will duplicate everything a fitness tracker does, while adding enough extra incentives to justify its higher cost. While it's an unabashed ripoff of the Apple Watch's Digital Crown, I enjoy having the "rotating power button" on these two first Android Wear 2.0 watches. It makes scrolling through lists, notifications and messages simple and fun, eliminating the need to repeatedly swipe your finger across a tiny display. While the Style has a lower-resolution screen than the Sport, its 299-PPI pixel density still looks very sharp. The 1.2-in display size is also nice, while allowing the watch itself to be much smaller than its bulky sibling. Of course you also get Google's advanced AI, Google Assistant (previously only available in the Pixel phones). For the things I've used it for, it isn't much different from its predecessor (Google Now), but its long-term ceiling is higher. If you don't mind talking to your watch like Dick Tracy, you can get answers to many, many questions without pulling out your phone. We'll have more on the Watch Style in our full review, but if you're like me, you may prefer this minimal and wafery watch over the huge Sport. Unless you're a runner, it's quite possible sleek and small will win out over standalone. The LG Watch Style is available now for $250.

A Project Loon balloon in 2013. Image: google By Brett Williams2017-02-17 00:36:09 UTC Internet access is increasingly being recognized as a necessity like food, water, and shelter — and Google doesn't want to leave anybody out.  Before leaving office, President Barack Obama supported the notion that the internet should be easily accesible, while Canada's government went as far as officially declaring broadband connections "necessary to the quality of life" of its citizens.   SEE ALSO: Google's Waymo self-driving platform shows big improvements But the infrastructure for internet service isn't in place everywhere, making truly universal access impossible at the moment. That's why Google has been hard at work on a project to connect people living in underserved rural and remote regions with the rest of the world online.  Project Loon, which first launched in 2013 as part of the Google X (now just X), has been sending smart balloons up into the stratosphere for four years now with the aim of creating a floating, balloon-powered LTE network. Today, Project Loon's top brass announced a major breakthrough. Astro Teller, X's "captain of moonshots" (yes, that's really his title), penned a Medium post showcasing Project Loon's big development, which he called a "magical, serendipitous" experience. The navigational systems that control the balloons have drastically improved beyond the wildest expectations of the project's engineers — something Teller admits happened totally on accident.  At first, Loon launched its balloons and literally threw caution to the wind, controlling the devices just enough to catch the right air currents to take them on their way. After the team's navigation algorithms improved, flightpaths could be charted more accurately to plan return loops around oceans or continents after the balloons drifted away from their original targets, but it was still too tall a task to keep them in one place.     But early last year, the Loon team noticed a "weird" tendency in some of the balloons: they lingered in one area instead of drifting away on the winds.  This changed everything. When the project launched, the team assumed the balloons wouldn't ever be able to stay in one place. Now, their navigation algorithms had advanced to the point where they might set up consistent, solid networks of balloons that staid put.  This changed everything. Throughout 2016, the Loon team tested the new methods in Peruvian airspace and found their hunch was correct: some of the balloons stuck around in the same place for as long as three months. After repeating their results with multiple launches, the team concluded they had found a way to reliably keep the balloons in one spot, clustering them in groups that "danc[ed] in small loops on the stratospheric winds, over a particular region." The Loon team recovering a downed balloon in Peru. Image: google The team identified three areas of development that helped the balloons' navigation system improve so rapidly.  The altitude control system was much more efficient after updating and streamlining its solar panels and air pumps, which allowed for more maneuvers during each flight.   Since the balloons' algorithms depend on tons of data to develop, reaching a point where simulated flights were just as good as real ones to refine those algorithms was a big step forward, too.  Finally, using a machine learning system to pilot the balloons was key for traversing the unpredictable conditions of the stratosphere.  Relying on real-time maneuvers, rather than a predetermined course, made them way more likely to get to their destination without being blown away.  With the new clusters, setting up a Loon network can be done in weeks, rather than months.  More efficient control systems mean each balloon lasts longer, and less are needed to build a network. That drops the cost, which could make Loon much more attractive to business partners around the globe. Next step: actually testing a network with real-life users in trials, rather than just Loon team members. Google says that will come "very soon," making for a truly world wide web.  BONUS: Forget taxis; Dubai wants to fly you around in passenger drones Topics: accessibility, Google, google-x-lab, internet, loon, LTE, Social Good, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Huawei reportedly developing its own voice assistant By Ida Torres - February 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter While Siri (Apple), Alexa (Amazon), and Google Assistant (well, Google) are still waging battle over which digital voice assistant is the best, the other OEMs are actually thinking of developing their own, instead of just adapting these existing ones to their device. Samsung is reportedly in the final stages of their own product and now the latest rumor is that Huawei is also doing the same for their own smartphones and other devices. This may be good news for its users but bad news for Google. Google has reportedly been trying to get third-party manufacturers to adapt its Google Assistant and pre-install it in their devices. But Huawei, which is the third-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world (just behind Apple and Samsung) is reportedly set to join in the battle of the digital voice assistants. They are still in the early stages, but a team of more than a hundred engineers are already working on it in their Shenzhen offices. And they really want to go up against the “big boys” and not just the minor players. What will give them the advantage particularly in their local market is that this product will be communicating in Chinese. Many Google services are actually blocked in China, so having a really good digital assistant will help Huawei stand out in the already crowded domestic market. They will still continue working with either Google or Amazon for their other markets. Just last month, Huawei announced that they were going with Amazon’s Alexa for their Mate 9 smartphones to be released in the US, which is a blow for Google of course. Currently, the Google Assistant is only available in the Google Pixel smartphones, Google Home, speaker, and smartwatches that will be running on Android Wear 2.0.

Name: Subject: Message: Google’s latest experiment lets you jam on a keyboard with an AI partner Android Development Newsby John Callaham8 hours ago February 16th, 2017 4 254 7 If you are a musician, or just someone who wants to make some music in your spare time, it’s natural to want to play and jam out with a friend. However, you might not have anyone around when that time comes. The Google Creative Lab team says it’s ready to help with its latest experiment called A.I. Duet. See also: Is Google’s Fuchsia OS the key to merge Android and Chrome OS or not? 1 day ago The basis for this experiment is Magenta, an open-source project by Google that was first announced in May 2016. It’s designed to use the company’s TensorFlow machine learning software library to help people create art and music. In this case, A.I. Duet is designed around a virtual keyboard. When you start playing a few notes, the computer is supposed to respond to it with the appropriate melody. You can go ahead and check out A.I. Duet right now on Google’s website. You can simply tap on the virtual keys to get started, and you can use a touchscreen to hit those keys if you have a smartphone or tablet. If you are on a PC, you can use your computer keyboard buttons. Finally, you can hook up a MIDI-based keyboard to your PC to get the full effect. Google has also posted the code created for A.I. Duet as an open-source project on GitHub, in case you want to make it better. The company says that it hope this will allow others to “extend the functionality of A.I. Duet to address even more research questions surrounding creativity and computation”. While this is certainly a small scale effort, it also shows that Google wants to help expand the reach of artificial intelligence beyond just answering questions, like we see with Google Assistant and other voice-based digital AI services.

Users can simply tell the speaker to order items — diapers, paper towels, or trash bags, for example, and get delivery from any of dozens of participating retailers. “If picking up paper towels or stocking up on coffee is on your list, consider it done,” said Google Assistant product manager David Wang in a statement. “To help you keep up with your busy schedule and shop for the things you need, we’re introducing shopping with your Google Assistant on Google Home.” The service ties in with tech giant’s delivery arm Google Express, whose US retailers include Costco, Whole Foods Market, Walgreens, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond. Consumers can add payment information to their accounts to enable voice-activated shopping, which is a feature on Amazon’s devices powered by the digital assistant called Alexa. Wang said: “Today is just the beginning of what’s possible for shopping with the Google Assistant. Over the coming months, we’ll continue to add new features and enable purchases for other apps and service.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Snap co-founder Spiegel inches closer to US$588m payday Zuckerberg envisions Facebook as a ‘global community’ Google adds voice-activated shopping, taking on Amazon Alphabet’s ‘Loon’ internet plan closer to deployment Apple to announce iOS, Mac updates June 5 Focus on Vivo: Chinese smartphone maker known for audio quality, selfies Google brings virtual reality to updated Chrome mobile browser Algorithms: The managers of our digital lives Sony's new 4K Ultra HD TVs, Blu-ray player hit stores in March Apple TV eyes Amazon Fire TV's success Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Related Articles Huawei said to plan own voice assistant for smartphones From Alexa to virtual reality: Highlights of CES 2017 Amazon Alexa virtual assistant shines at CES 2017 Amazon’s Alexa to take the wheel in Ford models China’s Huawei adds Amazon Alexa to flagship phone Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Samsung Hello could be a new competitor set to enter the race, which means we may see a new Smarthome Hub before the holidays. While it hasn’t been available for long, Google Home is already starting to steal some of the Echo’s shine. Amazon doesn’t have anything to fear at the moment, but Samsung may soon shake things up. The Samsung Hello is thought to be an upcoming gadget from the company. A trademark was recently filed with the Samsung Hello moniker, which could mean several things. Given we already know about Bixby, all signs point towards a new type of assistant when you factor in a new patent. The Samsung Hello moniker doesn’t tell us much, but makes a bit more sense when combined with a recent patent. A version of the Samsung Otto has shown up in a patent from late last year which shows a revamped version of the bot. The new model is more rounded and frankly looks like it would belong on a countertop or desk more than the somewhat awkward Otto. As with many patents, it doesn’t mean much as this could be an idea that will never see the light of day. That said, another piece of the puzzle may tell a different tale. A device carrying the model number SM-R210 was recently imported for testing. Nothing is known about that device aside from the fact it has a Camera and Wi-Fi considering it was certified through the alliance. It will also run Tizen, not Android. That leads us to believe it definitely could be the unannounced and previously unknown Samsung Hello Smart Hub. We know Sammy is pushing Tizen and wouldn’t opt for Android on something of this nature. For now, you will want to take this one lightly although the folks at GalaxyClub.nl have done an amazing job of putting the pieces together. It would not surprise us in the least to see Samsung unleash a Smart Hub for the home, and Samsung Hello is a very catchy moniker. via – SamMobile    source: Galaxyclub.nl Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: Elephone Z1 listed with 6GB of RAM for $189 through Crowdfunding Next article Next post: iPhone 8 display will make use of Virtual Buttons Adam Adam is a techie, who loves new gadgets and all things Westeros.

The ambitious girl recently penned a short letter to Google to express her desire to one day work there – and it made such an impression to CEO Sundar Pichai he decided to reply to her personally. Inspired by her father’s work, the eager seven-year-old wrote a touching letter to tell the “Google boss” about her ambition to work at the company. In addition to her interest in computers, the little girl also expressed a desire to work for a chocolate factory and swim at the Olympics. “The most awesome stage” Last year, Facebook's VP of Design thought the TNW Conference main stage was the best she'd ever been on. FIND OUT WHY Here’s the letter Chloe wrote to Google, as obtained by BBC: Credit: Andy Bridgewater / Chloe Bridgewater While it was only her second letter, following a Christmas missive she previously addressed to Santa, Pichai took it upon him to write back. In his adorable response, the Google chief addressed the girl in a thoroughly inspiring manner, complimenting her on her interests in computers and technology, and encouraging her to keep up at her pursuits with the same decisiveness. “I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to – from working at Google to swimming at the Olympics,” Pichai said. “I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :)” Credit: Andy Bridgewater / Chloe Bridgewater Speaking to BBC, Chloe’s father said, “We were gobsmacked, but I don’t think Chloe could understand the magnitude of the reaction she’d got afterwards.” “She’s got a great entrepreneurial spirit,” he continued. “Ever since nursery, she’s always been told in school reports she’s bright, hard-working and polite.” Never be afraid to swim against the current, Chloe!

This time, Google’s latest machine learning system, DeepMind, has learned to respond to stress with extreme aggression. I dunno about you, but that sounds like we just gave computers a fight or flight response. You may recall DeepMind as the computer that bested human Go players for the first time last years. Now, researchers have been using it to explore the limits of game theory — a field of psychology that analyzes how people respond to cooperative and competitive opportunities. The team found that when DeepMind suspects that it’s about to lose, it will switch to “highly aggressive” tactics to either win or maximize damage to its opponents. Researchers ran a simple fruit gathering program in which two versions of DeepMind would compete to gather as many apples as possible. After tens of millions of turns, the team found that as long as there was enough fruit for both AI, there wasn’t a problem. But when things got tight, the AI would try to eliminate one another and steal all the apples. What’s particularly interesting is that this aggression only popped up when Google used more powerful versions of DeepMind. The more powerful the network of computer systems fueling the AI’s algorithms, the more likely they were to use aggressive tactics. “This model … shows that some aspects of human-like behavior emerge as a product of the environment and learning… Less aggressive policies emerge from learning in relatively abundant environments with less possibility for costly action,” Joel Leibo, a researcher on the project told WIRED. “The greed motivation reflects the temptation to take out a rival and collect all the apples oneself.” The good news is that when working with a different game, the team got notably more pro-social behavior out of DeepMind. In a different game, the AI were taught to cooperate with one another for mutual benefit. This shows that the AI can analyze its environment and then create and teach itself the optimal strategy for survival. In many ways, this mirrors what we’ve seen in the real world. The two species closest to humans are Chimps and their slightly smaller cousins the Bonobos. Both live in very close proximity, but for the most part Bonobos are peaceful and solve most of their problems with sex. Chimps, on the other hand, are ruthless, violent, and sometimes cannibalistic. Many evolutionary anthropologists have suggested that this difference is the natural result of resource scarcity. Chimps have to struggle to survive, whereas Bonobos have things comparatively easy. Google suggests that the most important conclusion of the study is how to construct environments and learning scenarios that reinforce cooperation. If we take the right approach and give AI the right priorities, there’s no reason we couldn’t prevent an AI apocalypse. Similarly, it reinforces some modern conclusions about our society — namely that systems like capitalism actively encourage destructive and exploitive tactics. But if you can change the structure of the game we’re all playing, then it’s possible we’ll all be a little more altruistic.

By Priya Joshi February 17, 2017 00:19 GMT Chloe Bridgewater, 7, wrote a heartfelt letter to the CEO of Google asking for a jobAndy Bridgewater A seven-year-old girl who wrote to the chief executive officer of Google asking for a job had a heart-warming reply to her letter. Chloe Bridgewater had been discussing with her father where she might one day work and he showed her images of the famed Google headquarters. Clearly impressed, she decided that she would like to work for the technology giant and penned a touching letter beginning "dear Google boss". "My dad said I can sit on bean bags and go down slides and ride go-karts in a job in (Google)," she said. Expressing her many varied career aspirations, which include working in a chocolate factory or becoming an Olympic swimmer, she added "I like computers too ... and my teachers tell my mum and dad I am very good in class ... My dad told me if I carry on being good and learning then one day I may be able to have a job at Google". "My Dad told me to give you an application to get a job at Google. I don't really know what one is but he said a letter will do for now," she added. To Chloe's surprise, just four days later she received a personal reply from Google CEO Sundar Pichai. "Thank you so much for your letter. I'm glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology," he wrote. "I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to — from working at Google to swimming at the Olympics. "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :) "All the best to you and your family." In her letter Chloe explained that she 'likes computers' and hopes one day ' to get a job at Google'Chloe Bridgewater Chloe's mum Julie told Sky News her face "just lit up" when she saw the envelope with the Google logo on it. "I didn't expect a response at all, it was a complete shock," she said. "It was really lovely for Chloe because she put so much effort into writing the letter. She did it over the course of two days." The letter went viral after Chloe's father Andy Bridgewater posted it on LinkedIn, receiving more than 10 million views, and prompting phone calls for Chloe from Japan, China and the United States. The sales manager from Hereford said his "entrepreneurial" daughter "took it all in her stride." He explained: "We were gobsmacked, but I don't think Chloe could understand the magnitude of the reaction she'd got afterwards." "She's got a great entrepreneurial spirit. Ever since nursery, she's always been told in school reports she's bright, hard-working and polite — we're very proud of her and her younger sister [Hollie, five] is similar," he said.

SUBSCRIBE No more free ride: Wall Street Journal pulls content out of Google’s “First Click Free” program WSJ move might cause other publishers to remove content from Google's program, if it turns out 'Subscription' label doesn't hurt conversions. Danny Sullivan on February 16, 2017 at 1:54 pm More The Wall Street Journal has confirmed to Search Engine Land that it has removed its content from Google’s First Click Free program, a system that allows Google searchers to access a limited amount of news content without a paywall barrier. Dow Jones — which publishes The Wall Street Journal — sent us this statement: We are constantly experimenting with different ways to enhance the digital experience for members. As a continuation of this, the Journal has broadened its test by removing content available through Google’s First Click Free. The test began last month when the Journal removed four sections, resulting in subscription growth driven directly from content. Originally, the Business, Markets, Politics and Opinion sections were removed, Dow Jones said. But on Monday, all sections were pulled, it told us. It also said that it did the required change in Google News Publisher Center to flag these sections as subscription-only. Subscription label suddenly showing, only in Google News Those finding Wall Street Journal content are now getting a “Subscription” label appearing next to its links in Google News, something I did not see happen before I asked about this story earlier this week. Here are two examples of that: However, this “Subscription” label is not showing with regular Google search, as is my understanding should be happening: In either case, anyone clicking on such stories is unable to read them without having a subscription or purchasing one. What “First Click Free” is The Wall Street Journal has been a participant in Google’s First Click Free program for years. The program requires that news publishers allow those who click to their stories from Google’s search results to have unfettered access, for up to three stories per day. The idea behind the program is that Google’s searchers aren’t annoyed by running into barriers while publishers potentially gain an audience that they can convert. Clearly, The Wall Street Journal has decided that it’s working better not to be in the program for significant amounts of its content. Why didn’t subscription labels show before? It remains to be seen if that will continue to be as successful now that the “Subscription” disclaimers are showing. The Wall Street Journal says it did what it needed to do for these to show in Google. However, I’ve never seen them until today. It’s a change that came after I contacted both The Wall Street Journal and Google about why the label wasn’t appearing. If The Wall Street Journal did what it was supposed to, I (and others) would have seen these labels earlier. For those not to appear until now means the publication may have made the change after I asked. The WSJ is checking on this. I was told that there might have been a delay because the “full test” only started earlier this week — which would suggest some limited content was pulled without the WSJ flagging it to Google as subscription-only, as required. It could also be that Google itself only implemented the labels, as required, after I asked. I have asked Google for comment and will update if I hear back. Google has long been lax in enforcing this requirement, especially with The Wall Street Journal, such a prominent publisher with a history of flouting First Click Free rules. Of course, the labels might not change anything. People might continue to click from Google to The Wall Street Journal’s subscription-only stories despite the label — and perhaps continue to convert, as the publication says is the case now. More background reading Here are some of our past articles with more background: WSJ Pulls Back On What Google Searchers Can Read For Free — From 2012, on how The Wall Street Journal quietly pulled content from First Click Free without Google flagging such content as “Subscription.” How Google Fails To Enforce “First Click Free” — From 2014, how Google failed to show “Subscription” labels as it says it should, for subscription content. Google News “First Click Free” Gets Less Free To Appease Publishers — From 2015, about how Google changed its First Click Free requirements so publishers had to share less than in the past. Is It Time For Google To Rank News Content Behind Paywalls Better? — From 2015, my look at how Google might change its First Click Free program to better accommodate publishers, something even more relevant as the WSJ’s change might cause other publishers to shift.

Thanks to an integration with Google's Express online shopping service, you can shop for your everyday essentials, whether its paper towels or vitamins, and order them from participating retailers across the US using just your voice. Saying something like "OK Google, order paper towels" results in Google Assistant placing an order for you, and a Google Express courier delivering the item same-day. Here's everything you need to know about how the feature, including how to set up payments and which retailers you buy from. Google Home Express shopping: How does it work? To get started, say “OK Google, how do I shop?” Due to a gradual rollout, Google said its Google Home Express shopping feature may not always be available. If Google Assistant responds with "try shopping again tomorrow", try again the following day. Set up payments Open the Google Home app, then tap Menu from the Home screen, and verify the Google Account that is listed is the one you used to set up Google Home. From there, tap More settings. Find the section labeled Google Account settings, then tap Payments, and then Get Started. You'll need to agree to Google's Terms of Service. Choose your default payment method. If you have already added a payment method for Google Play or another Google service, you will be able to select that payment method. Otherwise, tap Add credit or debit card to add a new payment method. You'll be asked to choose your delivery address. Again, you can use one listed with a Google service, or you can enter a new address. Once you're done with that, you'll see a list of all Google Homes that are successfully set up. Select which one you want to make payments. Next to each Google Home, you'll see a toggle that controls the Personal results for that particular device, such as your personal information, including payments and other things like email. To allow Google Home to use your personal information, slide the slider to the right. For a step-by-step guide on how to set up payments, see Google's FAQ page. Find and buy items To buy an item, like paper towels, just say “OK Google, buy paper towels.” If you don't specify a store, results will based on your Google Express order history or from other participating stores that carry the item. To buy an item, like paper towels, from a specific participating store, such as Costco, say "OK Google, buy paper towels from Costco" or "Purchase paper towels from Costco" or "Order paper towels from Costco". For now you can order things that cost between $3.99 and more than $100 pre-tax. Right now, you cannot buy fresh produce, perishables, most clothing and accessory items, and furniture. The price you hear includes tax, which is determined by the location of the store. You may be given a few suggestions. When you hear one you like, answer “Yes” to place the order. ​​If you answer “No,” you’ll get another suggestion. If you say “No” a second time, you’ll find the item on your shopping list in the Google Home app. Your Google Home shopping list is saved in your Google Keep account. It is separate from a Google Express shopping list.  If you have questions about your order or need help, contact the Google Home Express support specialists. Track or cancel orders You can double check your order on google.com/express or with your Google Express app. You can check the status and details of your package in your order confirmation email or on your Google Express orders page. You’ll also get an email when your order is on its way. To cancel your order, go to your Google Express orders page, or you can find where to cancel under Orders in your Google Express app. However, once the order has been prepared for delivery, it can’t be canceled. For more information on Google Express orders, see Google's FAQ page. Google Home Express shopping: What is Google Express? Express is an Amazon Prime-like shopping service. It has an iOS app and Android app and is available on the web. It's straightforward to use and looks like any shopping site. After the free trial, a membership costs $10 per month for monthly members or $95 per year for annual members. For non-members, delivery starts at $4.99 per store. Go here to learn more about Google Express fees and plans Google Home Express shopping: Are there any fees to shop on Google Home? You'll see no service fees or store membership fees (like a Costco membership) when ordering with Google Home Express during the launch promo period. That period ends on 30 April 2017. Google didn't offer any details on future pricing or membership fees.  Google Home Express shopping: What retailers are available? You can order from Costco, Guitar Center, Kohl's, L'Occitane, Payless, PetSmart, Road Runner Sports, Sur La Table, Ulta, Walgreens, and Whole Foods anywhere in the US (except Alaska and Hawaii). However, there may be additional stores specific to your area. See the full list of participating stores here. Google Home Express shopping: When will shopping be available? Starting 16 February, you can shop for your everyday essentials on Google Home using Google Assistant. Google Home Express shopping: Where is shopping available? At launch, Google Home Express shopping is only available in the US (except Alaska and Hawaii). There's no word yet on when or if it will come to the UK and Europe. Want to know more?

We get a peek inside the Loon lab. Tech Industry by Richard Nieva February 16, 2017 2:11 PM PST @richardjnieva The machinery for Alphabet's Loon balloons needs to be able to withstand a beating from the elements. James Martin/CNET Along the fringes of Google's Silicon Valley headquarters, in a nondescript, beige-bricked building named "The Rails," a few guys wearing shark slippers stand in a dark room on a long table that looks like a glowing runway. They are meticulously examining what look like long, clear trash bags. They're actually pieces of large balloons, and the workers are scrutinizing them for stress and damage. (The shark slippers are so they don't damage them further.) The balloons are the cornerstone of Project Loon, Google's attempt to connect remote populations to the internet by beaming down Wi-Fi from balloons flying way in the stratosphere. They essentially serve as flying cell towers. On Thursday, the company invited a handful of reporters on a quick tour of the lab where the machinery for the 40-foot-tall balloons is made. (Photos and video recordings were prohibited, though.) Workers in Google's forensics lab inspecting the balloons in December. Google The scene underscores one simple but obvious thing: Balloons floating through the stratosphere are unpredictable, and anything can happen to them. Alphabet, Google's parent company, said it found a way to make the balloons a little less unpredictable. It's using artificial intelligence to help improve the balloons' navigation algorithms. That means they can better control a balloon's ability to loiter in place instead of drifting off. Now fewer balloons can be clustered around a specific place where people need internet connectivity. So instead of scattering hundreds of balloons across the globe, the company can send 10 to 30 balloons to beam Wi-Fi to a smaller region. Another benefit is they don't have to waste the technology over oceans, where there aren't any people. "We've been working to apply more and more machine learning to essentially make the balloons smarter," Astro Teller, head of X, which handles the company's ambitious moon shot projects, said after the tour. The 46-year-old scientist, sporting a salt-and-pepper ponytail and goatee, made his presentation while on Rollerblades (a favorite mode of transportation for Google's co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.) That's allowed Loon to keep costs "flat," though Teller wouldn't give specifics about costs. 'Keep flying' Loon is still in the testing phase. Last year, X, which developed Project Loon, announced it was working with the Indonesian government to try to bring the balloons to that country, but it still hasn't begun a pilot with real users. Alphabet's business model is to partner with local telecommunications companies that use Loon's technology, instead of dealing with consumers directly. Teller hopes to begin a pilot test within the next few months, though he doesn't know yet where it will be. Almost 4 billion people still don't have access to the Web, according to the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency. Changing that could have staggering implications for emerging countries. The internet could give rural villages video access to remote doctors and classrooms, for example. It could even help break the cycle of poverty, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, by allowing the rural poor to send and receive money right from their phones. Google's not the only Silicon Valley giant set on bringing the internet to the masses. Facebook has a similar project it's testing. They're using a drone called Aquila, with the wingspan of a Boeing 737, to blanket the earth with Wi-Fi signals. Astro Teller, head X, is in charge of Alphabet's most ambitious projects, or "moon shots." James Martin/CNET For those tech giants, this isn't just about altruism. It's good business. The more people they can get online, the more people they can persuade to use their services -- like search, maps and YouTube for Google, and WhatsApp, Instagram and, well, Facebook for Facebook. More people for these free services means they're able to collect more data to woo advertisers. The lab tour comes as Alphabet is facing increased scrutiny over its moon shots, the company's name for big, ambitious projects. Over the past few months, a number of moon shots have been shut down or scaled back. In October, Alphabet said Fiber, an attempt at supercharging internet speeds, would pause expansion, though it will continue operating in the eight cities where it's already in place. And on Wednesday, Alphabet reportedly named a new leader for Access, the division Fiber is a part of, though "several hundred" workers will be switching back to work at Google, according to Bloomberg. (I'm still waiting on an answer on that.) Alphabet has also reportedly scaled back its drone operations. The aircraft were originally supposed to be other ways the company could spread internet access to remote regions. Instead, it's reportedly focusing more on drones for deliveries, like shuttling pizza and groceries to consumers. As for Loon, it still has a long way to go. "The whole global connectivity problem? Definitely not solved," said Sal Candido, the engineer responsible for the balloons' navigation software. "Loon? Definitely not solved either." "But we're going to keep testing," he adds. "We're going to keep flying." It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter.

The company's AI assistant will soon be competing with Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. Huawei has formed a team with over 100 engineers in Shenzhen, China which is currently in early stages of development for the new digital smart assistant, according to one of Bloomberg. Huawei’s digital assistant will be aimed at Chinese customers meaning it will communicate in Chinese languages. One of Bloomberg's sources claimed that Huawei will continue to work with Google and Amazon when it comes to providing other services to its phones internationally. The company's own assistant will mostly rival Apple’s Siri on iPhones as most of Google’s services in China are blocked off despite majority smartphone users  are using Android OS. Although Huawei intends to continue working with Google, the company’s endeavor to build its own AI assistant clashes with Google’s plan in convincing other manufacturers to pre-install its own assistant on their devices. Currently, Google Assistant is only available on the Pixel phones, Google Home and Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches. As for Huawei’s commitment with Amazon, the Chinese phone maker previously just released its Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S. last month and it comes with Alexa already pre-installed. The Huawei Mate 9 first launch in China and other Asian markets back in November 2016. Huawei new digital assistant for its smartphones in China will be the company’s second investment in artificial intelligence. Back in October, the company announced that it plans to fund UC Berkeley in a partnership to research deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision, according to TechCrunch. Huawei has proven to be quite ambitious with its future plans. One of he company’s top executives, Richard Yu, stated last month during CES 2017 that Huawei wants to be the number one smartphone manufacturer by 2021.

Roston - Feb 16, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google first announced captions for its Google Video product way back in 2006, and now it is back with a new related announcement: automatic captions have arrived on YouTube. These captions are machine-generated, something made possible in part by YouTube’s existing caption system and Google’s automatic speech recognition technology. With this feature, a much larger number of videos will gain captions, making them accessible to both the hearing-impaired and those who speak other languages (via machine translation). Captions are an important part of YouTube’s service, enabling those with hearing troubles to enjoy the same videos as everyone else. When captions are added to a video, Google’s technology is also able to then automatically translate it into 51 different languages, making them accessible to others who don’t speak the language featured in the video. Adding captions does add extra time to the uploading process, and most uploaders don’t take the time to add these captions. As such, while hundreds of thousands of videos now have captions, the vast majority of YouTube’s library lacks them. Machine-generated automatic captions will change that. If you’ve ever used Google Voice, you’ll be familiar with the company’s voice recognition-based transcription. Google points out that because the captions are automatic, they will at times be less than accurate, though that accuracy will change in time as improvements to the tech are made. If you do prefer to make your own video captions, though, Google is going to make that easier via auto-timing.

We invented plumbing so we didn’t have to carry water. We invented tractors so we didn’t have to break our backs in the fields. We invented air conditioning so we’re no longer uncomfortable in the summer. And now, you are alive to see the snuffing out of another source of misery: Wi-Fi dead spots. For years, we’ve tried to solve this problem with various imperfect solutions like Wi-Fi repeaters/extenders. But they all have downsides, like diminished speed and having to change Wi-Fi network names when you move around the house. But now, there’s mesh Wi-Fi. Instead of one Wi-Fi transmitter too weak to fill your entire home with signal, a mesh system uses a set of them, spaced evenly through your house. The result is a single “mesh network,” a roaming network, that blankets the entire house in good, strong signal. The revolution began a year ago with the introduction of the Eero. After I tested it (my review’s here), I was so exhilarated that I actually bought a set for myself, at the nosebleedy price of $500. Today, every networking company and its sister now offers a similar system. And man, they are great. Because a router out in plain sight offers better coverage than one in a closet, they’re all great-looking. Because we’re human beings and not engineers, they all include phone apps that make setup simple. And because many of us have children, most offer either parental controls (to block iffy websites) or a Pause button for specified offspring (so we can have dinner conversation face to face). This week, I reviewed six of these systems: Eero, Plume, Luma, Google WiFi, Netgear Orbi, LinkSys Velop, and Ubiquiti Amplifi HD. View photos The fruits of my week in networking hell.More About Speed Measurements Each manufacturer touts its routers’ top speed in megabits per second (“867 mbps/sec!”, for example). But trust me: You’ll get those speeds only on the moon. In the cluttered airwaves of a community, among the walls and furniture obstacles of a home, your top speed will probably be less than half the advertised maximum. Move 30 feet away, and it drops by half again. In fact, any of these mesh systems can pass along data faster than your Internet provider passes it into the average American home (54 mbps/sec.). If your concern is transferring files between drives within your home, or if you’re paying for much faster Internet, then consider one of the beefier systems here: The Velop, Orbi, or Amplifi HD. I tested each system by wandering through my house with a laptop running Netspot, an app that builds a “heat map” of Wi-Fi strength. All of them totally blanketed both floors of the house. (I even spot-checked the attic and basement. They had Wi-Fi, too.) View photos Here’s the “heat map,” before and after installing mesh routers. Green is good.More Read More I also did an internet speed test twice per system: in the room closest to the cable modem, and the room farthest from it. Here’s what I discovered. Eero The modules are small and good-looking; the terrific app gives you insight into every aspect of your system. All the key features are here, like guest networks (for visitors—they can access the internet, but not your computers) and individual, pause-able profiles for your offspring. View photos The original mesh WiFi modules, still great.More If you have an Amazon (AMZN) Echo, you can even control your Eeros by voice: shutting off certain kids’ internet access, turning the Eeros’ status lights on or off, or finding your phone/tablet/laptop in the house according to its closest Eero. View photos Eero’s app looks great.More The Eero’s price has not come down in its year on the market, though. At $500 for a set of three, it’s almost goofily overpriced—$200 more than Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Wi-Fi, for example. I’m glad to own it, but it wouldn’t be my first choice today. Speed tests: 57 megabits/second downloading in the closest room, 47 in the farthest. Ethernet jacks: Two per unit. (The pod by your cable modem therefore has only one empty jack for a printer, network hard drive, or other gizmos. I bought a cheap five-port switch box to solve that problem.) Price: Three for $500, 1 for $200. Google Wi-Fi Google’s Eero-like system costs $300 for the set of three. View photos Three Google’s the charm.More It, too, is fast, full-featured, and beautifully designed. (For example, there’s no traditional power brick—only a simple cord with USB-C on the router end and standard two-prong plug on the other.) View photos You can dim or turn off the Google Wifi’s status light.More The app makes it incredibly simple to set the whole thing up. You use your phone to scan a barcode on the bottom of the first pod; after that, one tap is all it takes to set up each additional pod. The app even tests the placement of each unit and lets you know if you’ve chosen wisely. View photos Google’s app is a snap.More Features: You can pause individuals or groups, even remotely. You can control the colorful LED ring around the equator of each unit, although they make fantastic night lights. Voice control is coming soon, Google says. Port forwarding, guest networking, device prioritization (“favor the Roku when I’m watching videos!”): all present. Speed tests: 53 mbps/sec closest, 35 mbps farthest. Ethernet ports: two. Price: $300 for three, $130 for each additional. Luma Feels like a cheap Eero knockoff; minor irritations abound. Do I really have to surrender my phone number just to use my new router? The units are hexagons, but unlike the Eeros, they can’t lie flat, because the power cord sticks out of the back. The setup process goes like this. View photos The Luma’s illuminated during setup.More The app is strong on parental controls and security; for example, you can set up accounts for each kid in your family and specify what kinds of sites they’re allowed to visit (rated PG, R, etc.). And there’s a full list of management features: Alexa commands (“Alexa, tell Luma to pause Casey’s laptop”), gadget prioritization, port forwarding, and guest networks. View photos The Luma app queries you about your home setup.More But the Lumas’ power is on the weak side; a set of three left fading signal at the fringes of the house. View photos To avoid the diluted signal at the outer edges, I would have needed another Luma.More Speed tests: 55 mbps/sec closest spot, 49 farthest. Ethernet ports: two. Price: $400 for three (choice of white, grey, orange, or black plastic), $150 for one Netgear Orbi Netgear’s approach to mesh networking is radical: Only two units to cover an entire big house. Including the front and back yard! How? First, these are big, honking towers, crammed with antennas and power to drive them. (A ring on the top glows in colors during setup to show its happiness with the current signal strength.) View photos The Orbi kit comes with two of these towers.More Second, most routers communicate with your devices on one of two radio bands (2.4 or 5 gigahertz)—but this one uses a third channel exclusively for communications between the two towers. As a result, that channel remains strong enough to drive through ceilings, floors, and walls. Netgear suggests putting one unit right by your cable modem, and the “satellite” tower in the middle of your house, even if that’s upstairs and several rooms away. View photos Only two Orbi units covers the house. Weird.More It works. (The “Mesh routers” heat map shown near the top of this article is the Orbi’s result.) By the way, the Orbi also offers MU-MIMO streaming. (That stands for Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output, but it basically means fast—at least when talking to gadgets that also speak MU-MIMO. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and certain other Android phones do; no Apple products do.) Alas, Netgear’s software engineers aren’t anywhere near as impressive as its hardware designers. The setup instructions are filled with terms like “credentials” and “redirect,” and they make no mention of a smartphone app that could make the process easier. You’re supposed to use a web-browser interface to set up your Orbis. View photos Orbi’s app exists, but Netgear doesn’t want you to know.More When I contacted the company, they told me that there is a setup app—they just forgot to mention it! In fact, there are three apps, each governing a different aspect of the Orbis (setting up guest network, parental controls, etc.). Come on, people. You can do better. Speed tests: 56 mbps/sec closest spot, 52 farthest. Ethernet ports: four per tower Price: $380 for two LinkSys Velop For $490, you get three gorgeous, sculptural white towers, with cables that sneak out of a corner cutout, a physical reset button (instead of a paper-clip hole), and packaging that out-elegances Apple’s. The towers deliver fantastic speed and coverage, thanks in part to a three-band system like Netgear’s for better comms between towers. View photos Air freshener or mesh WiFi router? You decide.More The Velop (pronounced VELLup) also offers MU-MIMO streaming, if you’re scoring at home. All the perks are here: parental controls, guest networking, device prioritization, port forwarding, Alexa commands (“Turn the guest network on,” “What’s my password?”), and so on. The app is, therefore, more dense than on simpler devices, but it’s not hard to navigate. View photos The Velop app is nicely done.More My one beef: it takes a long time to recognize each new satellite as you hook it up. Minutes. Speed tests: 56 mbps/sec closest spot, 52 farthest. Ethernet ports: 2 per tower. Price: Three for $480; two for $350, or one for $200. Plume If you took the concept of mesh routers—multiple transmitters spaced around the home—to its logical conclusion, you’d wind up with Plume. Here, you buy a bunch of super-cheap, tiny routers—the size of night lights, available in black, silver, or bronze—and plug them directly into power outlets, one per room or hallway! (Once you’re about a room away from the nearest Plume, your signal weakens dramatically.) View photos Smallest routers ever.More Setting them up is insanely easy. You don’t even have to introduce them to the network one at a time, as you must the other systems; you can just plug in all six, or all nine, or whatever, and they just work. (If you want to name them, you can: Just hold your phone very close to one of the plugs until it offers its name for changing. Very cool.) View photos Look, ma—no cords!More These pods are so cheap because they don’t contain processors, as their rivals do; all the analysis is done online. As a result, the company says that it takes 24 hours of analysis before the plugs begin to deliver their best speeds. Then, in the coming weeks, they shift bandwidth to the pods that need it most, according to your use patterns. View photos The Plume’s app is super smart.More Here’s the problem, though: Economics. If your home is small enough that you can get by with three Plumes ($180) or even six ($330), you’d save money and complexity by buying a modern, standard, regular router. And if your house is big enough that you need a mesh system, you’ll probably need $600 worth of Plumes—and any of the competitors here would cost a lot less than that. There are no features to speak of, either: No guest network, device prioritization, or parental controls. Speed tests: 52 mbps/sec closest spot, 33 farthest. Ethernet ports: one per unit Price: Three for $180, six for $330, one for $70. Amplifi HD Here’s another fresh take on the mesh system. This time, the three modules aren’t identical and interchangeable. There’s a base module and two satellite antennas. The base is a cube with a color touch screen; tap it to view various network-info screens. (Most of the time, it just shows the time and date.) View photos The Amplifi HD base station has a color touch screen—and sound effects.More The satellites are very cool: the antenna part connects to the power-outlet part with a magnetic ball joint, meaning that you can adjust the antenna’s angle. Note, though, that it can be tough finding spots to plug these things in where they’re not stymied by a floor, a countertop, or a wall. Baseboard outlets are pretty much it—which limits your positioning options (and attracts small children). They’re not exactly fashion accessories, either. View photos Here’s part 2 of the Amplifi system, courtesy of the magnetic ball hinge.More The app is lovely, and gives you access to all kinds of advanced router settings (port forwarding, DHCP settings, etc.)—but doesn’t offer parental controls. Speed tests: 48 mbps/sec closest spot, 44 farthest. Ethernet ports: four on the base unit Price: $350 for the base and two satellites What to buy If money were no object, I’d tell you to buy the LinkSys Velop. These babies look great, they’re absurdly fast, the features are all there, and the software has its act together. A set of three is designed to cover 6,000 square feet of house—far more than the Google WiFi (4,500 square feet), Netgear Orbi (4,000), or Eero or Luma (3,000). (Then again, if your pad is more of a palace, you ‘ll want the Amplifi HD, which says it can cover 20,000 square feet!) But if money is an object—namely, if you object to a $490 price tag—then you can save $200 by getting the Google WiFi trio. The modules are gorgeous and not so ostentatious, and the app offers a smoother setup. Unfortunately, the three-pack of Google WiFi is currently sold out everywhere. If you can’t wait, you can save almost as much money, and still get unbelievable coverage, with the Amplifi HD ($350) or the Netgear Orbi ($380). In any case, if your house’s size or construction stymies any single router you’ve tried, treat yourself. Dead spots are the latest scourge of humanity that we’ve now wiped out.

Currently available in Quite Black and Very Silver, Google says the aim is to offer a “bold and youthful sibling” to those two existing colours. (Google) The Pixel was met with much fanfare when it first launched back in September thanks to its Google Assistant integration – the first Android phone to have such an extensive virtual assistant – as well as unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos and the highest rated camera on any smartphone ever according to one industry body. Google industrial designer Rachael Roberts said: “Launching just in time for London Fashion Week, Pixel Really Blue is the bold and youthful sibling to the Quite Black and Very Silver colours. (Google) “Our goal for Pixel was to create a simple and smart design in a beautifully crafted case and we hope Really Blue will appeal to the fun and stylish fashionistas among us.” Google also confirmed the new limited edition colour would be available to pre-order from Friday and in store from February 24 via EE and Carphone Warehouse.

Word that being able to more smartly guide high-altitude baloons promised to improve coverage while curbing cost came as Loon hit headwinds in some locales where it has been testing the technology. “Out timelines are starting to move up on how we can do more for the world sooner,”  said Astro Teller, who heads the team at the Alphabet unit X, in charge of “moonshot” projects of the technology giant. “We are looking to move quickly, but to move thoughtfully,” Teller told a small group of reporters inside a former Silicon Valley shopping center transformed into a “moonshot factory.” The acceleration was credited to software leaps that allow internet-serving balloons to ride high-altitude winds to ideal locations or loop in patterns that create consistent webs of internet coverage in the sky. “We’ve been working to make the balloons smarter; almost like a game of chess with the winds,” Teller said. He expected Loon to be partnering in coming months with telecom companies to provide internet to “real users,” in a step up from tests done to see how well  the high-floating technology works with networks on the ground. Teller declined to specify where Loon might first be integrated into telecommunications networks providing service to customers. “We are not going to all of a sudden be everywhere,” Teller said. “We intend to be part of an ecosystem — in any country where we are doing testing we would work with a local telco.” Part of the money-making vision for Loon would be to get revenue from telecom operators for extending their reach. Teller said Loon is one of the more mature projects at X and that it “would be a natural state to graduate into its own company” but there were not plans at the moment for that to happen. Grounded in Sri Lanka? The peek inside X lab and word of speedy progress came the same day that the venture to beam the internet to the ground via balloon hit a legal snag in Sri Lanka that could see the project abandoned on the island. Project Loon uses roaming balloons to beam internet coverage and planned to connect Sri Lanka’s 21 million people to the web, even those in remote connectivity black spots. But just a year after testing began in Sri Lanka regulators have been unable to allocate Google a radio frequency for the airborne venture without breaching international regulations.”There are lots of places excited to run experiments with us,” Teller said. “We encourage that, but there are lots of agencies and we need to dot ‘I’s and cross ‘t’s.” He added that Loon planned to “do things by the book” in any country where it is active, using balloons to get internet signals far and wide, while local telecom companies tap into the network from the ground. The first public launch of Loon took place in New Zealand in 2013, when the project was in an early experimental phase. Alphabet recently told AFP that it gave up on its internet drone project, called Titan, about a year ago, to focus its resources on Loon where it saw more promise of success. The economics and technical feasibility of balloons are seen as a more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world to the internet, according to X. Leading online social network Facebook is continuing to develop an Aquila drone for beaming internet connection from the sky. –AFP Tagged balloons Internet Project technology Post navigation Previous Previous post: Security crackdown as Pakistan mourns Sufi shrine victims Next Next post: Kuch Cricket Hojaye – EP 04 Tweet Related Posts Quetta blast kills 9, injures 25 Pakistan has lowest fuel prices in region: Shahid Khaqan UN chief calls 2009 ‘year of climate change’ Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Britta O'Boyle17 February 2017Phones Sammobile / Google Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Samsung will launch its next Galaxy S flagship smartphones in the next couple of months, with rumours suggesting a launch date of 29 March. There has been plenty of speculation surrounding the two devices though, known as the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, giving us an idea of what to expect from the new devices. How will they compare to their current competition? We have put the rumoured specs of the larger S8 Plus up against Google's larger Pixel device, the Pixel XL, to see how they might differ based on the speculation. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus rumours Google Pixel XL review Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus vs Google Pixel XL: Design Rear-mounted fingerprint sensor expected on both S8 Plus should be waterproof, Pixel XL isn't  Both should have USB Type-C and 3.5mm audio jack The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus will no doubt feature a lovely premium build, which will most likely continue with the glass and metal sandwich design found on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. According to the rumours and leaks though, Samsung will be ditching the physical home button on the front of the device in favour of an almost all-screen finish, repositioning the fingerprint sensor to the rear instead. Measurements, especially width, are rumoured to be very similar to the S7 edge, which has a footprint of 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7mm. It is thought USB Type-C will be on board the S8 Plus too, along with the 3.5mm headphone jack which some other manufacturers have been keen to do away with. The S8 Plus is also thought to be retaining the IP68 waterproofing found on its predecessors. The Google Pixel XL measures 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm, meaning it is a little wider than what is expected for the Galaxy S8 Plus and there is no waterproofing on board Google's device. It does offer a lovely premium design though, with metal and glass being the primary materials, though designed in a different way to what is expected from Samsung. The Pixel XL also has USB Type-C and the 3.5mm headphone jack, as well as a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and no physical buttons on the front of the device. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel: What's the rumoured difference? Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus vs Google Pixel XL: Display S8 Plus expected to have curved display Bigger display expected on S8 Plus Shaper display expected on Pixel XL The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is reported to be coming with a 6.2-inch curved display. As we mentioned though, despite the screen size increase, the S8 Plus is said to be sticking with similar measurements to the S7 edge, suggesting a big improvement in screen-to-body ratio. There were a couple of rumours to suggest the resolution would see a bump over the S7 edge, but more recent reports have claimed Samsung will be sticking with a Quad HD Super AMOLED screen, but offer improvements for VR. If this is the case, the S8 Plus will have a pixel density of 473ppi. The Google Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch flat display, which makes it quite a bit smaller than the expected S8 Plus and perhaps not as exciting in terms of design. It too uses AMOLED and it also has a Quad HD resolution however, meaning it will be slightly crisper and sharper on paper than the S8 Plus due to the size difference, with a pixel density of 534ppi. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus vs Google Pixel XL: Camera 12MP rear camera expected on both 8MP front camera expected on both S8 Plus could have OIS and wider aperture There have been several rumours relating to the camera on the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus but the most reliable source claims the device will be coming with a 12-megapixel rear snapper and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. It has been claimed the front facing camera will also feature an iris scanner along with auto-focus, while the rear camera is said to be coming with a new visual search feature. Both are reported to have a f/1.7 aperture, which is the same as Samsung offered on the S7 edge. The Google Pixel XL has a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with 1.55µm pixels and an aperture of f/2.0. It comes with phase detection autofocus and laser detection autofocus but not optical image stabilisation, the latter of which we hope to see on the S8 Plus. In terms of the front camera, the Pixel XL has an 8-megapixel resolution with fixed focus and an f/2.4 aperture. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus vs Google Pixel XL: Hardware Newer, faster hardware expected on S8 Plus Larger battery capacity expected on S8 Plus S8 Plus should have microSD  The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is rumoured to be coming in two variants - one with the Exynos 8895 chip, the other with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. There have been numerous reports regarding RAM, with some claiming 4GB, while others have suggested both 6GB and 8GB. Internal storage is said to start from 64GB and microSD is claimed to be on board. The Google Pixel XL runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip, supported by 4GB of RAM. Storage options comprise a 32GB model and a 128GB model, neither of which offer microSD support for storage expansion. The Galaxy S8 is said to be coming with a 3500mAh battery, while the Pixel XL has a 3450mAh battery, putting them almost on par in terms of capacity but bear in mind the S8 Plus will probably have newer hardware over the Pixel XL, which should hopefully mean improvements in performance. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus vs Google Pixel XL: Software Android Nougat expected on both Pixel XL runs vanilla Android Pixel XL has Google Assistant, S8 Plus will have Viv The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus will probably launch on Android Nougat from the box with Samsung's TouchWiz software over the top. It will come with the Bixby voice assistant, Viv, and it has been claimed there will be an always-visible status bar, as well as the option to connect the handset to a monitor for a desktop view of Android.  The Google Pixel XL runs on the purest form of Android Nougat, meaning there is no extra bloatware or duplication, delivering a clean, seamless experience. The Pixel XL and its smaller sibling will also be the first devices to receive any new future Android updates and they also feature Google Assistant built-in. What is Bixby? Everything you need to know about Samsung's assistant Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus vs Google Pixel XL: Conclusion Based on the rumours, the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus will feature a more exciting design over Google's Pixel XL, along with a larger screen within a similar footprint, faster hardware and a bigger battery capacity, which isn't too surprising given it will be the newer device. The Pixel XL remains a fantastic device though and chances are the Pixel 2 will give the S8 Plus a run for its money whenever it launches. For now, if all the rumours come true, the Pixel XL will be for those who want a smooth, pure Android experience, while the S8 Plus will be for those after design and the latest hardware. You never know though, things might sway in the Pixel XL's favour when the official specs of the S8 Plus are revealed so stay tuned. Google Pixel 2: What do we want to see?

That means that Project Loon, which now falls unde Alphabet’s X subsidiary, will bear the brunt of the responsibilities and expectations. Good thing, then, that the folks behind Loon have stumbled upon a method that allows these Internet-bearing balloons to linger over an area for longer periods of time. The trick to Project Loon’s Internet delivery service is to have a continuous stream of balloons riding wind currents to keep afloat as well as traverse the world. When one balloon leaves the area, another quickly takes its place. The problem with this system is that it needs a continuous stream of balloons, which isn’t exactly a scalable solution. Luckily, the team serendipitously came across an alternative. They noticed that balloons tended to linger over certain areas far longer than they estimated. Adjusting their algorithms and improving their navigation system, Project Loon was able to make that a more consistent feature rather than an accidental one. In effect, this meant that Project Loon could start deploying these balloons in clusters that could stay in the same area for months at a time. And when one or two balloons needed to travel out of that area, another would take its place in the cluster. X says that this has led to a “100x reduction” in the amount of balloons that they need to deploy to deliver consistent Internet connectivity in a given place for prolonged periods of time. Of course, this translates to a more efficient and more economical system that would help keep costs down when, and if, Project Loon does become an official service.

New Yorkers in the “Avenue of Trees,” Central Park, New York. Image: Chris Ford, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 By Gregory Scruggs, Citiscope Friday 17 February 2017 Share this story When New York City decided to offer public Wi-Fi kiosks on city streets, it turned to Sidewalk Labs, whose parent company, Alphabet, also owns tech behemoth Google. The resulting digital infrastructure, called LinkNYC, was designed to bridge the gap between Internet haves and have-nots. The venture cost city taxpayers nothing. Under the terms of the deal, Sidewalk Labs will absorb the cost with revenue from digital advertising and data collection from users. This kind of partnership will be key to implementing the United Nations’ suite of new agreements to improve life in cities around the world, according to a new report from the World Economic Forum. “Harness Public-Private Cooperation to Deliver the New Urban Agenda” argues that to deliver on the outcome of last year’s Habitat III conference on the future of cities, the world must look not to national governments but to private enterprise. “Urbanisation dynamics have evolved over time and call for a transition from the business-as-usual approach of [the public sector] being the sole bearer of transformation to a more collaborative approach enabling the private sector, civil society and academia,” the report states. The World Economic Forum’s Shaping the Future of Urban Development and Services Initiative prepared the report. Its findings are based in part on previous research arguing that the private sector is better equipped to deliver on the full spectrum of the urban value chain, from planning to design to financing to implementation to monitoring. Already, the private sector invests USD 120 billion annually in urban infrastructure, but estimates suggest that USD 78 trillion is needed over the coming decade. Consequently, the report calls for an “enabling environment” that will allow broader private-sector participation in urban infrastructure delivery. Such a plea differs from the debate leading up to Habitat III, when cities demanded an enabling environment that would allow them to access international finance. Instead, the new report calls for governments to set up business-friendly systems with clear guidelines for how the private sector can engage with the public sector in a transparent manner that fosters trust and mutual cooperation. The World Economic Forum cites South Africa’s 1999 Public Finance Management Act and subsequent Public-Private Partnership Manual as a model for what such an environment could look like. Brazil, meanwhile, offers the opposite approach, with engineering and construction firms caught up in a massive public-sector bribery scandal. Now, the Brazilian judicial system must force the company that won a public bid to renovate Maracanã Stadium for the 2014 Olympics to maintain the facility. No quick fix Other than legislation, the report also argues for the importance of strong public institutions that engender trust with private-sector partners and endure over time, even when political administrations change, in order to provide continuity during complex, multi-year projects. The forum’s researchers are open-minded, however, about how projects can be financed. They address new types of finance such as “social impact” bonds, pooled funds and crowdfunding. In 2015, for instance, Rotterdam unveiled a bridge financed by individual contributions, reportedly the world’s first crowdsourced public infrastructure. The report comes at a time when cities and countries are still grappling with the New Urban Agenda, the 24-page voluntary agreement adopted at Habitat III. (See the agenda’s full text here.) The private sector was not strongly represented during Habitat III, with many major infrastructure providers absent. But the World Economic Forum hopes to jump-start private-sector participation as attention shifts to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda. Alice Charles, who leads the WEF’s urban initiative, argues that the new report provides “a taxonomy of recommendations, with reference cases from around the world, to build effective public-private cooperation and help the public sector understand the convergence of the outcomes of the multiple global frameworks”. Those frameworks include the New Urban Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement on climate change and more. The litany of examples offers plenty food for thought but not necessarily any quick fixes. “The recommended actions in this report appear simple to adopt but are challenging to implement,” the report concludes. “Cities, the private sector and civil society must work together and proactively play their part to make it happen.” Providing free Wi-Fi in public spaces offers an illustrative example. Such an effort would hit targets in many of the global frameworks, but New York City’s experiment was not without problems. During the beta phase, for instance, with 400 of an eventual 7,500 kiosks rolled out, homeless users reportedly hogged the new infrastructure for hours at a time, and some were caught watching illicit content on busy city streets. As a result, the Internet browsing feature was turned off. The kiosks still offer Internet-enabled services such as local maps and hotspots for users to browse the Internet on their own devices. Most importantly, Sidewalk Labs and the New York City government did not engage in a public dispute over who was at fault for what many see as an obvious design flaw. Instead, they worked out the kinks together. Last month, LinkNYC celebrated the participation of over a million users.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 17 February 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Convenience vs privacy: the dark side of log-in services What price convenience: Log-in services like Facebook Connect are supposed to make the ordeal of various passwords a lot easier for you. But users pay a price for the service. — dpa Online retailers, streaming services, booking platforms: a user account is needed for many websites.  This means that you'll have to repeatedly enter personal data such as your name and e-mail address and come up with a username and a password – in addition to remembering them for future use.  Log-in services like Facebook Connect are supposed to make this ordeal a lot easier for you. They offer a simple alternative to the bothersome creation of new accounts. The idea is fairly straightforward: Users will have already set up their data, thereby making it unnecessary to create a new identity for a website.  The technical term for this is single sign-on. And that's how it works: With the access data of a user account such as Facebook, you'll be able to use various other services. If an online service has integrated the Facebook log-in interface, simply click on the log-in button to sign in from there. Twitter and Google also offer their own single sign-on solutions.  This offers some advantages to the user: "You can use log-in data you're familiar with and avoid tedious individual sign-ins," says Christian Gollner, data protection expert at the Consumer Centre of the German state Rhineland-Palatinate. However, the users pay the price with their data.  "Facebook and Google are doing business with data analysis." That's how companies will know at the very least which other services you are using, which makes it easier to customise advertising.  Another thing to keep in mind: In some cases, even more data may be transmitted by the website to the log-in service. If you have the time, and are eager to find out what exactly, you can refer to the respective privacy policy.  However, the information you'll find there may sometimes be quite vague. Here's an example from Spotify: The music streaming service simply says that they'll share "some information."  Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is critical of log-in services, not only because of the data shared. Users become dependent, explains a BSI spokesman.  If you no longer want to use a service like Facebook and intend to delete your user account, for instance, you'll also lose access to online services tied to your account via Facebook Connect. This may cause users to think twice about whether to shut down their account with the log-in service.  Experts also strongly advise against using the same login details for various or even all services.  If hackers crack the access to the login service, this could cause enormous damage. They then gain access to all services on which you have signed in using the log-in – in order to do this, they simply have to try out the hacked log-in details on various popular sites.  Once the login details fall into the wrong hands, then security is endangered for all the services used along with them, says Thorsten Strufe. He is professor for privacy and IT security at Dresden Technical University. He says that, for this reason, single sign-on services are not a good solution.  Anyone who still wants to use them should at least be sure to use a secure password for access to the log-in service. According to experts, good passwords have at least 12 characters and comprise numbers, upper and lowercase letters and special characters. They should also not appear in dictionaries – not even partially.  Users can also determine which personal details they offer for the convenient log-in.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 17 February 2017 | MYT 12:40 PM Alphabet’s ‘Loon’ Internet plan closer to deployment Pros and cons: The peek inside X lab and word of speedy progress came the same day that the venture to beam the Internet to the ground via balloon hit a legal snag in Sri Lanka that could see the project abandoned on the island. — Reuters MOUNTAIN VIEW, United States: Google parent Alphabet said that artificial intelligence-infused navigation software has significantly sped up plans to deploy Project Loon Internet balloons to serve remote regions of the world.  Word that being able to more smartly guide high-altitude balloons promised to improve coverage while curbing cost came as Loon hit headwinds in some locales where it has been testing the technology.  ”Our timelines are starting to move up on how we can do more for the world sooner,” said Astro Teller, who heads the team at the Alphabet unit X, in charge of “moonshot” projects of the technology giant.  ”We are looking to move quickly, but to move thoughtfully,” Teller told a small group of reporters inside a former Silicon Valley shopping centre transformed into a “moonshot factory.”  The acceleration was credited to software leaps that allow internet-serving balloons to ride high-altitude winds to ideal locations or loop in patterns that create consistent webs of internet coverage in the sky.  ”We’ve been working to make the balloons smarter; almost like a game of chess with the winds,” Teller said.  He expected Loon to be partnering in coming months with telecom companies to provide Internet to “real users,” in a step up from tests done to see how well the high-floating technology works with networks on the ground.  Teller declined to specify where Loon might first be integrated into telecommunications networks providing service to customers.  ”We are not going to all of a sudden be everywhere,” Teller said.  ”We intend to be part of an ecosystem – in any country where we are doing testing we would work with a local telco.”  Part of the money-making vision for Loon would be to get revenue from telecom operators for extending their reach.  Teller said Loon is one of the more mature projects at X and that it “would be a natural state to graduate into its own company” but there were not plans at the moment for that to happen.   Grounded in Sri Lanka?  The peek inside X lab and word of speedy progress came the same day that the venture to beam the Internet to the ground via balloon hit a legal snag in Sri Lanka that could see the project abandoned on the island.  Project Loon uses roaming balloons to beam Internet coverage and planned to connect Sri Lanka’s 21 million people to the Web, even those in remote connectivity black spots.  But just a year after testing began in Sri Lanka regulators have been unable to allocate Google a radio frequency for the airborne venture without breaching international regulations.   ”There are lots of places excited to run experiments with us,” Teller said.  ”We encourage that, but there are lots of agencies and we need to dot ‘I’s and cross ‘t’s.”  He added that Loon planned to “do things by the book” in any country where it is active, using balloons to get Internet signals far and wide, while local telecom companies tap into the network from the ground.  The first public launch of Loon took place in New Zealand in 2013, when the project was in an early experimental phase.  Alphabet recently told AFP that it gave up on its Internet drone project, called Titan, about a year ago, to focus its resources on Loon where it saw more promise of success.  The economics and technical feasibility of balloons are seen as a more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world to the Internet, according to X.  Leading online social network Facebook is continuing to develop an Aquila drone for beaming Internet connection from the sky. — AFP Related Stories You May Be Interested Verizon close to Yahoo deal, price cut of US$250mil-US$350mil: sources Google adds voice-activated shopping, taking on Amazon Hackers shift tactics after 2016 US election: CrowdStrike Apple to start India manufacturing in coming months with iPhone SE: source Cyber warriors see politics muddying security efforts SMBC head says will give Toshiba as much support as possible Others Also Read With Samsung chief in jail, one-time mentor seen taking charge Mourinho fumes over attitude issues in St Etienne win Genting Highlands to house country‘s second Premium Outlet advertisement Latest News Apple to start India manufacturing in coming months with iPhone SE: source JPMorgan moving mortgages online to please paper-weary customers Pokémon Go: Tips for the Gen 2 update European parliament calls for robot law, rejects robot tax Facebook says Irish challenge to US data transfers ‘deeply flawed’ Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: Tips for the Gen 2 update The smartwatch is dead;

In 2016 Lisbon fired-up its startup engines — 2017 will hear them roar Posted Feb 14, 2017 by Mike Butcher (@mikebutcher) 0 SHARES Next Story Linode challenges DigitalOcean with its new $5 instances In the first of a new series focusing on city eco-systems, TechCrunch Editor-at-large Mike Butcher gets under the skin of one of Europe’s hottest startup cities. During the last financial crisis Portugal was one of the hardest hit countries in Europe. After a long post-war dictatorship until the 1970s, and a slow economic emergence during the 80s and 1990s, the 2008 global recession was a body blow to the country, alongside Italy, Greece and Spain. But then something unusual happened. Like a welter-weight boxer, it started to use its small size in its favour, punching above its weight in a counter-attack led largely by its young people. They realised that they would have to use entrepreneurship as an engine to create their own future, if they were to survive. Inside cafes and the Fado bars, laden with ancient Portuguese tiles, they looked to the Web. And made their plans. Being thrown into the fire of an economic recession made for a much more dynamic culture that many observers had typically come to expect from a southern European country. When the country had to turn to the European Union for a bailout in 2011, Portugal was forced to implement harsh austerity measures. Some 485,000 Portuguese, particularly young university graduates, left the country during the crisis to try to find opportunities abroad. They went to Germany, Brazil and even to the former African colony of Angola. Around 60 percent returned. Today the unemployment rate has fallen from 17 percent in 2012 to 12 percent. Meanwhile, the government raised taxes significantly, liberalized the labor market, laid off civil servants, reduced salaries for public workers as well as pensions and social services. But the crisis also unleashed a new creative energy from within the Portuguese psyche. For instance, a new center for artists was opened at the foot of the fortress looks over the city. And the EU’s Committee of Regions bestowed the city with its “European Entrepreneurial Region of the Year” honor for 2015. There are reasons behind the success story. People are well-educated in Lisbon, and salaries are lower than in other European metropolitan areas, as are living costs. A luxury hostel whose name says everything about this new spirit: The Independente. It looks out over the throng of colorful buildings on Castilo Hill. And startups are based in old buildings with beautiful tiled walls in the cobblestoned streets of downtown Lisboa. And Portugal’s long history of maritime exploration and discovery didn’t hurt. Striking outing new territory is in the Portuguese DNA. And they had something else that was a crucial ingredient. Something that their Southern European cousins didn’t have: a in-built facility with the English language. It was not only taught in schools, but unlike neighbouring Spain, which has a large population and can therefore bear the economic cost of having English films and TV shows translated, little Portugal could not. This familiarity with English is a huge strength for two reasons. Firstly, this made Portugal able to trade internationally more easily. And secondly: the average taxi or Uber driver as well as the average government worker speaks English, something you won’t find in Barcelona or Madrid. Suddenly, it’s far easier to access as an ex-patriot entrepreneur, come to create a business in the sunny climes of the Portuguese sun. This combination put Lisbon in exactly the same environment as Berlin found itself in the mid-2000s, when ex-pats and artists started to flood the city with creative industries, and, crucially startups. [Ad break:grab 2-for-1 tickets on 2-for-1 release is April 5, noon CEST, to Techcrunch Disrupt Berlin] Lisbon boasts an iconic suspension bridge which looks like the Golden Gate Bridge, bronzed surfers, trams, hills and a vibrant technology industry. Remind you of somewhere? Today in 2017 Lisbon scores well on access to talent, affordable housing, and adequate public transportation (not to mention weather). And let’s not forget that the Bairro Alto is a historic picturesque quarter dating from the 16th century, who’s streets are lined with small restaurants, Fado-playing bars, pubs and cafés, which are quiet during the day, but transformed at night into the city’s vibrant nightlife quarter. Beautiful old venues stand side by side with striking contemporary additions. But the city is re-animating these venues, such as the 16th-century Palácio de Pombal which now annually houses the Lisbon Investment Summit. No surprise then that the European Digital City Index lists the top key features in Lisbon as the low-cost of living and the high quality of life. Another factor has played into the city’s hands: Because of the country’s small population, Portuguese startups launch with an eye on international expansion from day one, continuing the tradition of this small, seafaring country. In that respect it’s far closer to the United Kingdon in mindset. It’s these combination of factors that is leading to an explosion of startups in Portual and Lisbon in particular. You could say this is becoming the ‘Berlin of the South’. In 2016 VCs invested only $18.5 million in nine deals, according to Preqin, a global investment research company. Although these numbers are small by comparison internationally, this represented a sixfold jump from 2015. And a 2016 study backed by Allianz Kulturstiftung, the German insurance company’s foundation, ranked Lisbon as the fifth-best-performing startup community in Europe, ahead of such stalwarts as Stockholm and Dublin. Lisbon also scores well in terms of its  “global creative class”, as coined by influential academic Richard Florida. Creative industries are a massive driver of economic growth today, and led to the rejuvenation of London’s East End. But London’s huge price hikes in recent years (and let’s not even go into Brexit) has left it with a growing problem.  The latest statistics show more young people are moving out of London than at any time since records began, because of the cost of housing, which has seen rents rise much faster than salaries. Some 40 per cent of London’s music venues have closed in recent years. In the US, New York creatives and San Francisco tech entrepreneurs are moving in droves to Los Angeles, where it’s cheaper to live well, and in a city with a great art and music scene. And while Berlin continues to pull in these creative classes from more expensive parts of Europe, many are now looking to Lisbon as an alternative.  This year, for example, Europe’s largest technology conference, the Web Summit, will hit the city for the second time, having attracted over 53,000 people to it in 2016, and proved the city can hold those numbers and survive. Some traffic congestion, a strained Metro and a handful of logistical issues at the venue won’t be enough to stop Web Summit from remaining in Lisbon until 2020. And the deal could be extended by a further two years. More than 53,000 people from 166 countries, among them 15,000 companies, 7,000 CEOs and 700 investors, flocked to Lisbon for the event, which was said to generate more than €175 million in revenue for the city, dwarfing the €35m Web Summit was rumoured to have brought to Dublin, where it started. Having pulled off such a huge event, literally showcasing the city, it’s fair to say even more will come in 2017. NEW DEVELOPMENTS Second Home, perhaps the ultimate statement in creative class spaces, was announced for the city last year, but really gets going this year, opening up in the hippest quarter of the city. It will be housed inside the Mercado da Ribeira, joining a number of co-working and artistic spaces in the city including Coworklisboa and Village Underground Lisboa. The latter – linked to Shoreditch’s iconic Village Underground — will be made out of shipping containers and disused buses. Furthermore, Factory, which created a number of iconic startup spaces in Berlin, has also put down rots into the city. At the same time international startup accelerator Startupbootcamp is rumoured to be arriving, as well as ImpactHUB. In fact, a strength – not a weakness – of the Lisbon startup scene is that it’s not just about Portugal or Lisbon. Indeed, it’s no accident that a London-based Second Home might want to expand there. MAIN HUBS The six-story Startup Lisboa building started as the city’s main startup hub, which from 2011 has acted as the city’s founding startup incubator. Around 60 companies are based out of the six-story building where regular events and workshops are also held. Startup Lisboa is an NGO with support from the public sector (Lisbon Municipality) and the private sector as well. The organization has supported more than 180 startups since it started. Fábrica de Startups, a four-year-old accelerator, is headed up by António Lucena de Faria, and concentrates on startups from Portuguese-speaking lands such as Brazil, Macao, and others. In March it will run “Tourism Ideation Week” to create startups for its five-week Discoveries accelerator program this summer. This will be the first Portuguese outpost of Impact Hub, whose global network of socially-minded co-working spaces spans some 70 cities. It’s arriving in an abandoned pavilion in the Beato Marvila district, with desk rentals on offer for up to 300 entrepreneurs for a paltry €80 euros a month. And Beta-i, which runs Lisbon Challenge, has taken over a huge former post office building in the heart of the city. Spread over several floors, this is likely to become a super-hub for startups in the region. It’s also just announced that its merging with Tetuan Valley, a Spanish accelerator, creating an Iberian accelerator and using European Innovation Academy (Berkeley + Stanford) methodologies in Lisbon.  NEW INTERNATIONAL TIES The ties between Lisbon, London and other European cities are actively being cultivated by some of the city’s movers and shakers. For instance, you will often see Alexandre Barbosa, co-founder of Faber Ventures grabbing coffee with fellow VCs in London. Or Beta-i’s Pedro Rocha Vieira or Ricardo Marvão taking its latest crop of startups on a roadshow to London’s Google Campus, precisely because Lisbon is forging close ties with London startup megacity. Or Filipa Neto, CEO of Chic By Choice, attending London Fashion Week. At the same time you might well bump into Felix Petersen, also of Faber, in Berlin, where he is doing a roaring trade attracting talent down from Berlin to Portugal’s capital. Or perhaps you could run into Stephan Morais of Caixa Capital, shepherding a number of young Portuguese startups around Davos (one of the only countries to do so). You may also grab coffee with tech PR and startup adviser Clara Armand-Delille, in a coffee shop over-looking Lisbon’s waterside key, or perhaps in a Parisian cafe. These things are not happening by accident and these ties with the European ecosystem are getting stronger by the hour. OFFICIAL ENCOURAGEMENT And the national and city governments are actively encouraging this wave of internationalism, which is in part leading to the Portuguese ‘diaspora’ from the recession returning, as well as ex-pats starting to populate parts of Lisbon. The government has been almost relentless in making it more appealing to returnees, with tax breaks, residency programs and easier bureaucracy. The Municipality of Lisbon has been bending over backwards to incentivize entrepreneurs to start their companies in the city. These incentives include a reduced tax rate for startup businesses, which can be as low as 7.5 percent, while investments of up to €5m can enjoy tax deductions of 20 percent. Corporate filing red tape, too, has been simplified to a simple online process. A few years ago when the Mayor of Lisbon was asked by a local accelerator about easing access to office space he simply handed over 30 year leases for disused municipal buildings. A key startup advocate is the affable João Vasconcelos, the former head of Startup Lisboa, who has long championed the scene and is now in a key position of power as the new secretary of industry within the Portuguese government. The Portuguese startup community has also not sat on its hands, producing regular blogs and media out of the tech startup scene, and even creating its own Startup Manifesto. The government responded with “Startup Portugal”, a national public strategy to foster entrepreneurship and promote local startups internationally. LEGISLATION It was at Web Summit that Portugal’s Prime Minister António Costa launched a €200 million ($220 million) fund to co-invest alongside VCs in local startups and foreign companies that relocate to Portugal, doing it with 150 local founders standing behind him. The message was very plain: come to Lisbon and found your company there. Any venture fund around the world is eligible to request matching funds for a single investment as long as the startup is located in Portugal. The funds will be called “200M” (it’s 200 million euros) and is part of a bigger push to put $440 million overall into the country’s tech scene over the next two years. Bringing Web Summit over from Dublin was part of that effort is well. Lisbon was the first European Capital of Entrepreneurship in 2015, which led to a whole slew of initiatives such as the “Empresa na hora”, which allows anyone to create a new business inside an hour online. BREXIT BENEFITS With Brexit looming over the horizon, after the UK government formally voted to trigger Article 50 to leave the European Union, the question is, will companies start to form in EU nations like Portugal more readily? And will Lisbon join the ranks of Dublin, Amsterdam and other EU cities as a startup hub? The simple answer is yes, given that the UK will lose part – if not all – its attractiveness as a springboard for expansion in Europe. According to VC firm Balderton, over 40 percent of the founders of British startups earned university degrees outside the country, which makes them far more likely to move around anyway (something apparently lost on the government). TALENT The quality of engineers is great in Portugal and the competition for talent is still limited (with 31% unemployment for under 25s, working for a startup sounds like a great option). A government program called Inov Contacto sends a few hundred Portuguese graduates each year across the world to work inside companies abroad, thus broadening their international ambition and operational experience. Portugal also has a draw for the intellectual diaspora that was previously educated abroad, and now hankers after the old country. After their stint at Stanford, or Goldman Sacs, there is a cultural bond that leads people to want to come back to Lisbon. The fact that developer costs are much lower in Portgal has not gone unnoticed. Portuguese entrepreneur Carlos Silva and US-born partner Jeff Lynn launched their crowd equity platform Seedrs in London, but decided to base their engineering talent in Portugal. That means the country is joining the ranks of Barcelona, Munich, Vienna and others as engineering hubs. But whereas these have plenty of talent, what they don’t have is common use of the English language in every-day life. That makes doing business easier and also attractive for moving into the city from abroad. ROLE MODELS Portugal now has a budding set of hometown heroes. From Jose Neves of Farfetch, to Henrique de Castro of Google/Yahoo fame to Carlos Silva of Seedrs. Early stage funding generally comes from Beta-i to Faber to Portugal Ventures as the most visible and active local funds with Caixa being an active player in direct investments at later stages. More importantly non-Portuguese funds are leading significant rounds in Portuguese based companies. Lisbon/London based Seedrs recently has raised £7.5M from Augmentum Capital and Woodford Patient Capital in London. Unbabel went from Lisbon to Y Combinator and walked out with checks from Google Ventures and Codacy won the 2014 Web Summit competition. And Rocket Internet has quietly built its own operations center with several hundred employees in Porto. INVESTORS The investors based in Lisbon include: Beta-i; Faber Ventures; InterCapital; Busy Angels; Portugal Ventures; and Caixa Capital. Faber Ventures was founded by Alexandre Barbosa. According to him its part startup studio, part investment platform. They’re managing €11m as a first pre-series A fund, and do typically 200-300k Euroos as first ticket (100k if pre-seed) and have always followed on in series A as co-investors.  They have 19 companies in the portfolio and are now raising for a second vehicle, while still doing investments.  Lisbon Challenge, operated by Beta-i, has been acknowledged as one of the top five most active investor programmes in Europe. A number of startups have emerged from it to join the likes of TechStars, Y Combinator and Seedcamp. And 40% of those coming out of Lisbon Challenge have secured VC investment, increasingly from the US. The Lisbon Challenge conference is hosted on the banks of the Tagus river in a former warehouse. Meanwhile foreign investors visit the capital frequently to see what’s going on, with Web Summit now being a perfect annual opportunity to check in on the city. There are no less than seven Seedcamp companies from Portugal: Simpletax, Codacy, Hole19, Crowdprocess, Cashtag, Zercatto and Popcorn Metrics. Government Investment agency Portugal Ventures has a €450 million fund focusing on investments in innovative tech companies as well as startups in more traditional sectors. So far it has 105 Investments in 96 Companies. Then there is the BGI (partnership MIT-ISCTE), an international accelerator directed at tech entrepreneurs, startups & spin-outs. THE STARTUPS Finally, there are the startups. Portugal did not start from scratch. Long before Lisbon became the trending tech hub, there already were many tech related companies in Porto and Coimbra, for example. But Lisbon brought to the scene the inspiration from tech hubs such as the ones in London and Berlin. But now the city is producing solid startups almost from scratch. After turning down a job at Google, Jaime Jorge co-founded Codacy with Joao Caxaria, to make algorithms which could automatically correct mistakes in software code for scores of businesses worldwide. They now work with global giants such ash PayPal and Adobe. Portugal’s best and brightest used to work for consulting firms in major capitals like London, but now they raise money locally and launch globally. SCALE-UPS It’s not as if Lisbon can’t produce big companies. Teleperformance is a global leader in outsourced call centers handling sales, support and all other functions of customer relations, and now employs 150,000 employees and has €2.4 billion in revenues. Meanwhile Porto is becoming a reference in the Portuguese ecosystem. Veniam, AddVolt, Hype labs (with Hype Labs going to AngelPad in the US) and knok healthcare – the uber for doctors – securing funding. Other startups have also seen the benefits of the city. Hole19 is an international social network for golfers. Uniplaces allows students to book housing across Europe. Feedzai uses machine learning to automatically spot fraud for clients globally. CrowdProcess has an AI platform that enables hedge funds and banks to predict when fixed income assets will default. (A great way to keep up with startups form the city is by checking Made Of Lisboa) KEY STARTUPS Uniplaces This has raised $28.94M in 4 Rounds from 8 Investors.

Gleam iOS / Android app for fashion-conscious ladies (mostly) who want to discover the latest and greatest trends in what to wear and what not to wear. Chic by Choice Lets you rent out high-end designer dresses for a small percentage of the retail price. CEO Filipa Neto could operate anywhere in Europe, but spreads her time between London and Lisbon. She’s raised half a million euros in venture capital to send Haute Couture all across Europe. Farfetch An ecommerce platform connecting fashion-conscious clients with a global network of high-end boutiques and founded by Jose Neves in 2007, Farfetch has raised more than $304.5M in 6 Rounds from 15 Investors. These include Advent, e.ventures, Index and, most recently, Conde Nast and Vitruvian Partners. Farfetched is Portugal’s biggest (recent) startup success so far. Nmusic Known in the Portuguese market as “MEO music” due to a white label deal with the dominant Portugal Telecom. It has a TV app, enabling customers to watch music videos and create video playlists on their TV’s. They are teaming up with Samsung to collaborate in Africa. Crowdprocess Backed by Seedcamp, Kima Ventures and Frontline Ventures this connects the web browsers of a large number of participating users and turns them into virtual supercomputers. Unbabel Unbabel enables multilingual communication across 28 languages with a mix of artificial intelligence and a crowd of 50,000 mobile linguists, integrating with platforms like Salesforce, Zendesk, Mailchimp and Facebook Messenger.

Other Portuguese startups to watch include Zaask, TOPDOX, WIME, EyeSee, Zercatto, Prodsmart, Attentive.us, Liquid and Tradiio, LineHealth. TRANSPORT Lisbon has good transport links – the airport is just 15 minutes by taxi from the centre of town – and fast Wi-Fi speeds add to its appeal. COST OF LIVING Lisbon’s has a genuinely low-cost of living. It’s around 75 percent cheaper than London. Which would probably make it about 50% as cheaper than Berlin. It’s unusual to pay much more than €1 for a coffee or beer, while grocery prices are nearly 25 percent less than other European cities. UNIVERSITIES Lisbon’s universities, such as Instituto Superior Técnico, are now turning out entrepreneurs instead of corporate drones. Lisbon benefits from two major universities and one specialist polytechnic institute, which pump out up to 100,000 graduates a year versed in design, development, and programming. Indeed some startups have offices right by the universities for this very reason. EVENTS Other than Web Summit, majors startup events in Lisbon include the Lisbon Investment Summit, both a conference and finale of the Lisbon Challenge accelerator. Also Productizeda product management event. Developers can also check out the Lisbon Scala Conference. STARTUP HANGOUTS • Liberdade 229 – Fun and friendly coworking place filled daily with an interesting crowd of differing backgrounds. • Entrepreneurs Break – An informal networking event set up with entrepreneurs to provide you with startup tools and insights. • Product Tank  – An informal meetup that brings together the local product community in each of those cities. • Village Underground – A coworking and events space for creative activities in the heart of Lisbon. CULTURE / LIFESTYLE A short, sharp espresso in the capital will cost 60 cents to one euro. A railway line linking Lisbon to Cascais takes you to several broad beaches for sun bathing or surfing, inside 15 minutes.

Is it cloud storage, cloud backup, cloud sync, cloud computing? By Dustin Miller HTF Columnist EVELETH – What is the cloud? The simple answer is it is a bunch of servers on the Internet networked together to provide you your services and storage from the Internet instead of your hard drive. Different servers will have different functions, such as processing your requests or storing your data. Most people use the cloud for something—and many don’t even realize it. If you have your phones being backed up to Google or Apple, you are using cloud storage. They give you some storage space to back up your files from your phone in case disaster happens; you will then, hopefully, be able to restore your phone fairly easily with minimal data loss. There are many different types of clouds out there as well. There is cloud storage, cloud backup, cloud sync and cloud software. Google Drive is a cloud computing service, which allows you to edit documents and spreadsheets all online. This service is entirely online-based and even allows you to save files on your account. You don’t even need a computer to use this—there are apps for most smart phones and tablets. Dropbox is an example of a cloud sync application. You upload files and then the files will be transferred to all other dropbox installations that you have installed or users you are sharing the folder/file with. Of course, depending on the size of the file, this can take a little bit of time. This service is primarily used for sharing your files with other computers or people. Cloud storage places such as Apple iCloud or Amazon Cloud are mostly used to back up your files and documents, and store them online. Many of your off-site storages will use a cloud-based storage as well. This gives you a backup of all of your data in the event something happens to your computer. Is the cloud secure? Should I store personal data on the cloud? This depends. Some cloud services will encrypt your data, but always make sure it is encrypted before you do store any personal information up there. All the main cloud companies have many security measures in place to protect your data, but on the Internet (as with anything) there is always that chance it can end up in the wrong hands. Of course, using a strong password will also help keep your data safe. When deciding if you want to use the cloud, you also need to see who actually owns the material once it is uploaded. You may give up some of your rights to that file on some cloud services—so always be sure to check their terms and conditions. I, personally, like the cloud for storing some of my files that I like to access from multiple locations. I mostly use Google Drive’s storage for many of those files. I also use online backup for some of my critical documents in case of a computer crash. Dustin Miller is a general partner of Cold Snap Technology in Eveleth, MN.

Since the launch of the two devices, however, the Really Blue has been limited to the United States in availability and hard to find. Now, however, the device is available from EE in the U.K. As noted by Android Police, the Really Blue variant is available via the EE website and ships in seven days in the Pixel variant and is available for pre-order in the Pixel XL variety. In both sizes, the Really Blue model is sold in the 32GB capacity. It was originally thought that the Really Blue variant of the Pixel and Pixel XL would be a limited-time offering, but Google has continued to restock the device on the Play Store and is now rolling it out to other countries. The expansion to the U.K. this evening comes following the announcement earlier today that the color variant was expanding to Rogers in Canada. If you’re an EE customer and want to get your hands on the Really Blue Pixel or Really Blue Pixel XL, head to the carrier’s website now for all of the details.

Word that being able to more smartly guide high-altitude balloons promised to improve coverage while curbing cost came as Loon hit headwinds in some locales where it has been testing the technology. "Out timelines are starting to move up on how we can do more for the world sooner,"  said Astro Teller, who heads the team at the Alphabet unit X, in charge of "moonshot" projects of the technology giant. "We are looking to move quickly, but to move thoughtfully," Teller told a small group of reporters inside a former Silicon Valley shopping center transformed into a "moonshot factory." The acceleration was credited to software leaps that allow internet-serving balloons to ride high-altitude winds to ideal locations or loop in patterns that create consistent webs of internet coverage in the sky. "We've been working to make the balloons smarter; almost like a game of chess with the winds," Teller said. He expected Loon to be partnering in coming months with telecom companies to provide internet to "real users," in a step up from tests done to see how well the high-floating technology works with networks on the ground. Teller declined to specify where Loon might first be integrated into telecommunications networks providing service to customers. "We are not going to all of a sudden be everywhere," Teller said. "We intend to be part of an ecosystem -- in any country where we are doing testing we would work with a local telco." Part of the money-making vision for Loon would be to get revenue from telecom operators for extending their reach. Teller said Loon is one of the more mature projects at X and that it "would be a natural state to graduate into its own company" but there were not plans at the moment for that to happen. - Grounded in Sri Lanka? -The peek inside X lab and word of speedy progress came the same day that the venture to beam the internet to the ground via balloon hit a legal snag in Sri Lanka that could see the project abandoned on the island. Project Loon uses roaming balloons to beam internet coverage and planned to connect Sri Lanka's 21 million people to the web, even those in remote connectivity black spots. But just a year after testing began in Sri Lanka regulators have been unable to allocate Google a radio frequency for the airborne venture without breaching international regulations.  "There are lots of places excited to run experiments with us," Teller said. "We encourage that, but there are lots of agencies and we need to dot 'I's and cross 't's." He added that Loon planned to "do things by the book" in any country where it is active, using balloons to get internet signals far and wide, while local telecom companies tap into the network from the ground. The first public launch of Loon took place in New Zealand in 2013, when the project was in an early experimental phase. Alphabet recently told AFP that it gave up on its internet drone project, called Titan, about a year ago, to focus its resources on Loon where it saw more promise of success. The economics and technical feasibility of balloons are seen as a more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world to the internet, according to X. Leading online social network Facebook is continuing to develop an Aquila drone for beaming internet connection from the sky.

Feb 17, 2017, 2:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  ai artificial intelligence Music piano Robots video Share Most people don't like to be alone for too long. We need — nay, crave — the attention of others. When that attention comes from an intelligent piano-playing machine, however, things get weird. AI Duet, a new experiment from Google, does just this. It's pretty simple: Open up the web player, play a few notes on your keyboard, and wait for your strange new robot friend to respond with its own music. It's like jamming, if jamming involved a machine instead of your long-haired friend who likes to noodle badly on the guitar. When I first tried it, it didn't work quite as planned. I played a few notes — terribly, because one semester of piano lessons in university taught me how to play the beginning of Coldplay's "Clocks" and nothing else, which is horrific and sad in its own way — but my computer friend didn't answer. It made me question a lot of things for a few minutes, but then it started working and I was saved from my brewing existential crisis. Anyway, it's hard to understate how weird it is to duet with a computer. It appears to observe the rhythm and key, though the guy in Google's promotional video insists he didn't program it to do that. Say it with me now: They're learning.  Gizmodo's managing editor Mario Aguilar also found the piano computer very disconcerting (Image: Alex Dickinson) Sometimes the computer's response, which is represented by a series of orange bars, takes an unexpected turn, and veers off course from what you've plugged in. Other times, however, it responds perfectly, even before you're finished playing, so the two of you can make beautiful music at the same time. I felt a swell of something approximating pride when this happened, but I am not going to investigate that further. At the very least, fiddling with this thing is an excellent distraction. I feel less lonely now, but I also worry that one day this computer will take my job. I hope that it, too, learns how to play "Clocks" one day.

Name: Subject: Message: Deal: President’s Day sale on Google Play Movies Newsby Brian Reigh5 hours ago February 16th, 2017 5 175 7 It’s George Washington’s birthday soon, and Google is celebrating by offering movies that are under 10 dollars on the Play Store. Whether you’re planning a romantic night with your bae or looking for some intense horror, it might be worth your time to check it out. Next Monday is President’s Day, and no, we are most definitely not celebrating Donald Trump. It’s to celebrate America’s very first president who was born on February 22nd, and what better way to celebrate his birth than with discounted movies? Well, that’s what Google seems to think anyway, and it has 36 select movies for less than 10 dollars this weekend. Are you looking for something to watch with your kids? There is the 2016 iteration of the never-ending franchise that is Ice Age or the cheeky but adorable penguins from, well, Penguins of Madagascar. If animation isn’t your kids’ cup of tea, there are movies like Pan and Now You See Me 2. Into something a bit more romantic? Movies like The Fault in Our Stars – which used to be $15 – are now $8.99. And trust me, you’ll need a box of Kleenex for that. And on the opposite side of the spectrum, if you’re planning a bro night, Sausage Party (get it?) is now only $9.99. Unfortunately, however, if you were looking for an award-winning, life-changing movie, you’re probably out of luck here. While all the movies here are under 10 dollars, most of them aren’t critically acclaimed films per se.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Alexa now lets you make Outlook your default calendar app By Ida Torres - February 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you prefer using Outlook as your calendar app, whether for work or for personal reasons, then you may have been a bit peeved that Alexa, Amazon’s digital voice assistant for its various devices like Echo, Tap, and Echo Dot, wouldn’t let you add it as the default calendar app. But now, they are rectifying that as you now have the option to use either Google Calendar or Outlook to check on your schedules, add appointments, and other things you could do through Alexa. Previously, Google Calendar was the only third-party calendar that you could add to your Alexa-powered devices. So this new update is good news for those who prefer Outlook or who are “forced” to use it for their work. You don’t need to download or add a specific Alexa skill to make this possible. You can configure it from your Alexa app directly. From within the app, just open the left navigation menu, go to the settings and choose Calendar. Then you can link your Outlook account and just log in to it with your username and password. After that, you can now ask Alexa things like what’s on your calendar or even ask for a specific date’s schedule. Of course, you can also ask it to add a new event or appointment on your calendar. But you will only be able to use it for now for your Amazon Echo, Tap, or Echo Dot. Some OEMs have reportedly been in talks to make Alexa its default digital assistant, so hopefully, this will also carry over to that. Some do think that Alexa is far superior to Google Assistant. Some OEMs are also reportedly developing their own digital assistants, so it would be interesting to see what the landscape will be like in the next few months.

(Photos: Andy Bridgewater / LinkedIn; AFP/Eric Piermont) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A Pictures of bean bags, go karts and slides in Google's office inspired 7-year-old British girl Chloe Bridgewater to write in to see if the tech giant would give her a job, according to her father.  "Dear Google boss," she wrote. "My name is Chloe and when I am bigger I would like a job with Google. I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics."  Confessing that she did not know what a job application was and that she had only ever sent one other letter to "Father Christmas", Chloe nonetheless made her case for being hired by one of the most sought-after employers globally. "My teachers tell my mum and dad I am very good in class and am good at my spelling and reading and my sums," she wrote. In a post on professional networking site LinkedIn, the little girl's father Andy Bridgewater shared the letter and the unexpected reply from Google's chief executive officer Sundar Pichai himself.  Thanking Chloe for the letter, Pichai said that he hoped she would continue to learn about technology.  "I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to - from working at Google to swimming in the Olympics," he wrote.  "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school!" India-born Pichai, 44, joined Google as its vice president of product management in 2004 and worked his way up to become its CEO in 2015.  (Photo: Andy Bridgewater/LinkedIn) MOTIVATED AGAIN AFTER CAR ACCIDENT Chloe's father explained that she had lost "a great deal of confidence" after being knocked down by a car a couple of years ago.  "However, to say she is delighted after receiving this letter signed by Sundar Pichai himself is an understatement," he said.  "Can't thank such a busy person enough to take time out to make a little girl's dream become one step closer." After reading the letter, the girl is "now even more eager to do well at school and work for Google", Bridgewater added.  - CNA/mz Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

The apex court was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), which was filed in 2008 by Sabu Mathew George, seeking a ban on foreign websites which are soliciting couples to undergo sex determination tests. SC ordered the three companies to set up an in-house mechanism to identify and block keywords indicative of sex determination in contravention to Section 22 of the Pre-Conception & Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PPDT) Act, 1994, under which sex determination tests are banned in this country. It also expressed its deep concern for the dwindling sex ratio in India. The bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra commented how manipulation of sex ratio could result in a “disaster for mankind”. This order was passed despite vehement objections by Google’s lawyer Ruby Ahuja and Senior Advocate KV Viswanathan. The arguments put forth by them included difficulties in setting up an in-house mechanism to monitor the entire internet. The order, they said, could also lead to a slew of complaints against them that had potential to convert into litigations. The court also pulled up the tech companies for failing to implement auto block mechanisms. Ahuja argued that this was not possible since completely blocking certain search words would also restrict one’s access to scholarly articles on the topic. The Supreme Court had earlier directed the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to set up a nodal agency to enforce the ban on commercial advertisements and all forms of information on internet relating to pre-natal sex determination tests to find out whether a fetus is a boy or girl. Additional Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar representing the Centre submitted that as per previous court orders, the Nodal Agency has been set up, and is ready to assist in this matter. The matter will be next heard on April 11. Back story Prenatal sex determination was outlawed by the Parliament in 1994 to prevent sex-selective abortions. However, strict implementation of the law continues to be a problem. In 2015, SC had also expressed its dissatisfaction with the number of people booked for violating this law in certain states. Online, if you search “gender determination test” in a search engine, various links selling you kits online will pop up. Among those, there are a few DIY (do it yourself) tests to try at home. While these may be old wives’ tales, yet they are popular. Despite sex determination during pregnancy being against the law, most sites do not reflect this information, except eBay (which categorically states that such kits are not available for sale in India). Google.in also carries an advisory on such links, which cites: “Warning, Be advised — Pre-conception and pre-natal gender screening or testing is illegal in India.” Why sex determination is banned in india Prenatal sex determination was banned in India in 1994, under the Pre-conception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act.The aim of the Act is to prevent sex-selective abortion, which is prevalent even to this day, due to the preference of a male child in most families. This is also the main reason behind the skewed child sex ratio in the country. dna Correspondent TOP TOP < Samsung chief Jay Lee arrested in corruption investigation   Comments   Also Read Health Over 200 baldness-linked genetic markers uncovered Health Heart Month 2017: How to make your diet heart-healthy Sport Why 'heading' may put footballers at risk of dementia Health One in four Indians suffers from non-communicable diseases Health India joins UN network to halve maternal, newborn deaths Health One kind step for a couple, one big leap for tackling ‘C’ word < Previous ArticleNext Article > Samsung chief Jay Lee arrested in corruption investigation Live Cricket Score Live NZ 102/8 (14) NZ need 84 runs in 36 balls at 14 rpo SA 185/6 (20) Full Scorecard | Commentary Live AUS 15/0 (2.3) SL (Yet to bat) Full Scorecard | Commentary New Zealand vs South Africa Fri, 17 February 2017, 11:30 AM IST Related Include all tobacco products in demerit goods category: Experts India ill-prepared for NCD epidemic: The Economist Over 200 baldness-linked genetic markers uncovered Video WATCH: What do Mumbai's Tamils have to say about the dramatic political twists in their home state?

I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics,” she wrote. "My dad said I can sit on bean bags and go down slides and ride go-karts in a job in Google," she continued before adding her love for tablets and robots. "My dad told me to give you an application to get a job in Google. I don't really know what one of them is but he said a letter will do for now." Bridgewater also said she has done well in school and gets good grades. “My dad gave me a game where I have to move a robot up and down squares, he said it will be good for me to learn about computers,” she wrote. "Thank you for reading my letter. I have only ever sent one other and that was to Father Christmas. Good bye,” she ended the letter. Pichai hasn’t offered Bridgewater a job, but he said he hopes she continues to pursue her dreams. "I'm glad that you like computer and robots," Pichai said in his reply, "[I] hope that you will continue to learn about technology. If you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to -- from working at Google, to swimming in the Olympics." Here’s Pichai's full reply: "Thank you so much for your letter. I'm glad that you like computers and robots, and hope that you will continue to learn about technology. "I think if you keep working hard and following your dreams, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to - from working at Google to swimming at the Olympics. "I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school! :) "All the best to you and your family." Andy Bridgewater along with the rest of the family was very much surprised that the CEO wrote back. He shared the photo on LinkedIn, and it has gone viral.  He told Business Insider that he encouraged his daughter to “get the ball rolling” and sent a letter to the tech company to see if she could get a job. [Chloe] Bridgewater didn’t get a job, but her father said she was still eager to pursue her dreams while working hard in school, especially after receiving the letter. “Can’t thank such a busy person enough to take time out to make a little girl’s dream become one step closer, although not sure she’s fully aware that it’ll take more than riding go karts and sleeping in pods to make it with Google!” he wrote on LinkedIn.

The Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) will blast off from Sriharikota, India at approximately 10:58 p.m. Eastern time. Most of the satellites being launched are small cubesats, less than a foot wide, and 88 were built by imaging company Planet. The "Dove" satellites will be used to continually photograph the Earth at high resolutions, similar to Google Earth. These satellites will join 50 already in orbit, where they will photograph all the major landmasses on Earth daily-approximately 58 million square miles. Planet hopes to sell this imaging technology to all sorts of people, including governments and corporations. The daily imaging data could be used by farmers to estimate crop yields, relief workers to respond to natural disasters, and private companies looking to purchase data aquired through the widespread Earth imaging. View photos Photo credit: PlanetMore Planet just purchased another small satellite company, Terra Bella, from Google this past month, according to Wired. Terra Bella came with seven satellites already in orbit, each with four to six times the imaging resolution of the Dove satellites. When one of Planet's network of Dove satellites identifies a target for imaging-such as changes in water levels or the movement of military forces-the company can point one of the bigger Terra Bella satellites at the target for a higher resolution image. With the launch of 88 new Dove satellites tonight, Planet is quickly becoming the premier company in providing Earth imaging data from space. In addition to the 88 Planet satellites, the PSLV rocket is also launching 15 additional small satellites from many international partners, including two NASA navigational satellites, an Israeli cubesat from Ben Gurion University, an experimental satellite from the EU that will test new methods of power generation in space, and the first ever cubesat from the UAE. The main payload of the rocket is the Indian Cartosat 2D, a cartography satellite designed to accurately map the Earth's geography. Because the Cartosat is the rocket's main payload, it will be deployed into its orbit first, with the remaining satellites deployed after in a timed sequence. If the launch goes smoothly and all the satellites are successfully deployed, India's PSLV rocket will snatch the title for most satellites ever launched at one time.

Google’s work features in Android were developed to address the massive demand for using personal devices in the business environment. The basic idea is to create a separate profile on the device which has business-level controls, while leaving the original, personal profile open and unmanaged. The Android mechanism of user separation relies on an additional sandbox or secure container, where apps outside the sandbox cannot access data inside the sandbox,” explained Yair Amit, CTO and co-founder, Skycure, in a blog. “In other words, no application installed within the device’s personal profile should have any kind of access to the activity or content in the work profile.” However, Skycure found that two ‘app-in-the-middle’ attacks could get around this. The first issue is that work persona notifications are presented alongside personal notifications in the same, seamless interface. Since Notifications access is a device-level permission, a malicious app in the personal profile can acquire permission to view and take actions on all notifications, including work notifications, by design. Sensitive information, such as calendar meetings, email messages and other information appears in these notifications, which are also visible to the “personal” malicious app. If the malicious app is designed to transmit the information viewed in notifications to a command and control server, then the information contained in notifications is no longer secure. Worse, “a clever hacker may be able to use this method to gain even greater access into sensitive work information by initiating a forgot[ten] password process on some enterprise system and hijacking the subsequent on-device notification to grant himself full enterprise access, even outside of the context of the mobile device,” said Amit. “To keep this attack covert, the malicious app can immediately dismiss the notification and ‘archive’ the recovery email using the Android Notifications API so the victim is completely unaware they have been hacked….The attacker may even capture two-factor authentication and administrators will not have any visibility of the theft.” As for the second vulnerability, it exists in the Accessibility Service, which provides user interface enhancements to help users interact with their device. This includes features like audible narration of on-screen text for visually impaired users. In order to facilitate these features, the Accessibility Service necessarily has access to virtually all content and controls, both reading and writing, on the device. An application in the personal profile that acquires Accessibility permissions can gain access to applications that are executed in the business persona, effectively circumventing the secure separation. “This app-in-the-middle resides in the personal profile, yet is effective in stealing corporate information as the user interacts with it,” Amit said. “The personal profile cannot be monitored or controlled from the work profile, so even if IT administrators try to enforce security on the work profile (e.g., by restricting the profile settings or allowing only whitelisted apps) it won’t be possible to detect any exposure of sensitive information that uses the Accessibility Service, as they cannot access the personal profile. In order to perform such an attack, a malicious application would register as an Accessibility Service, present it with an innocent label, and manipulate the user to grant the access.” The Android team says that both of these are “intended behaviors”—which means that no patch will be forthcoming. “As that behavior poses an unexpected and clear threat to corporate data of organizations that utilize Android for Work, we have mutually agreed to disclose the findings with the public, to raise awareness to the exposure,” Amit said.

She shares her concerns about cosmetic surgery games aimed at children as young as three Cosmetic surgery games for children – five words you don’t expect to see together. Yet that’s exactly what came up when my nine-year-old searched online for “free games for kids” one afternoon a couple of months ago. She showed it to me and we had the usual discussion about downloading apps without asking, then I took a closer look. The game is set in a clinic, and players perform cosmetic surgery on animated patients. My patient wanted her nose fixed, which involved marking where the incision should go, using a scalpel to cut into the skin, moving a bone inside the nose, then gluing and stitching up the wound. According to the game blurb, “Every girl dreams of delicate face and stunning figure. If makeup can’t give the beauty you want, then come to join this amazing plastic surgery game!” I deleted the game, and explained to my daughter that I thought it was a little bit gross and a lot inappropriate and that it gives the wrong message to children about appearance. I’m not sure she understood the last part, but she was happy to forgo the game as it was a bit – in her words - “ick”. So is it simply about the “ick” factor or are there greater concerns about children playing cosmetic surgery games? Psychologist Deirdre Cowman, who is campaigning to stop games like this being marketed to children, says it’s not just about the graphic imagery. “It’s also because of the message these games give to young people about changing your body to meet societal expectations of beauty. I want kids to grow up feeling comfortable in their bodies and not to be exposed to games about plumping lips and removing wrinkles - which ultimately teach them that their bodies are things to be fixed rather than enjoyed.” The #SurgeryIsNotAGame campaign is being run by Endangered Bodies, an international movement challenging body-toxic culture. The campaign includes a petition calling on Apple, Amazon and Google to prohibit the marketing of cosmetic surgery applications to children. One of the challenges facing the campaign is that research is scarce. “The games are such a new phenomenon, there isn’t really concrete evidence out there yet,” says Dr Cowman. “However, research has shown that when children and adolescents view idealised images of women and men, they have stronger body dissatisfaction. And interestingly, research conducted by the University of the West of England found that young girls who played with ‘makeover’ apps for only ten minutes showed a decrease in their body confidence. This suggests that exposure to these games could potentially be harmful in terms of how young people see themselves.” Dr Farrah-Hani Imran is a plastic, reconstructive and cosmetic surgeon who is currently undertaking a PhD in the School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin - she encounters people every day who are dissatisfied with their appearance. “When people find out my day job, the questions that immediately follow are, ‘How can I change X’, or ‘I hate my lips, nose, cheeks, chin, eyes, breasts’ and so on. This is usually from a person with no functional deformity, exhibiting clear signs of low self-esteem; enamoured by glossy magazines and media images to conform to perceived ideals.” Dr Imran is concerned that cosmetic surgery games may contribute to this problem. “While it is fun to play virtual dress up and do basic operations - think of the board game Operation - once it goes into actual aesthetic procedures and cosmetic surgery aimed at children, a line has been crossed. The games trivialise and normalise aesthetic procedures and cosmetic surgery.” Left: Dr Deirdre Cowman is calling on Apple, Amazon and Google to stop cosmetic surgery games being marketed to children. Right: Dr Farrah-Hani Imran, concern over games. Dr Cowman is keen to point out that the issue isn’t the games themselves, but rather the fact that they’re being played by children. “We’re not asking for these games to be banned,” she explains. “It’s totally up to the individual to decide if they want to play games like this. However, we are calling on Apple, Amazon and Google to stop the games from being marketed to children. The games generally feature large, bright logos and cartoon characters, which appeal to a young audience. We’re asking these three major platforms to do more than simply including a recommended age range for these games. We’re asking them to implement a policy which is clear to every game developer, that they will not accept any such apps that are targeted at children.” I contacted Google to find out how apps get their ratings and a spokesperson explained it as follows. “Google Play’s policies are designed to provide a great experience for users and developers. While we don’t comment on specific apps, we can confirm that our ratings are based on the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) guidelines. If users come across any apps they think violate these policies, we encourage them to report it to our support team so we can review the app and take action if necessary.” I checked the age rating for the game my daughter downloaded – it’s a “PEGI 3” meaning it’s suitable for children aged three and upwards. So how does a plastic surgery game end up with an age rating of three? Lee Cash, a game producer who has worked in the gaming industry here and abroad, explains how the rating system functions. “The developer completes a self-assessment form declaring the nature of the content contained within their app or game. The content is then reviewed and, if the platform holder agrees with the assessment, it passes and is fit for publication on the store. The crux of the issue, and why inappropriate content can sneak through the morality net, is down to the sheer volume of content that is relentlessly flung at the platform holders. Nudity and violence is universal in its classification of propriety; few would argue where such content falls on the spectrum of suitability. Plastic surgery apps aimed at children, however? It’s fuzzy and, quite simply, the platforms likely have no clear designated position on content of this nature.” Of course, the first line of defence for monitoring online activity is the parent, and in a perfect world, we would all make sure our children never download inappropriate games. However, I suspect mine is not the only household in which apps can slip through the parental net. James Kelleher, developer of The Lonely Beast apps, feels it goes without saying that children shouldn’t be playing these games. “There are hundreds of these shoddy surgery clones littering the app stores - I remember seeing one where you could operate on a badly-drawn bootleg Peppa Pig - and they’re usually vehicles for countless in-app purchases and spammy ads. “These plastic surgery games are a disturbing sub-genre of an already weird game niche, and a good reminder of why parents shouldn’t rely on PEGI ratings or app stores to filter what their kids are playing.” In the meantime, what can parents do to help children to develop positive body image? “It’s hard to completely shelter your children from the world’s obsession with appearance and weight so it’s important to encourage kids to think critically about the media they consume,” says Dr Cowman. “As well as traditional media, this also includes cartoons, music videos, social media and computer games which often subtly - and not so subtly- promote the idea that only very thin or very muscular bodies are acceptable.” She says it’s also a good idea to be aware of how you talk about your own body and other people’s bodies in front of children. “Children pick up on little things and if they grow up hearing their parents criticise their bodies or being overly concerned about calories, it has an impact on how they feel about themselves and their bodies. We hope that the #surgeryisnotagame campaign can also start a conversation about how we can raise body positive children and create a society that accepts and celebrates all bodies.” There are eight Endangered Bodies representatives around the world supporting the petition and Andrea Mara is the Irish representative.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google says major bugs like Stagefright had little to zero ‘real life’ effect on Android users By John Hoff - February 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter A lot of people bash Android for the lack of security and privacy in the platform. Google would be first to admit that it is complicated work securing a platform that was designed to be open source, after all. But for all its scares of bugs and malicious hackers and vulnerabilities, the mothership claims that major bugs – like last year’s Stagefright bug – have claimed little to zero Android users as victims. Adrian Ludwig, director of Android security, spoke at this year’s RSA Security Conference and said that while Stagefright did put 95 per cent of Android devices at risk, there have been no “confirmed” cases of infections via the bug. This is a very strong claim, especially when you think that it was the Stagefright bug that ultimately pushed Google to start updating Android security on a monthly basis. Ludwig says that this was also the case with big bugs before Stagefright – like MasterKey in 2013 and FakeID in 2014. He says that the infection rate went from one for every million users to as “much” as 8 for every million. “Most of the abuse we get isn’t interesting from a security perspective,” he said. “We see spamming ads for fake antivirus stuff but it’s really basic social engineering. Even if malware is installed it seldom involved privilege escalation, it primarily just downloads other apps.” Ludwig is pretty confident in this – that making exploits for Android is pretty much just a major annoyance. But we just hope that malicious hackers out there don’t see this as a direct challenge. That would not be good for the users at all.

Name: Subject: Message: Google’s Project Loon can now use fewer balloons to offer internet access Newsby John Callaham9 hours ago February 17th, 2017 3 249 7 Project Loon is certainly one of the more “out there” projects that being funded by Google’s parent company Alphabet. The idea is to help areas of the world that have little to no internet service to get access via a series of high-altitude balloons that can send and receive data to the ground below. Today, the Project Loon team offered an update on their efforts, and they claim that they have found a way to use less balloons than they first thought to accomplish the same task. See also: Artificial intelligence takes to the skies with Project Loon September 26, 2016 In an post on its Google+ page, the Loon team said that back when the project was first tested in 2013, they thought they would need to put up a “continuous stream of balloons around the world” in order to fulfill the project’s goals. Since then, the team says they have learned a lot more about how the high winds in the upper atmosphere move. As a result, the Loon team has made changes to its navigation algorithm and the balloons’ altitude control system. Now, the team says they can make the Loon balloons access a wider variety of winds in the air, and they can move north, south, east, or west. As a result, those balloons don’t need to be placed in a ring around the world, but rather can be clustered over a more concentrated area that may lack internet access. This also means that less balloons overall will need to be put in the air. This new method has already been tested in the field. In 2016, the Loon team launched balloons from Puerto Rico that were sent over the country of Peru. They were able to keep a cluster of those balloons over Peruvian airspace, and some stayed up for as long as three months. The Loon team believes that, using this new clustering method for its balloons, it is now “years closer to our goal of bringing Internet connectivity to unserved areas.” While that may be true, it’s also true that Alphabet has also been looking harder into its “moon shot” projects like Loon. Tons of money has already been sunk into this project, with no profitable results so far. Loon has only been tested in small scale efforts around the world, but so far, there’s no word on when full scale service will begin.

Friday  February 17th 2017 Home News Features Sports Business Opinion Editorial Obituaries Image Gallery Contact us     NAVIGATE : Home  » Business » Esri is clear on the route to take with its Map Tech Esri is clear on the route to take with its Map Tech February 16, 2017, 9:37 pm Seventy-one-year-old Jack Dangermond, and his wife Laura Dangermond, are often together described as the "king and queen of GIS technology", the software used to create digital maps. In 1969, the duo founded mapping company Esri that has over 40% of the global GIS market share and more than $1billion in annual revenue. In an interview with ETtech, Jack talks about his plans in India. Excerpts: How did major shifts in the technology shape your company? We have spent billions of dollars over the past 15 years on re-developing and refactoring the same algorithms for visualisation and spatial analysis so that they work well in a web-services environment. Today, we make about a billion maps on our platform every day and have about 3 million subscribers on that platform. It's kind of like Salesforce for mapping, except that it is not only mapping but also analytics. There are about 8 million datasets that have been shared by our users. We increasingly see our users share their soil, vegetation and topographic maps on the cloud. And other users are able to use those maps and fuse them together. So, this is the fastest growing segment of our business: It still represents less than 20% of our revenue, but its growing like crazy. How did you compete against Google? We are a B2B company and are focused on enterprise customers. We don't sell advertising, we sell software. It was never Esri Vs Google. Our software and services are used by 350,000 organisations across the world. One of our customers, Reliance, uses our platform for all its utilities, phones and networks. We spent 27% of our revenue on R&D. We spend between $300 million a year on R&D. We just launched a billion-dollar software platform. It will be more mobile and easy to access. What are your plans in India? The big area in India where we work closely with the Forest Ministry is in protection and management of Indian forests. The first map of Indian forests made in part by the Department of Space in India with the remote sensing satellites showed that over a period of years, Indian forests would be declining very rapidly and that told a story all the way to a member of the Gandhi family. She saw what was occurring to the Indian forests and changed policy and said that no, we should stop this destruction of the Indian forests. So, because of GIS, the Forest Law came into the being. A 14-year old kid along with his team from India used our story-mapping tool and mapped the Ganga to find out how the pollution levels in Delhi are related to the Bay of Bengal and the pollution happening in Mumbai. But in India, we have not been so successful. We have made a number of attempts over the years to provide our software to this environment, but it requires leadership and special interest by the teaches. We have not been able to build a relationship with the education ministry but we are open to the idea of getting our software for schools here. How do you look at start-ups in India now? Today there are thousands of start-ups that are dominated by venture capitalists, entailing a kind of artificiality in creating business and not a great formula for success. The cycle of taking a VC is troubling because it robs entrepreneurs of their dignity instead of facing their vision. The idea of monetising that by borrowing money or taking VC route was not something I wanted to do because I didn’t want to sell my soul to stockholders and VC people. GIS is considered one of the key growth areas in ICT. In Sri Lanka over 150 Organizations trust ArcGIS Platform to deliver their critical GIS related organizational needs, most of it concentrated in the public sector. In fact all of Sri Lanka’s authoritative maps are created on the ArcGIS Platform. Key Public sector Organizations in Sri Lanka like the Survey Department of Sri Lanka, Road Development Authority, National Water Supply and Drainage Board and all the National Universities have been using ArcGIS for years. ArcGIS Platform has been in Sri Lanka since the late 1980’s and has been continuing to be the most used, preferred and user-friendly platform for GIS. National Universities conduct Varied GIS courses including Masters Programs which means there is a readymade workforce. GIS has been introduced to the Advance Level Geography curriculum recently, which goes to show the importance of this area as a science to a country. As the country is going through a major digital transformation and automation, ArcGIS will play a key role in this process as GIS is at the heart of any nations digital transformation as it facilitates it. GIS should be part of all key databases with national importance as it can play a crucial role in driving efficient and more informed decision making, Optimizing on resources, providing efficient citizen services and driving economic growth. When adopting GIS technology based system for an organization or an national it is important to consider the sustainability and long-term maintenance of the System its adaptability to the changing ITC environment, bug fixing, changing OS (operations systems) Networks etc., It is important that the GIS system is built on platform that is proven and sustainable and a technical collaboration partnership is built with a reputed long standing proven organization.    Hits: 53     Send to Friend               Breaking News Await Breaking News Last Updated Feb 16 2017 | 08:57 pm ...   Featured News Switzerland loops in Sri Lanka... 2017-02-16 Read More   Modern Man – the Most... 2017-02-16 Read More   Was U.S. for or against the LTTE? 2017-02-16 Read More         ARCHIVES RELATED LINKS Friday, 17th February 2017 [Current Issue] Thursday, 16th February 2017 Wednesday, 15th February 2017 Tuesday, 14th February 2017 Monday, 13th February 2017 Sunday, 12th February 2017 Saturday, 11th February 2017 More Archives World Clock Currency Rates Weather     UPALI NEWSPAPERS (PVT) LTD Copyright © Upali Newspapers (Pvt) Ltd.

AI is largely seen as the full realization of what big data, analytics and automation have been moving towards — a fuller implementation of machine learning. It is being explored in a variety of verticals. Ford announced last week that it is investing $1 billion in startup Argo AI aimed at developing a brain for connected, autonomous vehicles. Consumers are getting comfortable with the concept of AI in their homes. Amazon has said that it sold millions of its Echo devices, which rely on Amazon’s Alexa AI for user interactions. AI research is also flourishing. As CIO Magazine noted, “Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft all open-source or share their latest research in AI to advance developments in the space. These moves from such notable organizations also meet the collective interests of scientists and researchers who prefer to share their findings with the larger community, instead of limiting access to a select group.” On the telco side, work exploring AI’s role in the network has been focused on more intelligent orchestration with an eye toward AI-assisted implementations of 5G. In early 2016, KDDI R&D Laboratories and partners Wind River KK, Hewlett-Packard Japan, and Brocade K.K., developed an AI-assisted automated network operation system for virtualized networks; the proof-of-concept was aimed at exploring automated network operation with AI-based failure prediction. In identifying key big data trends for 2017, Ovum said that it has “seen machine learning proliferate, from consumer services to enterprise applications and tooling; for instance, machine learning has become table stakes for data preparation and other tools related to managing curation of data for data lakes.” Ovum went on to say that “machine learning will be the biggest disruptor for big data analytics in 2017.” Nokia plans to boost its NFV orchestration capabilities through its recently announced purchase of Comptel for 347 million euros ($370.8 million). While Nokia’s initially announced plans for Comptel focused on NFV orchestration and rebalancing its focus on software versus hardware, Comptel launched late last year a suite of AI-powered applications for telcos with customer engagement and “next best actions” in mind. Mikko Jarva, CTO of the intelligent data business unit at Comptel, said that AI applications, such as the new FasterMind suite of applications, is the next logical step for big data. “If we think about big data applications, they have been around and related to data storage and data discovery, reporting and also interesting predictive analytics use cases,” Jarva said. “Going to the next step is when you start making the data actionable and extracting value out of it. You need to come up with a capability that can take the insights and make them work for you.” FasterMind focuses on recommendations, predictions and automation of real-time customer engagement for cross-selling and upselling. Jarva said that since the applications need to work much faster than typical big data applications, they work with a smaller, more focused data set that is part of an overall “data fabric.” Comptel’s approach, he said, is to leverage AI as part of helping people design use cases and offers, identifying the customer journey and the points at which end users are most open to new offers, and improving the customer experience with contextual information and AI-powered chatbots or real-time data for customer service reps — all on a shorter time-scale that is more relevant to both the operator and the consumer. “This is part of a bigger trend we have seen in the move toward real-time,” he added. “I think there is more interest in moving from after-the-fact to deciding in real-time what to do with the data and the insights.”       Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) AI big data COMPTEL Nokia About Author Kelly Hill Twitter LinkedIn Editor, Big Data, Analytics, Test & MeasurementKelly Hill currently reports on network test and measurement, as well as the use of big data and analytics.

Updated 13 hours ago In the California desert, a pair of Western Pennsylvania natives have their sights set on the moon. Roderick and Randa Relich Milliron have been at work for more than 20 years on a do-it-yourself rocket system that they hope will head to the moon twice this year. Interorbital Systems, started in 1996, is part of Synergy Moon, a international collaboration of scientists and companies competing as a team to win the $20 million grand prize in Google's race to the moon. "The moon has always been our goal," Randa Milliron told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on the phone from Interorbital headquarters at the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, Calif. Five teams remain in Lunar XPRIZE. To win, a team must land on the moon, travel 500 meters across its surface and send high-definition video and images back to Earth by the end of 2017. "I know one way or another, we will do this mission," said Kevin Myrick, a founder and team leader of Synergy Moon. Astrobotic, a Carnegie Mellon University spinoff company headquartered in the Strip District, bowed out of the competition in December when CEO John Thornton said the company would not be ready for a 2017 launch. Thornton doubted any team would land on the moon in 2017. "He's a dropout," Randa Milliron said of Thornton quitting the competition and criticized him for disparaging the work of the other teams. "He knows nothing about how we're doing." Milliron, however, acknowledged that landing on the moon and completing the XPRIZE requirements by the end of the year will be tough. Space is tough, she said. "It will be close. I keep hoping they will extend the time, and I think everyone is hoping they can do that," she said. The XPRIZE has made no mention of extending the timeline. Interorbital has about 12 employees. Randa Milliron is from Belle Vernon and serves as the company's CEO. Her husband, Roderick Milliron, is from Mt. Pleasant. He is the chief designer and engineer. Roderick Milliron graduated from the University of Pittsburgh after studying applied mathematics, computer programming and physics and later worked for Grumman and General Dynamics. Randa Milliron graduated from Duquesne University with a master's degree in African language. "Kind of far flung from space endeavors," Randa Milliron joked. The Millirons were playing in an electro-industrial band in the 1980s and 1990s, splitting time between Berlin and Los Angeles, when a friend told them about a group of rocket scientists working in California's Mojave Desert. The band, H-Bomb White Noise, checked it out. There were a couple of rocket stands, a Quonset hut and "this hardcore industrial activity that sort of goes with our music," Randa Milliron said. They were hooked. "All that adventure attached to it. It was high romance. It was irresistible," Milliron said. The Millirons started spending more time in the desert with members of the Pacific Rocket Society. In 1995, they built and fired their first rocket engine. They founded Interorbital Systems a year later and had their first launch in 1999. Space travel at that time was still dominated by the government. The commercial space industry had yet to take off. "We felt kind of like pirates or renegades making these powerful machines and realizing we could do it ourselves," Randa Milliron said. "I guess it was really the beginning of the DIY or the commercial space movement." Fifteen years later, having to take jobs as movie extras at times and selling do-it-yourself satellite building kits that they will launch for $8,000 to raise money for their company, the Millirons launched their first NEPTUNE rocket component. The Millirons aren't billionaires like Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, founder of Blue Origin, or Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX. They build their rockets from the ground up in-house, using off-the-shelf, non-aerospace components whenever possible to keep the cost down. When they can't afford a part, they learn how to make it. They build modular rockets out of Common Propulsion Modules, or CPM, which are basically giant propellant containers, Randa Milliron said. Strap together three CPM and you have a NEPTUNE 3, a rocket capable of taking a 12-kilogram payload into low-Earth orbit for between $500,000 and $750,000, Randa Milliron said. Eight CMPs, a NEPTUNE 8, can carry a payload to the moon for less than $5 million, the Millirons hope. Team Synergy will use a NEPTUNE 8 for its XPRIZE flight. And to save even more money, Interorbital isn't going to launch from a traditional space port such as Vandenberg Air Force Base, about a three-hour trip along the coast from Los Angeles where a launch can cost $3 million, but from the middle of the ocean. "We are disrupters," Randa Milliron said. "We are showing this can be done at radically, radically lower costs." Myrick said there's a lot to like about Interorbital's approach to rockets. The modular design makes scaling pervious successes possible. The company's scrappy, do-it-yourself attitude allows it to offer launches at a fraction of the cost of other space companies, and it doesn't rely on venture capital for funding. Myrick said success in the XPRIZE will depend on securing enough money for the launch. He wouldn't say how much is needed. Interorbital has four high-profile launches. The company will test its guidance system this spring with a suborbital launch that will carry 11 small satellites payloads. The Millirons hope their first orbital flight will be in late summer. In the third quarter of this year, Interorbital will launch its Lunar Bullet mission, a rocket shot directly at the moon and aimed to slam into the lunar surface. The company's XPRIZE launch will happen by the end of the year, Milliron hopes. A NEPTUNE 8 rocket will fly to the moon, launch a lander that will deploy a rover to roll across the surface, snap a few photos and maybe some video, and win the $20 million Google Lunar XPRIZE in the process. But even that, Milliron said, is a test. "Everything we're doing is a test launch for the next phase," she said. The company has two more moon missions planned for 2018, one that will return samples from the moon to Earth.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 17 February 2017 | MYT 2:30 PM Facebook says Irish challenge to US data transfers ‘deeply flawed’ No big deal: Gallagher said that the level of transparency and the variety of protections in the United states "match anything in Europe" and said the court had not heard expert arguments on the quality of US privacy protections. — AFP DUBLIN: Facebook said a legal challenge against the way it transfers EU user data to the United States was "deeply flawed" and should not be referred to the EU's top court because ample privacy protections were already in place.  The challenge by the Irish data regulator is the latest to question whether methods used by large tech firms such as Google and Apple to transfer data gives EU consumers sufficient protection from US surveillance.  The issue of data privacy came to the fore after revelations in 2013 from former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass US surveillance caused political outrage in Europe.  Facebook says the case could lead to a breakdown in transatlantic data transfers that could knock EU economic output by up to 1.3%.  Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner, which regulates Facebook as its European headquarters are in Dublin, found in May that a complaint about privacy protections in mechanisms Facebook uses to transfer data were "well-founded."  It is asking the Irish High Court to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), which would then decide whether to ban the use of "model contracts" – common legal arrangements used by thousands of firms to transfer personal data outside the 28-nation bloc.  A lawyer representing Facebook told the High Court that the case by the Irish regulator was flawed because it did not take into account the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement that came into force last August to address earlier concerns about US surveillance.  Under the agreement, the replacement for the Safe Harbour agreement struck down by the CJEU in 2015, the United States agreed to limit the collection of and access to Europeans' data stored on US servers.  "How could you have a well founded concern about the protections that are available without having looked at it (privacy shield)," Paul Gallagher, representing Facebook, told the High Court.  "There should be no reference because the (Data Protection Commisioner's) decision has been overtaken by events," he said. "The decision is deeply flawed."  Gallagher said that the level of transparency and the variety of protections in the United states "match anything in Europe" and said the court had not heard expert arguments on the quality of US privacy protections.  The Irish commissioner's office initially became involved after Austrian law student and privacy activist Max Schrems made a complaint in Dublin about Facebook's handling of his data in the United States.  Schrems and other privacy campaigners contend that alternative arrangements such as model clauses don't offer Europeans any means of redress either.  A lawyer representing Schrems, James Doherty, told the court that a referral to the European Court was "unnecessary or at least premature" as the Irish regulator had not fully investigated the complaint and had not used all tools in its power to restrict data flows where consumers' rights were threatened. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks ‘Horizon Zero Dawn’ prepares for final push Carpool and save with GrabShare JPMorgan moving mortgages online to please paper-weary customers Pokémon Go: The universe expands Google adds voice-activated shopping, taking on Amazon Others Also Read With Samsung chief in jail, one-time mentor seen taking charge Mourinho fumes over attitude issues in St Etienne win Genting Highlands to house country‘s second Premium Outlet advertisement Latest News Apple to start India manufacturing in coming months with iPhone SE: source JPMorgan moving mortgages online to please paper-weary customers Pokémon Go: Tips for the Gen 2 update European parliament calls for robot law, rejects robot tax Facebook says Irish challenge to US data transfers ‘deeply flawed’ Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: Tips for the Gen 2 update The smartwatch is dead; long live the smart watch European parliament calls for robot law, rejects robot tax Uber gives restless staff a way to cash out with no IPO in sight Facebook CEO warns against reversal of global thinking Apple vowed to revolutionise TV – why hasn’t it?

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Friday February 17, 2017 News World Larger / SmallerNight Mode First fake news, then a resigned, indifferent public (just ask the Russians) Helen Womack 17 Feb 2017, 11:20 a.m. Donald Trump -- whether influenced by the Russians or from his own native talent – seems to have mastered the key defensive technique of "whataboutism". First fake news, then a resigned, indifferent public (just ask the Russians) Galina Pyshnyak recounting story about a child's crucifixion. It never happened. Photo: Liveleak A portion of the MH17 wing lies in the field as smoke rises behind the tree-line. Russians no longer know what to think. Photo: Kate Geraghty Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Budapest: Russian state television aired an interview in 2014 with a woman who claimed the Ukrainian army, entering a rebel-held town, had publicly crucified a three-year-old boy. The woman, named as Galina Pyshnyak, said she saw soldiers "take a little boy in his underwear and T-shirt and nail him to a notice board like Jesus". The story was a complete fabrication. War has always made truth its first casualty but distortion and lying are creeping into everyday life in the "post-fact" world. White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway justified the recent Muslim travel ban by inventing a "massacre" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. She later admitted she had "misspoken" in a gross exaggeration of the reality that two terrorist suspects had been arrested there. Fake news is not new – the yellow press has been deceiving us for decades – but with the decline of traditional journalism and the rise of the internet, "alternative facts" are everywhere going viral. "The conditions are right for a perfect storm of fake news," said Dean Starkman, a media specialist at the Central European University. He predicted that companies like Google and Facebook would eventually have an incentive to police it, as their own value was being eroded. Meanwhile the public was left vulnerable. "Readers will get more sophisticated about how to wade through this stuff but the onus shouldn't be on them; it isn't fair. The system has to be cleaned up structurally," he said. Russia, with its Kremlin-loyal media and army of trolls, has made a particular contribution to fake news, using not only modern technology but all the techniques for muddying the waters that were perfected by propagandists and the KGB in Soviet times. Pointing the finger, shifting the blame, twisting history to fit a certain narrative, all these techniques keep Russians in the dark while facts are reserved for the elite. President Vladimir Putin's "political technologist", Vladislav Surkov, a man with a background in the theatre, is credited with turning Russian public life into a shadow play in which all but the bravest actors are puppets. On command, the media takes up whatever is the latest "party line" – Obama bad, Trump good (for the time being). Donald Trump -- whether influenced by the Russians or from his own native talent – seems to have mastered the key defensive technique of "whataboutism". This is when an accusation is thrown back in a false parallel. Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio caught President Trump doing it when Fox News called Vladimir Putin a "killer". (A British judge concluded that the Kremlin leader probably approved the assassination of dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006.) "There are a lot of killers. We have a lot of killers. You think our country is so innocent?" asked President Trump. In answer to which Mr. Rubio tweeted: "When has a Democratic political activist been poisoned by the GOP, or vice versa? We are not the same as Putin." When has a Democratic political activists been poisoned by the GOP, or vice versa? We are not the same as #Putin. MR— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 5, 2017 The effect of this constant blurring of distinction, whipping up of outrage and dodging of responsibility is that the public loses interest and turns into an apathetic herd. Many Russians, for example, no longer care who shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 because Moscow has generated so much false "evidence" to blame the Ukrainians. "As long as it doesn't affect me," they say. Or you hear the view that "politicians are all the same", as if oranges and apples were identical fruit. "I find it disturbing," said Hungarian teacher Laszlo Kuroli, "that even the word 'politics' – think about its Greek origin – makes people shut down, as if you do something horrible and perverted when you try to discuss politics." In Hungary, as in Russia, independent media have been commandeered and NGOs are under attack. It is hard to find an objective and balanced picture anywhere. With advances in technology, the problem of fake news may get worse before it gets better, according to Professor Starkman. "Gathering and checking facts takes time," he said. "'A lie can travel halfway round the world while the truth is putting on its shoes', as the old saying goes." Professor Starkman admits that some dishonest journalists are partly to blame for the degradation of their profession. The only answer, he says, is for news organisations to invest in qualified staff. "We need more paid, professional boots on the ground, to go out and get the information." Helen Womack was a Moscow-based foreign correspondent for three decades.

Virtual reality technology makes a lot of sense for online retailers but better customer understanding is needed to make it more than a curiosity Online retailers have led the charge when it comes to the early adoption of technology to enable better customer experience. However, despite a growing appetite for VR, its use in retail has largely been a novelty. However, this is set to change. Moving beyond the hype Until recently, VR has been seen as unattainable for the masses due to cost. Comparatively few people own headsets, and only a small number of brands have actually delivered VR-based services that have truly elevated customer experience. However, this year you’ve barely been able to move for the launch of a new VR headset. From Facebook’s Oculus Rift to Microsoft’s HoloLens, the tech giants have placed their offerings firmly on the table, while the likes of Google and Samsung have released headsets that are significantly cheaper than early concepts. When VR meets CX At the same time, consumers are expecting and demanding better, more immersive and ultimately more rewarding customer experience. This includes a desire for fewer human-to-human interactions and a preference for self-service. According to Oracle research, 34 percent of online retailers admit their customers prefer to make purchases or resolve a service issue without speaking with a member of the sales or customer service team. Consumers want brand interactions on their own terms, and only when they need them. In response retailers are waking up to the importance of VR and other emerging technologies in revolutionizing customer experience both online and in-store. It could provide differentiation and strengthen retailers’ rapport with consumers. In a world where customer expectations are changing at a faster pace than ever before, retailers need to start thinking like technology companies. There are some innovative and technology savvy retailers are rising to the challenge and starting to dip their toes into the VR water. John Lewis in the UK for example has incorporated two VR experiences into its 2016 Christmas campaign activity. Others retailers are ramping up their investments in new technologies to provide the kind of customer experience consumers want. Seventy four percent of retailers responding to a recent Oracle study confirmed that they already have or are planning to implement VR by 2020. A similar proportion of retailers plan to invest in chatbots, automation and purpose-built mobile apps in a bid to transform customer experience and bring it in line with customer expectations. Getting up to scratch with customer understanding Whilst the plans retailers have to invest in emerging technology is exciting, many are still struggling to get a single view of their customers. According to Oracle’s research, just over a third (39 percent) of respondents regularly draw on data from multiple sources to predict customer behavior and tailor their approach accordingly. And just 41 percent are including social and CRM data in their customer analytics. Retailers need to ensure they have a fully-functioning data strategy, one that unites the sales, service and marketing functions and allows information to flow freely between all CX teams, if they are to make the most of emerging technology. This smarter use of customer data will give them the insight to develop and launch customer experiences that feel like they’ve been designed personally for each consumer. It will also help them to capture the attention of their target audience through immersive shopping experiences and seamless customer interactions. If retailers can get the data side right, the opportunities are huge. It could lead to the development customer experiences based on VR and other emerging technologies that retailers – and consumers – could only ever have imagined.

For this reason, the search engine giant has turned its signature doodle into an interactive game that tells the tale of two long-distance pangolin soulmates whose undying love is now in your hands. “The most awesome stage” Last year, Facebook's VP of Design thought the TNW Conference main stage was the best she'd ever been on. FIND OUT WHY The animated game takes one of the pangolin lovers on a journey through Ghana, India and China to teach them how to best romance their partner. In the process, the scaly creature learns how to make a chocolate cake with love, how to craft a truly romantic melody, and how to dance to the rhythm of the heart. The Doodle-game finishes once the pangolin has mastered and delivered all of these romantic gestures to its fellow soulmate. While pangolins are better known as the only scaly mammals on Earth, they remain in dire danger of extinction as a result of detrimentally illegal practices like poaching and trafficking. When threatened, the scaly critters curl up into a tight ball of sharp-scaled tails that serve as protection. Learn more about the pangolins at the dedicated World Wildlife Fund page.

The Loon balloon project is part of X, the experimental division of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Now in its fourth year, the engineers at Loon say their new machine learning techniques significantly shorten their timeline for launching the project. Initially, engineers proposed that the Loon balloons would float around the globe and that they would have to find a way to keep the balloons a safe traveling distance apart and replace a balloon that drifted from an area that needed connectivity. Now, the team says they’ve found a way to keep the balloons in a much more concentrated location, thanks to their improved altitude control and navigation system. Loon says that balloons will now make small loops over a land mass, instead of circumnavigating the whole planet. “The reason this is so exciting is we can now run an experiment and try to give services in particular places of the world with 10 or 20 or 30 balloons, not with 200 or 300 or 400 balloons,” said the head of X, Astro Teller, at a press event at X’s headquarters in Mountain View today. The Loon balloons now also adjust how they fly as needed using artificial intelligence software, instead of a set navigation plan. “We’ve actually made so much progress that we think our timeline for when we can provide useful internet service to people is much, much sooner,” said Sal Candido, an engineer on the Loon project. Alphabet has been investing in Loon to make it work, but whether the balloons will be cheaper than building infrastructure in remote areas that lack connectivity remains to be seen. Internet providers generally won’t lay cables in places where there aren’t enough potential subscribers to make it profitable, which is one reason a lot of the world is still offline. The bulk of Loon’s testing has been in South America, according to Teller. Loon shared the story of its 98-day flight over Peru last September. And that same month, Loon balloons were spotted drifting over Yellowstone National Park. Watch a video about Loon’s improved navigation techniques. Correction: This article previously stated that Alphabet has been spending more than $1 billion on Loon. That figure, from a 2014 WSJ article, referred to Google’s spending plans for a satellite-based internet project.

Again,” said Trevor Noah. “Something you’d see before a pay-per-view boxing event,” said Jimmy Kimmel. But, wait, there are more. “This was just him by himself,” said Stephen Colbert. “Evidently he didn’t even bring his meds with him.” “Historically bizarre,” James Corden said. “I mean, it was bizarre even by Trump standards.” “President Trump gave his first solo press conference today and all of America quietly moved to the other end of the subway car,” Meyers summed up. “‘Maybe he’ll just get off at the next stop.’” So, okay, it was perhaps unorthodox, maybe even a little offputting in style. But there was substance, right? And you have to deal with the substance. Item 1: Trump talked again about the November election, claiming incorrectly that his “306” electoral college votes gave him the biggest victory margin since Ronald Reagan’s. Actually, he got 304 votes, and an NBC reporter pointed out that his vote tally was behind those won by George H.W. Bush (426) and Barack Obama both times (365 and 332). “You’re like somebody who wants a birthday month,” Meyers said. “Your birthday is over. Get to work.” “He said Hillary Clinton’s name 11 times,” Corden said. “Even lovesick teenage boys are like, ‘Move on.’” “Wait,” said Colbert, in a tone of wonder. “Do you think 306 is larger than 365? Wow, Betsy DeVos works quick.” “If you can’t trust your president to get the right information on a Google-able fact,” Noah said, “then can you really trust him on the harder stuff, which, by the way, is everything else the president of the United States has to deal with?” Item 2: When corrected by the reporter, Trump said others had given him the electoral college information. “Reminds me of Harry Truman,” Colbert said, “who so famously said, ‘Look, I don’t know where it’s supposed to stop. I was given that buck.’” Item 3: Trump fretted that the press would portray the news conference as him “ranting and raving.” “What president hasn't had to say 'I'm not ranting and raving'?” asked Meyers. “Who could forget Lincoln's Tirade at Gettysburg, or FDR's fireside meltdowns, and of course, Ronald Reagan famously saying, 'Mr Gorbachev, if you don't tear down this (expletive) wall I'm gonna lose my (expletive)!'" Item 4: Trump asked a black reporter to set up a meeting for him with the Congressional Black Caucus, after first asking her if the caucus members were friends of hers. “‘And while you’re at it, by the way,’” Noah imagined Trump saying, “I’ve been trying to get in touch with Frederick Douglass. Can you invite him to the meeting, too?’” Colbert, too, imagined Trump speaking: “‘Oh, you’re a black woman. Could you talk to the Congressional Black Caucus? … You know what? Forget it. I’ll have Ben Carson do it.’” "It's racist to assume all black people know each other,” Meyers said. “You don't know all orange people. ‘Hey, Donald, can you set up a meeting with Snooki and the Lorax?’" Item 5: The president talked again about how he is great for TV ratings. “‘The Bachelor’ also gets great ratings,” Jimmy Fallon said. “That doesn’t mean Nick should be president.” Item 6: This litany could go on, but -- with the memory of President Trump having invoked the possibility of a nuclear holocaust still rattling around in our skulls -- we’ll call it a night with this one. Trump said that when he came into office, he had “inherited a mess.” “No,” said Colbert. “You inherited a fortune. We elected a mess.” sajohnson@chicagotribune.com Twitter: @StevenKJohnson     RELATED STORIES: Trump says there are 2 Chicagos: One safe, one worse than the Middle East John Oliver's back with a plan to enter President Trump's info-stream Just the jokes: Late-night comedy responds to the Trump election Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.

The symposium, hosted by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, will open on March 10 under the title of "Air Of Culture: Architecture" at Dongdaemun Plaza in Seoul. Five guest speakers from overseas will talk about the cultural aspects of architecture and preservation of old historic buildings. Speakers include British designer Thomas Heatherwick, who designed many globally notable projects including London's red two-story bus New Routemater and the UK's Pavilion "Seed Cathedral" at the Shanghai Expo in 2010. He is currently working on the new Google Headquarters in Mountain View, California with Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG). Winy Maas is also one of the attendees. He co-founded the Netherlands-based architecture and urban design company MVRDV which, among other things, designed the Logrono Eco-City in Spain. He is involved in Seoul city's ambitious project of transforming an old bridge near Seoul Station into a park. Fleur Pellerin, a Korean adoptee and former French Minister of Culture and Communications, is expected to make a speech on her country's policy and vision on architecture. In September, the 27th International Union of Architects (UIA) Congress will take place in the city. The non-governmental organization will run academic programs for Sept. 3-10 on research and architectural designs on the Congress' theme of "Soul of the City."    There will be numerous sessions daily on extensive subjects ranging from Virtual Reality (VR) in architecture to urban regeneration and new city development strategy for developing countries.

As first spotted by The Digital Lifestyle, Alexa can now be connected to your Microsoft account for keeping track of upcoming meetings and other events on your calendar. All you have to do to get started is head into the settings portion of the Alexa app or website and click on Calendar. From there, you'll see the option to connect either a Google or Microsoft account. Just click on the Microsoft option and you'll be prompted to log in and give the necessary permissions for the integration to work. Using an Amazon Echo with Windows 10 is easy! Previously, only Google accounts were supported, so this is a big deal for anyone who relies on Microsoft's ecosystem for managing their various calendars. And while it is possible to migrate Outlook calendars over to Gmail, not everyone is willing or able to abandon Outlook for the sake of Echo integration. See at Amazon Like us!

One can tell that Amazon's Alexa AI is pulling away from both Microsoft's Cortana and iOS' Siri, by the sheer amount of OEM third party devices that plug into Alexa/Amazon's Echo,  that were on view during this past CES trade show.   Who knew even two years ago, that Amazon, in both cloud computing *and* the AI areas, would end up becoming one of Microsoft's largest competitors. 0 12 hours ago Reply psurob55 Nice. Just outlook.com I assume? No exchange? 0 14 hours ago Reply DLong4 My Alexa iOS app linked to Outlook right away. I am concerned, though, with the popup message which said "Do you wish for the app to access your calendars/emails/contacts/phone info/etc? These can be changed later in the settings." I looked briefly in the privacy settings but didn't see the breach. Any pointers appreciated in just allowing Alexa to see the Outlook calendars. 0 1 day ago Reply InlineV I'm a Prime customer but I find it increasingly difficult to justify that.

That and I feel like a vast number of features of Cortana either don't work or aren't what I expect them to be. For instance the food section of the notebook asks what food you like and when you usually eat lunch. Now I would assume this means that when it comes close to your usual lunch time Cortana will pipe up and let you know that X food interest is in such and such location nearby. This has never, ever happened. In fact outside of telling me when to leave for work Cortana has never been proactive about anything. 1 2 days ago Reply breaker119 I believe the lunch inquiry has to do with scheduling things on your calendar 1 2 days ago Reply emigrating You can switch profiles on the Echo.

Had ours since April 2016. I'm embarrassed to say we use it to shut off various lights in the house (especially at night), turn on the garage heater early in the morning, set alarms while we are cooking, answer Wikipedia-ish questions, order pizza and Uber, etc. It's to the point where you "expect" the TV to turn the volume down by asking Alexa to handle it for you. Ridiculous, scary, and effective all at once. 1 2 days ago Reply emigrating My 5 year old has got to the point he walks into his room and asks Alexa to turn his light on - knowing full well I haven't got around to smarten up his room yet. 1 1 day ago Reply dakranii You're right, I was unintentionally unfair. I don't have a smart home at this point, so my options for Alexa are much more limited than yours. I envision getting there at some point, which was part of why I wanted Alexa. My original point in posting wasn't to disparage Alexa but rather state my desire for a Cortana device since I use Cortana services. 1 1 day ago Reply Twitter JohnB_123 Ahh I see. Yeah, home tech moves way too fast to be locked in to one platform. And the good stuff integrates well anyway. Alexa is such a thing --Cortana's integration capability looks like the W10M app store vs. Alexa's -- not even close, and the gap expands every day. Both my parents and my wife's bought them and quickly added smarthome tech to it. Both in their mid-70's, and both did it as first timers. That's saying something. Go get one (perhaps a $25 smart plug) and play. 0 1 day ago Reply InlineV That must have been a bitter pill for Amazon to swallow.

By Corinne Reichert | February 17, 2017 -- 05:34 GMT (21:34 PST) | Topic: Tech Industry Village Roadshow has announced its new plan for combating piracy through a five-part strategy, as well as its intent to pursue website blocks against a further 40 foreign sites that facilitate the infringement of copyright this month. Latest Australian news ​NAB to create new digital platform for healthcare ​ANZ says Apple Pay, Android Pay instrumental in Q1 customer acquisition NBN changes CVC pricing model from industry average to RSP average ​Australian government to review its AU$6.2b annual IT spend Telstra cites 'intense competition' after profit drop to AU$1.8b During its financial results presentation on Friday, Village Roadshow said piracy is impacting its cinema and film distribution businesses, and hailed the impact of its success in getting the Australian Federal Court to compel internet service providers to block piracy websites including The Pirate Bay, Torrentz, isoHunt, and TorrentHound and streaming site Solarmovie in December. "Using bipartisan legislation, access to The Pirate Bay website has been blocked, resulting in a dramatic reduction in downloads from that site," the company said. "In February, will initiate the blocking of a further 40 pirate sites, constituting approximately 90 percent of the flow." Village Roadshow's new five-point program for combating piracy involves suing infringers; blocking sites; getting Google to take down or demote the ranking in its search results for piracy websites; a "major PR campaign"; and ensuring the availability of legal products. It is hoping for a similar outcome to that attained in South Korea, which experienced an 89.8 percent decrease in piracy following legal action and was resultant in driving box office and movie distribution profits. (Image: Screenshot by Corinne Reichert/ZDNet) Foxtel and Roadshow's Australian case set the precedent for content owners to seek injunctions against ISPs, ordering them to block access to foreign piracy websites at the cost of the copyright owners. The blocks are obtainable under the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Act 2015, which passed both houses of parliament in mid-2015 and allows rights holders to obtain a court order to block websites hosted overseas that are deemed to exist for the primary purpose of infringing or facilitating infringement of copyright. Roadshow applied to block websites using the legislation a year ago, in February 2016, which was followed by an almost year-long court case that debated DNS blocking, the cost of the blocks, and possible workarounds to any website blocks. The domain name blocks appeared soon after the judgment, but are simple to bypass if users point their DNS entries at services such as Google Public DNS instead of their ISP's domain name servers. Village Roadshow co-CEO Graham Burke told ZDNet back in 2014: "We make AU$2.6 billion worth of films in Australia. If the piracy thing is not nailed, it's over, mate. O-V-E-R." Village Roadshow is also hedging its bets by making AU$20,000 in political donations directly to the local Labor branch of Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, who would be responsible for overseeing many of the regulations and laws that Village Roadshow could take advantage of in its attempts to stymie online piracy under a Labor government. Meanwhile, the federal government itself has been publishing research revealing that the rate of piracy has "significantly" declined organically due to the availability of legal streaming services such as Netflix. Village Roadshow reported a net loss of AU$6.71 million, almost double last year's net loss of AU$3.46 million, on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) of AU$78.4 million for the first half of FY17, and revenue of AU$542.5 million.

Sidharth, an alumnus, of Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, is a final year student of Computer Science at the DTU. The highest offer of international placement made so far in DTU campus is Rs 1.25 crore per annum. Chetan Kakkar of the 2015 batch was offered the package by search giant Google. “I am looking forward to groom my technological skills at Uber before I begin brainstorming on my start-up plan which I see as a long-term goal,” Sidharth told PTI. The 22-year-old student’s father works as a consultant while his mother works transcripts speeches as a freelancer. This comes right after Uber announced that it will start mapping Asian roadways from 13 February. The first such program will be launched in Singapore. Understandably, the company claims that maps are very important for a good Uber experience. They need to know how to get somewhere, what traffic patterns are like, etc. In a blog post, Uber says that while existing maps are serviceable, they’re not good enough for its needs, which is why it needs to start mapping things out on its own. The mapping data will be collected by Uber’s driver partners in Singapore, who will use specially kitted out vehicles for the same.

And now this week, the show goes full-bore Green Arrow with an episode about gun violence. Or maybe Star Trek, since they share a title, but it doesn’t look like Ollie gets stranded on a half-completed set. No, instead, some garden variety terrorist with an AK-47 shoots up the mayor’s office, giving Ollie a change in terms of guilt trips. While this nod to the comic’s past as being unafraid to tackle, or sometimes blunder right into, serious social issues is welcome, um, Ollie, you have two coworkers who run around with firearms. Also, you go crashing into other people’s offices spraying projectiles everywhere all the time, so maybe a little self-awareness would be appropriate here? That said, hey, at least they get points for effort. While hopefully they acknowledge their limits as an action show, where a lot of people get shot, they’re still trying to ask themselves a few questions. We’ll see how it works tonight at 8pm EST on the CW. Join us, won’t you?

Profile By: indieguy 02.15.2017 @ 8:57 PM that kid is painfully white Profile By: Kevin the Robot 02.15.2017 @ 8:56 PM So a guy who is assistant to the deputy mayor can’t get custody of his kid back. By: Dan Seitz 02.15.2017 @ 8:57 PM And the fact he got his kid taken away is not a scandal. Profile By: Jonno 02.15.2017 @ 8:59 PM Star City has low standards. Pretty much whoever shows up and isn’t killed gets the job. By: Dan Seitz 02.15.2017 @ 8:56 PM That’s your origin? You saw a riot and a superhero and got inspired to dress like a serial killer from the movies and shoot people?!

By: Dan Seitz 02.15.2017 @ 8:53 PM I like how Vigilante was literally in this episode to just remind us he was there. By: Dan Seitz 02.15.2017 @ 8:50 PM So Ollie never has to worry about his “numbers” ever again.

LET’S NOT TALK ABOUT THAT AT ALL!” Profile By: Jonno 02.15.2017 @ 8:48 PM I really hope the episode doesn’t end with Curtis getting shot and poochie saying “you were right the whole time, I see that now.” By: Dan Seitz 02.15.2017 @ 8:47 PM It’s really sad that Gotham is literally handling modern politics better than Arrow.

Profile By: Kevin the Robot 02.15.2017 @ 8:45 PM I’m guessing he was on probation and he went to jail for having drugs or a gun in his apartment.

By: Dan Seitz 02.15.2017 @ 8:20 PM Not to get political here, but to be real, to talk about this honestly, you need to delve into things like domestic violence, the mental health system, and the disaster that is background check enforcement, and this show is just not equipped for that at ALL. Profile By: indieguy 02.15.2017 @ 8:21 PM but stats! Profile By: Jonno 02.15.2017 @ 8:24 PM Agreed, I support the message, but this show doesn’t really have the legs to make a case here.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas February 17, 2017 06:54 GMT Close Who is PewDiePie? The world’s biggest YouTuber IBTimes UK YouTube's biggest star Felix 'PewDiePie' Kjellberg has apologised for anti-Semitic content in his recent videos, but slammed the media for allegedly misrepresenting him and taking the jokes "out of context". Earlier this week, Disney and Google's YouTube cut ties with the 27-year-old Swede after the Wall Street Journal reported that he posted nine videos over the last six months that featured anti-Semitic jokes, Nazi imagery, swastikas, a Nazi salute and clips of Hitler. While one video posted on 11 January showed two men holding a banner that read, "Death to all Jews" while laughing and dancing, another posted on 22 January featured a man dressed as Jesus Christ saying: "Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong." The popular YouTuber, who rose to fame posting videos of himself playing and reacting to video games, earned around $15m (£12m) last year, according to Forbes, and currently has over 53.3 million subscribers on YouTube. In an 11-minute video titled, My Response, Kjellberg apologised for the "Death to all Jews" video and reiterated that the incident was intended to "show how stupid the website is and how far you can push it by paying $5". "I am sorry for the words I used as I know they offended people and I admit that the joke itself went too far," he said. "I do strongly believe that you can joke about anything. But I also believe there's a right way and not the best way to joke about things. I love to push boundaries but I would consider myself a rookie comedian and I've definitely made mistakes before. "But it's always been a growing and learning experience for me... I don't want people to think that I can joke about what I want and it doesn't affect me [because] I'm PewDiePie. I understand these things have consequences. This video is not me trying to justify that." YouTuber PewDiePie has apologised for his controversial anti-Semitic content but slammed the media for allegedly taking the jokes out of contextYouTube/PewDiePie Kjellberg also accused the Wall Street Journal, which broke the news of Disney severing ties with him, of taking what he said "out of context" to Disney and YouTube "obviously cornering them and forcing them to sever their ties with me". The YouTuber slammed the incident as an "attack" by the mainstream media "to try and discredit me, decrease my influence and my economic worth". "Old-school media does not like internet personalities because they are scared of us," Kjellberg said. "We have so much influence and such a large voice, and I don't think they understand that," he said. While Kjellberg acknowledged that he "took things too far", he said the reaction and outrage to the incident has been "nothing but insanity". "It's fine to not agree with a person's sense of humor, but calling me a fascist... how is that helping anyone?" "If there's anything I've learned about the media from being a public figure is how they blatantly misrepresent people for their own personal gain," he continued. "[They] even viciously attack people just to further themselves." The Journal pointed out that Kjellberg's content and videos have found favour with neo-Nazi websites including the Daily Stormer which posted a banner on their site shortly after his video was posted in January. The banner reads: "The world's #1 PewDiePie fansite." "He could be doing all this only to cause a stir things up and get free publicity," the Daily Stormer wrote. "Ultimately, it doesn't matter, since the effect is the same; it normalises Nazism, and marginalises our enemies." Kjellberg previously said that he does not support "any kind of hateful attitudes" nor does he support "these people in any way". Towards the end of the video, Kjellberg tears up and thanks supporters who stood by him. He concludes with a message to the Journal saying: "I'm still here, I'm still making videos. Nice try, Wall Street Journal. Try again, motherf***ers!" before flipping them the finger."

Speakers and panelists lined up for the event will span the journalism career spectrum with broadcast, print, digital and social media specialists ranging from the New York Times and ESPN to the Associated Press and Google.  New York Times reporter and former social media editor Daniel Victor will present on using social media as a reporting tool from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. in the Overby Center Auditorium. Associated Press journalist and author Jesse Holland will present on his experiences from writing news to writing nonfiction to writing about superheroes from 10:45 a.m. to noon in the Overby Center Conference Room 249. Several others, including resident Ole Miss professors Deb Wenger and Ji Hoon Heo, will present on modern journalism multimedia tools. AP sports reporter David Brandt, The Undefeated’s Aaron Dodson and Grind City Media’s Michael Wallace will be a part of a panel discussion on the challenges and opportunities of sports journalism and will answer questions from 11 a.m. to noon in Farley Auditorium. During the conference, which runs Thursday evening through Saturday afternoon, two regional awards ceremonies will be conducted. Jerry Mitchell of The Clarion-Ledger is the keynote speaker for the Best of the South awards banquet. The Best of the South awards honor work published, aired or posted in 2016. Categories include Best News Writer, Best Features Writer and Best Magazine Design, as well as awards in radio and television reporting. Awards will also be given out for on-site competitions that begin Thursday. Awards will be given in 15 different categories for work produced under deadline pressure during the conference, like taking photographs at an Oxford Film Festival event or writing a coverage story of Thursday night’s basketball game. The conference is held in a different location in the Southeast every year, and this year, the university has the honor of hosting for the first time since 2008. “Hosting a conference like this requires a ton of work spread over more than a year,” said Patricia Thompson, assistant dean of the Meek School of Journalism and New Media and the 2017 SEJC president. “We agreed quite a few years ago to have the 2017 conference here, and there are so many things you can’t control or predict when you say OK to hosting a conference years in the future.” Thompson said no one expected the Student Union to be closed for construction at the time the conference was scheduled. She also said there are many variables but you have to plan for the best and go with the flow. “The bottom line is we have a great schedule of workshops and presentations,” Thompson said. “We have volunteer help from many students and faculty. Our visitors are looking forward to coming to Oxford, and we are proud to show off our campus, our school and our student media.” For the full schedule of events, check out thedmonline.com for more information. <a href="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=3af71d2512&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" > <img src="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538492949&cs=3af71d2512&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=91bce26ae3&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" > <img src="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538492950&cs=91bce26ae3&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="10" alt=""></a> <a href="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d743236dae&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" > <img src="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538492951&cs=d743236dae&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="10" alt=""></a> Pin It Advertise Online Advertising Archives February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 DM RSS Gas line ruptured at new STEM building on Oxford campus Leaking National Spillway Rebels are on the outside looking in with regards to NCAA Tournament Ole Miss Student Health Center sees decrease after recent flu spike ‘Let’s go time traveling’: University Wax Museum brings black history to life Actor Danny Glover to speak, attend Oxford Film Fest this Friday Is church the place to talk about politics?

While it would later go on to break that promise, HTC has slowly and steadily released Android 7.0 Nougat for its devices. Now, the Sprint variant of the One A9 will finally receive the update, making it that much sweeter. The Nougat update is now rolling out over the air and will hit Sprint A9's over the next couple of weeks. If you are not willing to wait and simply want the update now, you can head to HTC's support page that offers a walkthrough of how to manually download and install the update onto your device. If going this route, be careful and make sure you back up all your important information, as the update will wipe out all your data. If you don't yet own the device but you're interested in it, you can now purchase the HTC One A9 for $299.99. This applies to the unlocked version and carriers' variants for Sprint, AT&T, and T-Mobile. If you're looking for something newer, HTC has recently announced its Ultra U handset that offers a secondary display but will come at a hefty price of $749.

Founded in 2012, HackerOne provides companies like YouPorn an easy way to implement a bug bounty program, allowing hackers a secure and safe way of reporting vulnerabilities in exchange for payment. Like pornography, bug bounty programs are big business, with companies like Facebook, Apple and Google having paid out millions of dollars in exchange for the safe disclosure of vulnerabilities on their platforms. Vice President of YouPorn Brad Burns pointed out that YouPorn does have its own security staff, but went on to say: ...vulnerabilities and breaches are ongoing, so it is important to continuously stay as many steps ahead of potential online threats as possible. We encourage researchers to reach out and let us know if they find any potential issues, and we will be happy to work to resolve the issue quickly. We guarantee that they are to be fairly rewarded for their time and effort. With over one billion video views per month, it's understandable that YouPorn want to limit both downtime and any harm to its brand that could arise from a hack. YouPorn is a sister company of Pornhub, which launched its own bug bounty program last year. YouPorn is offering rewards of between $50 and $25,000 for each safely reported vulnerability. So, next time you're sat in a cafe and the bearded guy near you is viewing a porn site, don't judge. He might just be looking for a security hole.

As stated by Bloomberg, the efforts of over 100 engineers at the Shenzhen offices in China are aimed squarely at Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant, “not smaller players” a person familiar with the matter is reported to have said. There is, however, a slight difference, as this digital assistant would only communicate in Chinese languages and target the domestic market. This strategic move is in light of the fact that many of Google’s services that come pre-installed on Android (the dominant smartphone OS) are actually blocked in the Asian country. The voice assistant would give Huawei a way to stand out from its competitors in the region. Despite working on its homegrown assistant, Huawei will continue to work closely with Google and Amazon’s Alexa outside of China.

Even though it was absent from the list, users were still hoping there would be a way to get the latest OS for Sony’s SmartWatch 3. We now have confirmation from the company that this is not the case. According to Xperia Blog, the fine print on the product page of the SmartWatch 3 explicitly states the device supports up to version 1.5 of Android wear, with "Android Wear 2.0 and onwards" not being supported. It goes without saying that owners of this model are not at all pleased by the news, going so far as to create a petition , hoping to change Google and Sony’s stance on this issue. It’s currently sitting just 184 shy of its 2500 signature goal.

Now, it looks like that functionality is starting to be rolled out and tested, even though it can’t actually be used just yet. Inquisitive folks looking at a beta version of Google Assistant found last month that there were mentions of mobile payments inside of the app and support for extending that functionality to other devices, like Google Home. All of that seems to now be confirmed with some beta users seeing a new Payments option in their applications. Select Pixel owners using the latest beta version of the app are reporting they can now sign up for a Payments program and save their credit card information inside of Google Assistant. From there the data can be shared with other devices, like Google Home. More intriguingly, we’re likely to see this functionality on the recently launched LG Watch models, which also support Google Assistant. As you can see from the screenshots above, users need to agree to terms and conditions, including those for Google Express, the company’s home delivery service which is only available in select locations. Payment itself is currently not possible through Assistant, likely because Google hasn’t made this API available just yet. Android Pay, the company’s other payment service, is being considerably expanded around the world, but given Assistant’s tie-in with Express, we might not see this new functionality be available quite so broadly. In either case, we’re likely to learn more in the near future as Google’s Assistant is rumored to be coming to more devices, like the LG G6 for example, and as the company continues to compete with Amazon and Apple, its main rivals in this area.

High-frequency trading firms have even built such analysis into their trading strategies. Then along came @real­donaldtrump. A month into Donald Trump’s presidency, the best algorithmic minds on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are still scrambling to come to grips with the phenomenon. “Trump’s tweeting habits seem to be as erratic as everything else about him,” Max Braun, an employee of the Google-affiliated research laboratory known as X, said in a recent interview. Braun has built an automated bot — Trump2Cash — that analyzes Trump’s tweets and then automatically places a trade on the companies the president names. But like others in his field, Braun has learned that Trump’s behavior on social media does not always play out the way the science would predict. After the president criticized Nordstrom for dropping his daughter’s clothing line, the bot predicted that Trump’s negative comments about the retailer would cause its stock price to go down, but instead it rose 4.2 percent by the end of the trading day. As of Thursday, however, the bot’s overall returns are in the green, according to a benchmark Braun is keeping. The science of trading based on Twitter predates Trump. Yet the president “is a volatility machine,” said Joe Gits, the chief executive of Social Market Analytics, which produces automated analysis of social media for professional investors. “He generates more volatility than anything in the world right now, so these stocks are going to move one way or the other.” Gits noted that in the long run — or even within a few weeks — almost all the companies that have been hit by Trump’s jabs appeared to have recovered from the damage, suggesting that investors are discounting Trump’s resolve to act against the companies. Shares of Boeing, which was attacked by Trump in December over the cost of producing Air Force One, initially dropped in price, but they are now 12 percent higher than they were on the day of the tweet. But Gits said that any firm doing short-term trading had to take Trump’s statements into account. It has not been easy. In the seconds after Trump’s Nordstrom tweet, for instance, before people would have had enough time to respond, it was evident that automated trading algorithms had crunched the information and begun either selling or betting against the stock. The company’s share price fell 1 percent within a minute. But that decline quickly reversed, and by the end of the day the stock had made strong gains. That complicated response is, in part, a result of the fact that professional traders are not the only ones trying to play the Trump markets — tens of thousands of armchair investors are watching the president’s account and placing trades. Rachel Mayer is the co-founder of a New York startup, Trigger Finance, that creates automatic trading triggers for small-time investors, based on real-world events. The company has created triggers for all sorts of market-­moving signals — such as changes in Federal Reserve policy and big stock price moves — but the triggers that Mayer’s company has built around Trump’s Twitter account have been by far the most popular, gaining 10,000 subscribers. Mayer, who used to be a currency trader at JPMorgan Chase, said there were a number of indications that many of her subscribers saw the tweet about Nordstrom and decided to buy the stock as a form of protest, just as many consumers said they would support the store after the president’s attack. Mayer said that over time the market responses to Trump’s proclamations seemed to be more restrained, which may reflect a recognition that the president’s bark is worse than his bite. “The market doesn’t seem to think that he’s going to do anything else except complain,” she said. Trump2Cash, Braun’s bot, is set to hold the stock only until the end of the same trading day as the tweet. If the sentiment is negative, it places a short sale, or a bet that the price will fall, to take advantage of the stock going down. Braun has continually tweaked the rules governing Trump2Cash. He has, for instance, programmed the bot to ignore mentions of media companies because they amounted to more market noise than signal. But Braun says he will not mind if the bot ends up losing money — he is thinking about Trump2Cash as more of an art project than an investing strategy, and he plans to donate any money he makes from the few thousand dollars he has invested to Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, as a rebuke to Trump’s politics. “I have a very particular set of skills, skills that allow me to have some fun with Trump’s emotional incontinence and maybe effect positive change along the way,” Braun wrote in a Medium post introducing the bot.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Emily Marko always has been a creative and visual learner. The Scott woman knew this as she approached college and, later, the workforce. Marko graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate's degree in graphic communications, then earned her bachelor's in graphic design from La Roche College in 2001. She worked at different jobs in corporate training, higher education, furniture retail and, eventually, an NFL team, finding with each position a commonality in the challenges faced and the tools she employed to overcome them. In 2010 she became involved with International Forum of Visual Practitioners, or IFVP. These professionals use custom visuals, diagrams, illustrations, storyboards, mapping systems, drawings and more to capture information, communicate ideas, and stimulate creative thinking. Working online and in person, they have been used to consult and coach for the business world, government organizations, nonprofits and educational institutions and with clients such as the National Park Service, Stanford University, Google, eBay and the National Science Foundation. Today's global marketplace has people with different communication styles, cultural backgrounds and native languages. While words can be misinterpreted, images are universal and when a visual practitioner captures a conversation or facilitates a session, team members and employees can see that their ideas are being understood and incorporated. Marko continued researching graphic recording and visual thinking and then used these skills and her passion for storytelling to open her own business in 2012. She has held public workshops most often at the Whetstone Workgroup in Sharpsburg, but most often facilitates private workshops with groups such as educators for professional development days, students for classroom projects, and businesses that are serious about fostering and supporting their employees' development planning. “My business and its visual storytelling process provide a clearly defined action plan that helps to fuel forward progress,” Marko said. This means setting goals, expanding ideas, defining a process, and visualizing words and the core of a business. She offers specific packages for both individuals and groups. “My clients have amazing ideas. My mission is to help people solve problems and share their stories so they can change the world.” For more information, visit emilymarko.com. Charlotte Smith is a Tribune-Review contributing writer.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 17 February 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM Uber gives restless staff a way to cash out with no IPO in sight by eric newcomer Some terms and conditions: Fewer than 200 of the some 10,000 people employed by Uber currently qualify for the programme, the person said. — Reuters Many longtime employees of Uber Technologies Inc are multi-millionaires, at least on paper. But with no initial public offering in sight and a strict policy blocking most private share sales, they’re stuck in limbo.  However, there’s a little-known option available to Uber loyalists looking to cash out. Those who work at the San Francisco company for at least four years can sell as much as 10% of their shares, people familiar with the matter said.  The programme has a built-in incentive to entice staff to stick around. The seller gets paid out over many months and must remain at Uber during that time, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorised to discuss the program publicly.  The formal plan, which has been in effect for a couple years but was previously unreported, caps buybacks at well below US$10mil (RM44.53mil) per employee, one of the people said. Fewer than 200 of the some 10,000 people employed by Uber currently qualify for the programme, the person said. A spokesman for Uber declined to comment.  Although well-compensated by any rational standard, startup employees often take pay cuts compared with what they could receive at Facebook Inc or Google. They join knowing a chunk of their pay is tied to the fortunes of their employer and could become worthless. What many workers hadn’t bargained for was how long they’d have to wait to find out what would happen.  With the exception of Snap Inc and a few others, technology companies are waiting much longer to go public than in the past, and the ample funding available from private investors at generous terms have made mergers a less attractive option. As a result, exits have been cut almost in half from their high in late 2015, according to the Bloomberg US Startups Barometer, an index that tracks private markets.  When Emil Michael, Uber’s senior vice-president of business, takes the stage at a Goldman Sachs conference Wednesday, don’t expect him to address a topic on the minds of many employees: when exactly the company will go public.  The ride-hailing giant has raised more than US$17bil (RM75.70bil) in cash and debt since its founding in 2009. It had more than US$11bil (RM49.01bil) on its balance sheet as of June, the last time it disclosed the amount. But it’s spent aggressively since then, despite offloading its money pit in China to homegrown app Didi Chuxing.  Airbnb Inc and Pinterest Inc were founded around the same time as Uber, achieved valuations in excess of US$10bil (RM44.56bil) and yet remain private. But the two companies have at times allowed their employees to sell shares to interested buyers and even facilitated some of those transactions.  Uber, the world’s most valuable tech startup at US$69bil (RM307.46bil), has been more restrictive about who gets to buy its shares.  While Uber’s buyback approach can help it retain talent, it may also benefit the company’s bottom line. Using its own money, Uber purchases common stock for 25% to 35% less than the price of preferred shares from its most recent funding round, one person familiar with the matter said. It can then turn around and sell shares at a premium in a subsequent round. Still, an employee who got their stock four years ago stands to make more than a 10-fold increase on the sale.  As some gold rushers watch their paper wealth soar, option holders face colossal tax bills on their stock, regardless of whether they can sell it. In late 2014, Uber began offering employees restricted stock units instead of options, which don't require paying taxes upfront, one of the people said.  Employee demand to sell stock would be one factor that could ultimately motivate Uber to go public, but buybacks reduce some of the pressure. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Verizon close to Yahoo deal, price cut of US$250mil-US$350mil: sources Google adds voice-activated shopping, taking on Amazon Hackers shift tactics after 2016 US election: CrowdStrike Apple to start India manufacturing in coming months with iPhone SE: source Cyber warriors see politics muddying security efforts SMBC head says will give Toshiba as much support as possible Others Also Read Places to go on a weekend Mixed reactions to ban Winter schedule played part in Liverpool slump, says Klopp advertisement Latest News Apple to start India manufacturing in coming months with iPhone SE: source JPMorgan moving mortgages online to please paper-weary customers Pokémon Go: Tips for the Gen 2 update European parliament calls for robot law, rejects robot tax Facebook says Irish challenge to US data transfers ‘deeply flawed’ Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: Tips for the Gen 2 update The smartwatch is dead; long live the smart watch European parliament calls for robot law, rejects robot tax Facebook CEO warns against reversal of global thinking Facebook says Irish challenge to US data transfers ‘deeply flawed’ Apple vowed to revolutionise TV – why hasn’t it?

By: Reuters | Updated: February 17, 2017 11:42 am Investors have been poring over the filing for Snap’s upcoming IPO to assess whether the still-unprofitable company will be the next Facebook Inc. ( Image for representation, Source: Snapchat) Snap Inc, owner of the popular messaging app Snapchat, set a lower-than-expected valuation range on Thursday, amid mounting investor concern over its unproven business model, slowing growth and tight founder control. The company, which filed for an initial public offering earlier this month, was widely expected to be valued at between $20 billion and $25 billion. However it said on Thursday it was targeting a valuation between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion, ahead of an investor roadshow due to start on Monday in London. Watch all our videos from Express Technology The lower valuation range reflected initial investor feedback. Snap wants to ensure there is sufficient demand for shares of the company that it trades up on its first day in public market. Investors have been poring over the filing for Snap’s upcoming IPO to assess whether the still-unprofitable company will be the next Facebook Inc, which has figured out how to make money from its social media platform, or if it will be more like Twitter Inc, which is struggling to achieve the same goal. With platform-hopping millennials as its prime customer base, and constantly evolving competition, the fact that Snapchat’s new user growth has already begun to slow concerns investors, sources said, asking not to be named because the deliberations are confidential. New active user growth was mostly flat in the early part of the last quarter in 2016, according to the IPO filing. Facebook’s Instagram, which had 600 million users as of late 2016, has introduced its own form of disappearing video content. On average, Snapchat has 158 million daily users. Also Read: Snap values itself at up to $22 billion ahead of IPO “Snap is already demonstrating decelerating growth before they have managed to break even,” said Yann Magnan, managing director at Duff & Phelps. Unlike social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, Snapchat can be harder for new users to understand and easier for non-users to avoid, some investors said. “With Facebook you almost feel left out, socially, if you’re not on it. You may miss a picture or invitations. I don’t get the sense people feel they’re missing out if they’re not on it,” said Chris Carter, portfolio manager for the Buffalo Growth Fund who has not yet made a decision on whether to buy Snap shares. Still, Snap proponents argue a more limited user base lends it more loyalty and opportunity for the company to make money. Snap, which is going public at a much earlier stage in its development than Twitter or Facebook, saw its loss widen to $514.64 million in 2016 from $372.89 million a year earlier. While not rare for a young company to be unprofitable, it is less common for an unprofitable company only five years old to ask for as whopping a valuation as Snap is aiming for. Snap generates most of its revenue from advertising and will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. ( Image for representation, source: Reuters) With Snap’s estimated valuation expected to be around 49 times revenue, and Facebook’s being 27 times, the IPO aspirations “stress how much Snap’s post-IPO growth must exceed Facebook’s to compensate for its lack of short-term profitability” said Magnan at Duff & Phelps. Snap generates most of its revenue from advertising and will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Investors have also raised concerns over Snap’s first of its kind three-share class structure, which gives no voting rights to IPO investors. Snap’s co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy will have the right of ten votes for every share, and existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares. “Evan is going to have to earn Wall Street’s trust. If he does that, the ownership issue goes away,” said Nabil Elsheshai, senior research analyst for Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis. ROADSHOW The company’s marketing roadshow will take place in London, New York, Boston and San Francisco. Snap is expecting to price its IPO after the U.S. market closes on March 1, according to a confidential document seen by Reuters. Snap said in a filing on Thursday it expected to raise as much as $3.2 billion from the offering of 200 million Class A shares. The offering is expected to be priced between $14 and $16 per share. Even at the low end of that expected valuation range, Snap would be the largest tech offering since Alibaba’s IPO in 2014, and after last year’s paucity of tech listings, its public launch will be closely watched. Snap said in a filing on Thursday it expected to raise as much as $3.2 billion from the offering of 200 million Class A shares. ( Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Selling shareholders, who include Spiegel, Murphy and former Sony CEO Michael Lynton, will sell 55 million shares in total. If the IPO prices on the higher end of the current range, Spiegel and Murphy would both make $256 million on the IPO and Lynton would make $878,000. Early Snap investors venture firm Benchmark Capital Partners would reap $171 million from the offering if it prices at the top of the range. Snap will have about 1.16 billion shares outstanding after the offering and list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SNAP.

Snap, which launched in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. Morgan Stanley & Co LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Barclays Capital Inc and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC are among the underwriters to the IPO.

BREAKING: Health Ranger threatened by left-wing media goons: “Destroy Alex Jones or we will destroy YOU” Thursday, February 16, 2017 by: Mike Adams Tags: Alex Jones, Donald Trump, Health Ranger, InfoWars, intimidation, Media Matters, threats (Natural News) FULL DISCLOSURE: I am being threatened with the “complete destruction” of my reputation, my brand and my character by left-wing media operatives who have issued a new threat this week: “Destroy Alex Jones or we will destroy YOU.” Alex Jones, of course, is the founder of InfoWars.com, one of the most popular multi-media publishers of pro-America news, videos and radio broadcasts in the world. The warning implies that a barrage of left-wing media stories will target me personally — obviously spreading “fake news” lies — unless I agree to go public with “opposition research” targeting Jones that was previously delivered to me on a physical thumb drive. I destroyed the thumb drive and refused to kow-tow to the insane, criminal agenda of destruction and lies now being pursued daily by the unhinged, delusional left-wing media (and its puppet masters such as George Soros). I have no doubt I am being targeted with this threat because I previously served as a substitute host for the Alex Jones Show, from 2011 – 2013. After I left the show in 2013, I was contacted by another left-wing media source that offered to pay me $50,000 to “expose” Alex Jones. I refused. Later, someone with access to some very advanced technology was able to engage me in a phone text conversation where they impersonated Alex Jones’ cell phone number, but I quickly realized it was a ruse and cut off communication. In various ways, I have been hounded since 2013 by left-wing criminals who are attempting to exploit my contact with Alex Jones to discredit his entire organization and silence him forever. Time and time again, I have refused to take part in their nefarious plots. I flat-out refuse to be manipulated through false fear and intimidation tactics deployed by manipulative “media spooks” who are obviously very well funded but incredibly misinformed. I do not consider myself to be a “competitor” of InfoWars. I consider myself to be a defender of liberty, truth and healthy living. I am on “team humanity” to defend humanity against the sinister agendas of the vaccine industry, the biotech industry and the sick-minded depopulation agenda of the most dangerous globalists of all. Anyone who is on “team humanity” is my ally, not my enemy. Malicious effort now under way to take out prominent Trump supporters and silence their support of our President Now, it seems, the stakes are even higher because of the victory of President Trump, a true patriot and determined warrior who is waging an epic battle against globalist forces, the “fake news” media and the corrupt elements of the so-called “deep state.” As the publisher of Trump.news, a pro-Trump REAL news website, I am being targeted as part of a left-wing media effort to discredit and destroy all Trump supporters who are prominent media innovators or personalities. The following document, entitled Democracy Matters, Strategic Plan for Action, reveals the sinister tactics of the left-wing media to discredit and destroy any people who support Donald Trump’s vision for America. The document states: (bold added) In the next four years, Media Matters will continues its core mission of disarming right-wing misinformation, while leading the fight against the next generation of conservative disinformation: The proliferation of fake news and propaganda now threatening the country’s information ecosystem. Here’s what success will look like: * Serial misinformers and right-wing propagandists inhabiting everything from social media to the highest levels of government will be exposed, discredited. * Internet and social media platforms, like Google and Facebook, will no longer uncritically and without consequence host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists. * Toxic alt-right social media-fueled harassment campaigns that silence dissent and poison our national discourse will be punished and halted. … Shareblue will take back social media for Democrats. We will delegitimize Donald Trump’s presidency by emboldening the opposition… * Trump allies will be forced to step down or change course due to news pushed by Shareblue. Media Matters will… “weaponize our research products to understand and take action against the changing media ecosystem and the extremists seeking to manipulate it…. Key alt-right figures will lose credibility and influence in response to our research and pressure.” A $13.4 million budget will allow Media Matters to “create a 34-person research department” [to destroy the opposition]. Intimidate Trump supporters into silence (or get them to turn on each other) It’s obvious from this document that a whole new effort of malicious intimidation and threats is being deployed against prominent Trump supporters who have achieved any substantial level of new media success. The goal is clear: To intimidate Trump supporters into silence, or — even better for the left-wing media — get pro-Trump publishers and journalists to turn on each other and destroy each other from within. I’ve already seen recent examples of insider attacks being leveled against Alex Jones and InfoWars. I have no doubt the very same cookie cutter-style attacks will also be recycled to target Natural News and the Health Ranger. It all stems from a blueprint plan that’s designed to demoralize Donald Trump supporters, then demonize and destroy them. It’s right out of the same playbook the radical left-wing media invoked in an attempt to destroy Trump from day one (an effort which spectacularly failed, by the way). In fact, that’s the bigger point in all this. Every person attacked by the left-wing media just gets more popular in the same way Trump became ever more popular as the media smeared him. Look at the case of Milo Yiannoupoulos from Breitbart: The malicious media attacks on his character — falsely labeling him part of the “alt-right” movement — resulted in him being offered a $250,000 advance on a book deal that has already seen his book reach the #1 ranking on Amazon even before its launch! Alex Jones, too, rode a wave of hit pieces and defamation against his character to become a powerful voice that now reaches more people than CNN! Every effort to destroy Alex, Milo, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Matt Drudge or Steve Bannon have only backfired on the insane left-wing media. It is precisely because of their malicious attacks and deceptions that Donald Trump won the election. The public was tired of the lies, and the backlash was truly historic. We must stand with Trump, or we’ll lose America forever But the battle has only just begun. As I’ve repeatedly warned in my Health Ranger Report podcasts, we must now stand with Trump and defeat the insane criminal forces that seek to destroy this nation and silence reason. The radical, unhinged Left is now the single greatest threat to the future of our nation, and they will use ANY means to silence or destroy their political opponents, including violating the law, committing acts of extreme violence, publishing malicious falsehoods, citing fictitious “sources” in their stories, misrepresenting their words with dishonest editing, etc. So I’m going to be crystal clear in my message to these criminal left-wing bullies and intimidation operatives: COME AND TAKE IT. You want to silence me? Bring a team and prepare to take casualties. Unless you somehow manage to put a bullet in my brain, there is no possibility whatsoever that I’m going to carry out your nefarious agenda and join your sick, demented cabal of insane f#cktardery. You might be able to pull it off if you bring a big enough force, but it’s going to cost you. I’m not going to lay down to your fake intimidation tactics… especially not when we have already won! We are the new media. We are rightfully trusted by the public because we’ve earned that trust by honestly reporting the real news. We are where people go for authentic news instead of the fake news you’ve been peddling for decades. I publish over 100 websites, and readership keeps rising by the day because we are taking your readers away from your lame “fake news” websites like the Washington Post and New York Times. People are turning off your lies and turning on the truth at Natural News, NewsTarget, Trump.news and other websites we run to protect liberty, defend the Republic and expose the destructive anti-human agendas of the political Left and the globalists that run them all. Listen to my full podcast to hear a more detailed explanation of these threats and why I refuse to take part in their sinister agenda.     Previous :CHALLENGE: $100,000 to the first person who can find a scientific study proving Thimerosal (mercury) is safe to inject into children Next : Health Ranger issues “drink mercury” challenge to toxic vaccine pushers who poison infants for profit Join the Health Ranger's FREE email newsletter Get breaking news alerts on GMOs, fluoride, superfoods, natural cures and more...

She spent most of 2016 making him the top priority in her life before he died last month. Courtesy photo By Dennis McCarthy, LA Daily News Posted: 02/16/17, 8:35 PM PST | Updated: 3 hrs ago # Comments She was Grandpa’s little girl, the inquisitive one who would sit with him for hours in the backyard listening to his old war stories and never tire of hearing them again and again. “Enough stories,” Felipe Lopez would finally say. “What do you want to do now, niña?” Erica Hanson, all of 7 years old, would run into the garage and grab their fishing poles. Half an hour later, they’d be sitting in folding chairs casting a line into Lake Balboa waiting for the fish to bite, which they seldom did. That was OK; it gave them a chance to talk some more. Nobody knew Grandpa like she did, so when he told her last May this would probably be his last Memorial Day parade, her antenna went up. Her grandpa, 92 now, was trying to tell her their time together was growing short. He could feel it. “He had been dropping hints before that, but now I began to worry these might be my last moments with him,” she said. “I felt a sudden panic knowing this could really be it.” But what could she do? She was 32 years old and living in Singapore now as a program manager for Google in the Indonesia market. She had bought him a computer and taught him to Skype so they could talk face to face every week. She had made as much time as she could for him when she was back in the States on work assignments and vacations, but that just didn’t seem to be enough. Not for all he had meant to her. So, Grandpa’s little girl did the only thing she could do for this man she adored. She made him the focus of her life in 2016. She came home more often to sit in the backyard of the Reseda home he had lived in since 1951, but this time she brought a friend who would film him talking about his life, especially the war years. She turned down invitations from friends so she could spend more time taking him on day trips — back to the church where he married her late grandmother and to their first tiny home. She bought him boxes of Cream of Wheat when he mentioned he hadn’t had any since her grandmother died. Funny how a taste can bring back so many fond memories, he would tell her. She never looked at the clock when she was with him. There was no rush. He was her priority. She took him to Washington, D.C., to meet the daughters of his best friend in World War II, Nick Orsena, who had died in 2003. Advertisement “His daughters were so appreciative,” Hanson said. “He was telling them stories about their father they had never heard before. Grandpa was so happy that day. He just glowed. “I know he was proud of me. He told everyone at his American Legion Post in Reseda that I worked for Google, but he called it Googles. He told them I went to Stanford and played rugby. “Yes, he was proud of me, but I was even prouder of him.” Their next trip together was going to be to Texas to see his brother, Eliseo Lopez, 91, one of five Lopez brothers who served this country in World War II. They never got the chance. Her grandpa was right. The end was near. He died last month, just shy of his 93rd birthday. Eliseo followed him just 10 days later. “We heard that he was heartbroken when his older brother died, and he suddenly changed,” Hanson said. “He felt it was OK to pass.” When she returned to work after her grandpa’s funeral, she told her friends at Google that the one thing she regretted was not having the chance to bring the two brothers together one last time. “They all said I had done more for my grandfather than any of them had ever done for theirs. None of them had even given a thought to sitting down with their grandparents and filming them as they talked about their lives. “And all I can think of now is, why? Are we just too busy to spare the time? Are we so focused on the future that we don’t have time for the past?” Not her. She has a demanding, challenging job with a company that is all about the future, but she’s grounded in the past. “In honor of my grandpa, I’ve begun collecting more stories of veterans and started a Facebook community called ‘Stories from WW2 Veterans’ to share these stories.” 2016 was for her grandfather. 2017 is for his buddies.

Downtown Westport on a recent afternoon. Photo: Associated Press Woog’s World: There is only one Woog’s World 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The recent kerfuffle over TEAM Westport’s essay contest on white privilege focused national attention on our town. Nearly every news report noted Westport is 93 percent white. Some residents thought that figure sounded high. Others believed it was low. In fact, according to 2010 census data, our “white alone” population is 84.5 percent. The next most populous group is “Asian alone,” at 5.8 percent. Then comes Hispanic (4.5 percent), “two or more races” (2.0), “black alone” (0.8), “other race alone” (0.02) and “American Indian alone” (0.03). So yeah, we are pretty white. But we’re other things, too. A ramble through the demographic landscape of Google yields some very intriguing statistics. I’ll share some of them here, with only a few editorial comments. We’re 51.9 percent female, and 48.1 percent male. Our median age is 45.4 years, making us nearly four years older than the statewide average. More Westporters claim Italian ancestry (13.7 percent) than anything else. That’s followed by “American” (9.6 percent), which actually makes this entire category invalid. With only 0.03 percent of our population calling themselves “American Indian alone,” I’m not exactly sure what “American” means. We are 9.2 percent Irish, 5.5 percent Russian, 5.3 percent English and 3.8 percent Eastern European. Our foreign-born population is more than 7 percent. Those Westporters were born primarily in Europe (4.8 percent), Asia (2.0) and Latin America (1.4). Westport’s estimated median household income in 2015 was $167,872. Connecticut’s median household income was $71,346. Of course, ours is one of the wealthiest states in the country. We are definitely up in one percent-ville. On the other hand, the percentage of Westporters living in poverty in 2015 was 4.7. The estimated per capita income in 2015 was $97,331. That’s an astonishing figure. I don’t know too many kindergartners (or even high school students) earning that much. So, their parents are pulling in some serious bucks. It should be noted the average household size is 2.7 people. That may come as a surprise to those who think Westport is a town filled only with families with kids. As for same-sex couples: 0.4 percent of all households are headed by two men, another 0.4 percent by two women. For those of us who are at least 25 years old, 98.9 percent have a high school degree or higher. The figure for at least a bachelor’s degree is 76.6 percent. An astonishing 39.0 percent have a graduate or professional degree. There is no indication how many of us attended Trump University. On weekdays, our population increases by 7,346, a change of 26.6 percent. That means many more people commute into Westport for work than commute out. This can be verified by the amount of inbound traffic around 9 a.m. every day, and outbound around 5. Or you could just walk into Starbucks and count the number of people working on Macbooks. Our most common occupations in 2015 were management (27 percent), sales-related (18), business and financial occupations (13), legal (7), office and administrative support, health-related (4), and arts, design, entertainment, sports and media (4). That sounds way off to me. Almost everyone I know here is a lawyer, runs a hedge fund, or works for ESPN. Meanwhile, the most common industries in Westport — which I think means jobs that are based here — are finance and insurance (29 percent), professional, scientific and technical services (19), retail trade (8), health care and assistance (7), wholesale trade (4), construction (4) and manufacturing (4). I am surprised there is not a separate category for nail salons and frozen yogurt shops. Nationally, among places with a population of at least 5,000, we are number 52 on the list of cities with the highest percentage of workers working at home. Fortunately, our “historical tornado activity” is slightly below the Connecticut state average, and 41 percent smaller than the overall U.S. average. Our earthquake disaster, while near the state average, is a whopping 88 percent smaller than the national average. Fun fact: Did you know there have been 13 presidential declarations of disasters in Fairfield County? We are generally healthier than the state as a whole. Our average BMI of 28.1 compares favorably with the state average of 28.7. On the other hand, 35.4 percent of us are overweight. While 21.2 percent of all Connecticut residents report “feeling badly” about themselves, in Westport that number is 18.7 percent. The percentage of people — presumably adults — who do not drink alcohol at all is 8.5. We sleep an average of seven hours a night. That’s a lot of stuff. Some of it makes sense; some seems senseless. But here’s one statistic that no one can argue with: Number of “Woog’s Worlds” in Westport. There is only one. Dan Woog is a Westport writer, and his “Woog's World” appears each Friday.

It's time for the next installment in our monthly series of articles looking at the developers and publishers behind some of our favorite games. The aim here is for you readers to get a sense of the person, so the tone is more conversational than we usually use in interviews here at TouchArcade. it's also not necessarily about the games themselves, either. Basically, we'll kick off and see where the conversation takes us. This month, we're speaking to Jonathan Schneider of Aggro Magnet Games, the developer behind Vigil RPG [$0.99], an excellent game from 2014 that flew under the radar of many players. For this transcript, my words will be bolded, while Jon's will be in regular text. And now, let's get to the interview.   Introductions and Pizza Talk For any of our readers who may or may not know who you are, who are you, what are you about, and what are your favorite pizza toppings? Hey everybody, this is Jon Schneider, I am a professional developer, although not a professional game developer. As we'll get into, Vigil RPG, which is my one published iOS game, was totally a side/evening project that I was just doing in my free time. I'm a dad, I've got three kids, so that keeps me plenty busy. My favorite pizza toppings are pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom. Preferably a deep dish! Oh, deep dish. Now that's one that I haven't heard from anyone yet. I'm glad you're specifying the crust, because I feel too many people gloss over it. Oh yes, if I can get the super deep stuff... well, I live three hours outside of Chicago, in Western Michigan, and those Chicago-style deep dishes, when I can get my hands on them, that's my favorite stuff. The authentic ones. Excellent.   On Backgrounds and Inspirations So yeah, you put out Vigil, which was, I want to say, an underground game? But one that I enjoyed very much. You mentioned that you are a developer, but not a game developer as your day job. What kind of development do you do? What kind of stuff do you make? Sure. I'm basically what the "cool kids" might call today a full-stack developer. I do web applications, so I've got my hands in all pieces of that, from doing the front-end to the middle-tier business layer. I'm also maintaining the database, and writing for that. So kind of the whole thing, from front to back. I've been doing it for a while really. I was very fortunate to grow up with two parents in the computer industry in the early days. My dad actually worked for IBM, so we had an IBM PC in the house from almost as early as they were available. I had that to play around with as a little kid. Wow. And my mom worked in software as well, so I had a nice early start in learning. I taught myself to program in BASIC at home, at about six years of age, and I've been programming off and on ever since. How did you go from that kind of work to deciding to make a game? So I've done a number of programming projects on the side. This is the first game, but I've made a Windows Media Player skin which was open-sourced, I made an application for holiday and birthday gift-giving that my family uses internally... a number of things. Really, if anyone is interested they can hunt down my blog and I mention it a lot on there. Um, a common thing these days is when I've had the idea to write something, like a browser extension or some little tool that I feel like I need, I think that I could totally write that. But then I'll think that I should probably see if someone has done it already, so I hit Google and search and, almost invariably, whatever idea I had, whatever I wanted, was out there already. So I just download what the other person made and get on with my day. It's great. Yeah. In this case, though, I kind of had a hankering for a particular kind of game on a mobile platform, on the iPhone because that's what I had in my pocket, that didn't seem to exist. That was really surprising given the plethora, even back in 2013 when I first had this idea in my head, of RPGs that were available on the App Store. There just wasn't one that I wanted. I had a checklist of things I was looking for. I wanted a turn-based, classic-style role-playing game, in the style of the original Dragon Warrior on the good old NES. That was my favorite role-playing game back as a kid, one of my early favorites. I can tell! (laughing) A lot of its influence obviously made its way into Vigil RPG. But just basically looking for a game with that turn-based gameplay and a single hero, so that you're not trying to keep track of a whole party. Single, one-on-one battles. But then also the other major inspiration was, interestingly and oddly enough, the original Paper Mario that came out late in the life-cycle on the Nintendo 64. Hunh. And in that game, well, you might write it off as kind of a fluff RPG, like "oh look, someone put Mario in an RPG, ha ha, that's really funny, there's probably not that much depth to it", but actually, it's my favorite combat system in any game that I've played. Because you could play it in such a smart way. Enemy hit points were visible, or at least you could pretty trivially make them become visible with an ability that you got right off the bat early in the game. And then every attack you had did damage not in the hundreds or thousands like your typical Final Fantasy game, but in the single digits. So if an enemy had five health, for example, you could go "well, I can do a normal attack for two, then spend a little of my flower points to hit them with a special for three" and really efficiently take them out using only one flower point. And you could extrapolate that. Paper Mario did feature multiple enemies at a time in battles, but it gave you that ability to really carefully and thoughtfully, again in a turn-based game with all the time you need to think about it, think through exactly how you could really efficiently beat this group of enemies and preserve your resources like your health points and your flower points. Right. So I kind of wanted to marry those two concepts. That really interesting gameplay in Paper Mario, that battle system, with an old school role-playing game like the old Dragon Warrior. I just couldn't find that on the App Store, so I was like, "you know what? I bet I could write this myself". That's what got me started. That's interesting. I mean, obviously I picked up on the Dragon Quest vibe, but I didn't really notice the Paper Mario thing until you mentioned it, and that is... well, I can see it now.    On Developing Vigil So was it difficult to make the game? Did you do everything by yourself? Is this a one-man show? I'll reveal a little secret. It was a total solo project, as far as I was the only developer on the project. I didn't contract out any art or music or anything like that. It turns out... this is like a tip for aspiring or first-time game developers who don't mind making a low-budget looking game as Vigil RPG certainly is, as you rightfully commented in your review back in 2014. Anyway, there are some sites which will provide you with art, music, and sound assets that are licensed for use in games, even commercial games like Vigil RPG is. Typically, with a Creative Commons license, which means as long as you give the creators credit, then you can go ahead and use that stuff in your game. I think one of the sites that I hit was Open Game Art, and there was just a number of pixel-art enemies in particular. For whatever talents I  may have as a programmer, I'm just not an artist. I think I did art for one enemy in the game, the fire elemental, and even that was just a real picture of a flame that I scaled down and pixelated. Okay. Open Game Art was one, and there are a number of others. Right from the title screen of Vigil RPG, there's a credits button you can hit so that you don't have to wait until you finish the game or anything like that. If you just scroll through that, you'll see the names of all the artists and musicians who, very generously, contributed these assets and just put them out there to use on an attribution basis. That was what really let me get the project off the ground, because if I had to try to draw the enemies myself, it just would have been really bad. Really awful. I mean, you can succeed doing that kind of thing. I don't know if you've played Dream Quest, which is a game with a really interesting battle system but really crudely hand-drawn art. I think it manages to succeed in spite of the art, but I wanted to make the game look at least half-way nice. And of course, that 8-bit aesthetic, which is reasonably popular these days, is a way that I could pull it off, or to make at least a half-way polished-looking game without having it look awful in the process. It's interesting that you mention Dream Quest, because that's actually going to be next week's Reload article. Oh, no way! Interesting. I'll have to check out that article. Yeah. The whole programmer art phenomenon. (laughs) But you know, it's interesting because some developers have kind of made that their aesthetic. I think of, like, Michael Brough, who made 868-HACK and Imbroglio. You know, that is definitely "programmer art", but somehow it has become so distinctive to him that he's made it work. Well, anyway. So how long did it take you start to finish on Vigil? It took about eighteen months. That sounds longer than it really is. On the calendar, it was eighteen months, but it was really.... well, like I said, I have a day job, three kids, and a wife who I try to pay a lot of attention to and, you know, be a good dad and husband. So it was really me fitting it into my free time, which is roughly speaking between the hours of 10 PM and midnight. I would try to work two, three, four, sometimes five nights a week on it. I haven't done the multiplication recently to figure out what that adds up to in terms of raw hours, but it was kind of just fitting in a couple of hours here and there whenever I could spare them, and when I wasn't in the mood to, like, play other games. Did the final game end up matching what your concept was in the beginning? Was there anything you couldn't do that you wanted to do? Any things that you are particularly happy about in the final product? I know that's a lot of questions, but go for it. Yeah, so those are good questions. Um, there definitely are some things I had in mind that didn't make it into the final game, like the way I started was to first open up some plain old text documents and start sketching out ideas. Like, what do I want the hero and her abilities to be like? What do I want the magic system to be like? What do I want the enemies to do? What do I want to do for a world map and for dungeons? What does the overall plot look like? And from there, I just went ahead and started implementing things. Let's just kill something and see if it even works. See if I could even do it, technically, because this was my first... well, I'm actually a Windows guy, even though I carry an iPhone. I guess you could say I'm in both the Apple and the Microsoft worlds. Right. So this was my first project where I had to buy a cheap old Mac Mini off of eBay. Because I didn't know if this was going to come to fruition, or if I was just going to go at it for a couple of weeks and realize that this wasn't going to work and give up. I actually went ahead and invested, I think it was $450 to get a used, slow, old 2009 Mac Mini on eBay. It's actually just sitting here on my desk right now, alongside my much nicer, more powerful Windows laptop that I have for work. I built Vigil on that. So the first thing I implemented, I think, was the combat screen, putting buttons on there so the hero could attack, displayed the enemy's picture and stats, how much damage the enemy would do, and of course the box in the middle where the combat text was displayed. Go on. That was one thing from Dragon Warrior that I really wanted, to have the combat results in text so that it could be quick. Everything in Vigil RPG is controlled by one tap, you just have the single hero that you have to worry about, and you've got up to six action buttons in front of you, so that you just tap one of those to use it. One tap and the round plays out, and then you can see the enemy's actions happen, you see your actions happen, and it's just text with maybe a little graphical animation. So after around one second, the round has played out, you see what happened, and you can go on to the next round. Once you know what you're doing, you can move through combat really quickly so that it never feels like a grind. Yeah, it's nice and fast. Now, to answer your question about what didn't make it. There were a number of ideas that I learned as I was doing this incremental process of building the combat screen, then building the world map, then building the town, and so on. Every time I built something, I would play with it for a little while and test it, see what worked and what didn't seem to work. For combat, for example, I originally had the idea of making it a classic RPG in the sense of having a dodge chance on some of the enemies, where your attack would just randomly miss. Or a critical chance, where you would randomly do extra damage to the enemy or they would do extra damage to you. After play-testing, I just got rid of it. It didn't seem to be necessary to have those systems in the game to add to the fun. It just added randomness. Vigil RPG is, ideally, so tightly-tuned that once you know what an enemy does and know how to counter its moves, you can defeat the enemy with very minimal expenditure of your resources. If enemy randomly dodges you sometimes, then suddenly whacks you an extra time for no reason, you're just out a bunch of hit points. And it's not your fault. So I've recently noticed a bunch of games going with that model, which I think is interesting. Like, for example, Fire Emblem Heroes, which Nintendo just released a week or two ago as we're recording this, uses that same mechanic. Whereas the mainline games have that randomness, that chance of critical hits and misses. The new one I think is trying to reduce complexity, reduce randomness where it doesn't need to be, and make it more of a pure strategy game. Where what you're doing determines whether you succeed or fail, not a dice roll. So that ended up working well. I took the dodge percent out, I took critical hits out, and the game was more predictable and more fun. Interesting. Another thing, which I think might be unique to Vigil RPG, is that when you flee from a battle, it pushes you closer to town. On the world map and dungeons, you're not moving around with a d-pad. That was something I did not want to have on iOS, I didn't want to carry over the d-pad concept just because in every console game ever you move with a d-pad. In Vigil RPG, there are just locations on the map and dungeons where you can touch to move and your character goes there. You don't have to fiddle around, worrying about if your finger is off center on the d-pad, making your character move where you don't want them to move. You move by touch, and when you flee a battle, your character moves one space closer to town. In this game, you're trying to do everything with as few moves as possible, and you get better rewards if you make fewer moves, because you're playing more efficiently. Yes, it's kind of a characteristic of the game. When I was play-testing, I realized that in my original system, where when you ran from battle the character just remained in place, you could just go on to the next square. So you could just reach a place far away on the world map, like a boss for example, by fleeing from every single battle. You could enter into battle, flee on the first turn, lose little or no health from it, and move to the next square on the map. Do that again and again until you reach the boss, and you'd end up with a 90% full tank of hit points and be able to take the boss down easily. Which kind of defeats the game's mechanic of trying to efficiently play your way to the boss, and actually fight your way through battles without losing too much health so that you would be in better shape to defeat the boss. That's interesting, you pre-emptively cut off that exploit. That's good thinking! Yeah, there were a couple of things like that, that's just one example. A couple of other things... originally I had it so you could just scroll, touch the screen and drag it to scroll the world map around, but it added complexity and I had to worry about what would happen if you scrolled the map way away from where your hero is, and had to put a way to re-center it so that you don't get lost, and if there should be a fog of war clouding the parts of the map that you hadn't revealed yet because you haven't made it over there yet, and so on. So I thought, why don't we just always keep the hero centered on the world map, and what you can see on the world map is what is on your phone's screen, like a small distance away from your hero and that's it. It didn't take away anything from the fun, so I went with that. I was going to ask you about how the combat seems to be focused around learning what the enemy tells are. I was going to ask about that, but now I can see how that kind of ties into your philosophy of reducing randomness, so... Yeah, reducing randomness, and the Paper Mario inspiration. Like you could jump on a Koopa or hit it with your hammer, and if you did that, it exposed its soft underside, taking away all of its armor, and you could defeat it easily. In the same way in Vigil RPG, a lot of enemies will give you clues, more obvious with the early enemies in the game, to kind of get you used to the system. They get more subtle later on. I think the first goblin you meet, just a couple of squares away from town, will pop text that says something like "The Goblin moves forward threateningly", but he doesn't actually attack you that turn. So the idea is that you should defend with your shield, because if you don't, he clobbers you with his big special attack, doing lots of damage. Whereas if you defend, it doesn't do much damage at all, and you can go on to defeat him without losing much health. Alright. You've almost hit on every little point I was going to ask about. That was a very good explanation, very thorough.   On Vigil's Reception So I guess what I'll ask about now is, how was your feeling about the game's reception? You know, in terms of maybe from the players, from critics, and of course sales. Were you satisfied by it, were you surprised, or disappointed, or...? I was pleased. I mean, it was not a commercial success, but that was never the objective. I made a conscious design decision way back in the beginning, when I was sketching everything out in documents and deciding what I wanted the game to be. Even back in 2013, there was certainly the trend of all the big commercial successes using a freemium model, where you download the game and play for free, and the game tries to get you to make in-app purchases to cover the developer's costs and make them some money. Players can try the game for free and see if they like it before they throw some money at it, which is great. Alright, yeah. But in my case, I wanted to go for the classic "pay up front and get it all" model, and the reason for that is that when I think about those free-to-play games, they're kind of trying to serve two masters, or chase two goals. Number one is that they're trying to make a fun game, obviously, but number two is that they're trying to get the player to spend some money. Those two goals can be in conflict with each other. There's nothing especially fun about having a stamina meter in your game, or having a premium currency that's really hard to get your hands on. I guess it can be kind of fun to have that gacha-style random hero draw like in the new Fire Emblem game. It can be, sure. I guess I just didn't want to have to try to serve the two masters, and just wanted to focus on making a fun game. You know, I didn't want to make a fun game, and then try to take some of the fun away so that the player can get the fun back. I just didn't want to go there. I'm fortunate enough to have a day job so that I can feed my family and live in a reasonable home, so I decided, you know what? I'm just going to put a reasonable price tag on it, like $2.99. You do that, you unlock the game, and you get the whole nine yards, and I can focus on making the game fun. Vigil RPG has got none of the trappings of those free-to-play RPGs. No stamina meters, no in-app purchases... it doesn't even nag you for reviews, ever, because if it's not fun, it's not going in the game. And that was kind of the guiding philosophy. Okay. So you mentioned it was not a financial success, but in terms of feedback from people, were you happy with what you heard? I was, because to date the game hasn't gotten a whole lot of attention, but what feedback there has been, has been almost universally positive. I think the game has yet to get a rating on the App Store that is not a five-star rating. Though there are only 15-20 reviews lifetime for the game, so that's not saying much at all. But I was super-surprised and pleased to see your review, Shaun, of Vigil RPG when you did that back in November of 2014. Because, I'm totally not trying to flatter you or anything, but it was just spot-on and nailed what I was trying to do with the game. Just about everyone who has played the game has liked it. Some of the other forum communities I hang around in, as well as the TouchArcade community, has had lots of good things to say about the game. So even though the game only ended up selling a few hundred copies, and it's only kind of just broken even, that's fine. I'm just happy that those who have stumbled across the game and tried it seemed to have liked it.   On Future Plans I guess my next question is, are you working on another game? That's a great question, and I was wondering if you would ask. Um, I'm not. As I mentioned, my time is really limited, so I like to try to spend it with my family first, and then those couple of hours to myself is when I play my games. I've got a number of things I'm playing right now, so I'm not actually working on a new game. What I do have part of the way done is an update to Vigil RPG itself to make it free, just so that more people can try it. Then there will be a one-time in-app purchase to unlock the rest, kind of like the model you would see a lot early in the App Store's days. Right. I'm going to, if I can get it to work well, try to flip Vigil over to that model, and... well, it's not a money-making venture, really. I just think a lot of people would find the game fun and think it was cool, especially people who love old-school, NES-era role-playing games, or the Paper Mario combat system. If that sounds fun to them, a lot of people could get their hands on it for free. I plan on having a fairly generous portion of the game before that unlock point. I'm thinking of having it be a $2.99 unlock, kind of like how it was when I first released it. So if you want it for cheap, get Vigil RPG now. It's $0.99 or your local equivalent, as cheap as Apple will allow me to price it without giving it away for free. If all goes well, in perhaps three or four months, you'll see that big update that will make the game free. If you pick it up after that and want to see the rest of the game, you'll have to pay the $2.99, buy me a coffee. So people who bought the game will already be covered, right? Absolutely. As you'd expect, if you paid, you'll get the full version unlock right off the bat. You'll just a get a big thumbs-up when you reach the place where you'd have to unlock. Okay, just checking. It's the only right thing to do, I don't want to make people pay twice. On Inspirations Past and Present So what kind of games do you like to play? Um, one thing I've liked recently is Stardew Valley on PC, it's fantastic. I had bounced off of a couple of the older Harvest Moon games. I tried them but I didn't really like them. But Stardew Valley is a fantastic blend of relaxing farming and relationships with the townspeople. There's kind of an efficiency aspect to that one too. I hadn't realized this about myself or maybe why that's why I like the game so much, but there's definitely that in Stardew Valley. You have limited hours in the day, limited space on your farm, and so on. It's up to you whether you want to optimize and get your farm going as well as you can with those limited resources. You have a limited stamina meter, too. I actually played through that game twice. I mean, there's no real ending, but I played it until I had more money than I knew what to do with, the biggest house, a marriage, that sort of thing. So that's been a lot of fun. Anything else? On iOS, I think my favorite game this past year was Solitairica, which I think had a nice review on TouchArcade. Again, it pushes a lot of those buttons I like. Turn-based strategy game, plays in portrait orientation, a limited number of skills at any given time (similar to Vigil), and just a lot of interesting strategic and tactical decisions with really balanced combat. It's a lot of fun front to back. Then there's Fire Emblem Heroes, it's a riot. I've played, I think, every handheld US release of that series, and I'm enjoying a lot of the design decisions they made to fit that to the iOS platform. Then, in a completely different genre, there's DOOM for PC. I'm finally digging into that one. Oh, okay. Perhaps as a throwback to some of the old DOOM games I played on PCs when I was a kid. I've noticed as an older gamer now, I'm pushing 40 soon, it's hard for me to get into the AAA-type, full 3D graphics games where you run around in an open world. More so than it used to be for me. But I played DOOM enough that I stuck with it and the gameplay started to click. And it helps that the systems in that game are very similar to the old 1990s-era DOOM games. So I'm going through that game now and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. I got that game to exercise what is the first new home PC I've bought in eight years. So that's giving that a work-out, and it's enjoyable. Nice! I also managed to secure a pre-order for the new Switch, which is coming out in a few weeks. I'm looking forward to playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild on that hybrid console/handheld. Okay, well, time just flies on this thing, but I guess we're getting to the end of our allotted time here. If there's anything you want to say now, any message you want to put out there, go for it. Um, just want to give a shout-out to my wife Melissa, who I love and who was super-patient with me as I disappeared many nights during 2013 and 2014 to work on Vigil RPG and get it out the door. It was something I always dreamed of doing, developing my own game, and I finally made it happen. Apart from that, I just want to thank all those art, music, and sound creators who, very unselfishly, put their talents up on the internet for use with Creative Commons or even just free licenses. You can check out all of those folks in the Vigil RPG credits, and I'd encourage everyone to just take a quick look at that, find those folks, and check out their other stuff, because they do really good work. Finally, one final shout-out to the Gamers With Jobs community. An awesome bunch of folks, so any mature gamers who are looking for good discussion and like-minded folks to play with, that's a great place to hang out. Alright, well, thanks a lot for your time! Even though you're not making any new games right now, it's good to talk to people even if they just did a one-off like you did. And who knows what the future might hold, right Jon? Yeah, once again, if I have a hankering to make another game, you'll be among the very first to know. Great, thanks! And thanks for talking to us today! Thanks again to Jon for agreeing to this interview and filling us in on his past, present, and future. Thanks also to you, kind readers, for supporting this idea.

Expressing concern over the declining sex ratio, the apex court, however, assured the Indian arms of the multinational cyber giants that it would not initiate any contempt proceedings against them as the idea was to make them “responsive” to the local laws and concerns. A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and R Banumathi said in case of any doubt, the in-house expert bodies of these firms may communicate with the nodal agency appointed by the Centre for guidance and necessary action. Google India said it obeyed the court’s directions. “We have always been compliant and are supportive of removing paid content based on terms linked to gender selection tests. We have taken additional action to disable auto-complete predictions for relevant terms on our site and show a warning that tells users (that) pre-natal gender screening or testing is illegal in India,” the firm said in its statement. —PTI Share this Post: « Previous Article Centre’s poser to SC on triple talaq Next Article » Naliya gang rape: Cong seeks probe by HC judge Tagged with: centre Dipak Misra expert girl R Banumathi JUST ARRIVED Why did 11 Asha Kiran home inmates die, Delhi HC asks AAP govt Mahila Raj in Mumbai for BMC poll 2017 Despite fall, GDP will bounce back sharply: RBI Governor Pakistan-Afghanistan border crossing sealed at Torkham Pakistan: UN condemns deadly terror attack on Sufi shrine EDITOR’S PICK Korean dictator irks both US, China It is an anachronism of sorts that in today’s times there is a dictator like Kim Jong- un of North… New milestone in Indian satellite march The successful launch of a record-breaking 104 nano satellites into orbit by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), all on… A saga without an end in TN Law is made for powerful women to violate which is why Chinnamma (V.N.Sasikala) will never replace Amma (Jayalalithaa) as chief… Mind sustainability with Metro 3 THE government’s assurances that more trees will be planted is excessively cynical, since any amount of new plantation will take… Justice Karnan must be brought to justice The contempt notice served on a Calcutta High Court judge, Justice Karnan, by a seven-member bench of the Supreme Court… Home About Us Authors Careers Disclaimer Privacy Policy Contact Us Advertise with us Archive RSS © Copyright Indian National Press (Bombay) Private Limited 2017.

TECHNOLOGY Nonstop Innovation Is Why Snap Won't End Up Like Twitter The maker of Snapchat has shown a penchant for innovation since its founding in 2011. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The biggest problem with Twitter is that it's never had much innovation, an analyst once told me. "If you used Twitter the first day it existed and then slipped into a coma for eight years and woke up today, you'd recognize the platform. It looks very much the same," then-Forrester Research analyst Nate Elliott told me in early 2015. "While Facebook innovates every day and constantly offers users new ways to engage on the site, Twitter's basically the same exact thing it's always been." I'm reminded of this conversation -- which is just as apt today as it was two years ago -- as I read headlines from reporters and analysts who are quick to compare Snap Inc. to Twitter. The premise of the comparison is a recent slowing in Snapchat's user growth disclosed in the company's S-1 filing. To some minds, this deceleration is reminiscent of Twitter, which has demonstrated little ability to increase its user base since first going public in late 2013. That's where the comparison starts and stops, because weak user growth in and of itself isn't a problem. It just seems that way because it's often a symptom of the real problem: a tech company's inability to create innovative new features and products. That's a problem Snap doesn't have under CEO Evan Spiegel, who has proved time and again he is all about making things new. On that score, Twitter and Snap couldn't be more different. As Elliott pointed out two years ago, Twitter hasn't changed much since it first came into existence in 2006. To this day, Twitter is a service based on 140-character messages that you see in a reverse-chronological timeline. Certainly, Twitter has added little wrinkles here and there -- you can now watch NFL games live on the service, there's some algorithmic surfacing of tweets deemed relevant to your interests, and if you wish to avoid online harassment, you can mute whatever terms offend you. But by and large, Twitter is as it always has been, a place where you can send out micro-messages to the world. Twitter has been so afraid to reinvent itself that it is now practically on life support as a result. Snapchat, on the other hand, is a drastically different app than it was even just a few years ago, and as a company, it has completely changed. When Snapchat was first going mainstream in 2012 and 2013, it was largely known as "that sexting app." Its primary purpose was to send your friends photos and videos that you didn't want hanging around. You couldn't read a story about Snapchat without reading the word "ephemeral." Practically none of those characterizations can be used to describe Snapchat today Just look at one of the additions to Snapchat in the last year: Memories. This feature is the exact antithesis of what Snapchat was five years ago. Back then, you wanted your snaps to go away. Now, Snapchat makes it easy for you to share an old photo or video. This kind of innovation is no anomaly. Since 2012, Snapchat has changed the premise of its app over and over again. In 2013, it added Stories so you could broadcast your daily activities with all of your friends for 24 hours. In 2015, the app introduced Discover, giving its users a new way to access media. And last year, Snapchat rebranded itself as Snap when it introduced Spectacles, its first foray into hardware. It's not likely to be the last, with Spiegel now calling Snap a camera company, not a social media or messaging service. Time and again, Spiegel has spotted where user behavior is heading and placed Snap in a position to benefit from it. This is something Twitter has largely been unable to master. Even when Twitter has noticed an opportunity, it has always tripped after gaining a head start -- I'm talking about bite-size videos (see: Vine) and live streaming (see: Periscope). When Sony Pictures was hacked in 2014, some leaked emails involved Snapchat. It showed that the company had paid tens of millions of dollars in three acquisitions: one was Scan.me, a QR code scanning company, another was AddLive, a real-time video chat startup, and the third was Vergence Labs, which made technology similar to that of Google Glass. Scan.me and AddLive were turned into features for Snapchat, and Vergence Labs was clearly a predecessor for Spectacles. In this respect, Spiegel has shown he possesses vision and an ability to spot talent and pull the trigger on important acquisitions that merits comparisons to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Without a doubt, Snap has its challenges. It's concerning that such a young app could already be facing user-growth problems. It's troubling just how fiercely Facebook is attacking Snapchat, and it's alarming that Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy do not want to give shareholders any voting power whatsoever. Snap must overcome these issues, but as analysts and investors comb through the company's S-1 filing for nits, it's important to keep in mind what Spiegel and Snap have already shown when it comes to innovation.

Works very well on Chrome. Real-time collaboration supported. Cons Missing many features. Expensive paid accounts. Bottom Line Milanote is a new Web-based note-taking app that thinks of notebooks more like canvases than legal pads. It's designed for visual people but leaves out too many features to truly satisfy them, for now. By Jill Duffy Milanote is a new cloud-based note-taking app designed for people with a visual mindset. In many ways, it mimics note-taking apps that are specific to the iPad, such as Penultimate, adopting the model of an unlined canvas rather than A legal pad. But Milanote is not available on the iPad or any other touch-specific format at the moment. The only place to find it is in a web browser. It doesn't support drawing, sketching, or handwriting, and for that reason, is very limited—apart from its excellent real-time collaboration. //Compare Similar Products Compare Evernote (Web)   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Keep (Web)   %displayPrice%%seller% Zoho Notebook (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Simplenote (Web)   %displayPrice%%seller% Fetchnotes (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Penultimate (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Notability (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Notes Plus (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Price and Plans Milanote is free to use for as long as you want with one large limitation: You can only store up to 100 notes, images, or links. The app offers two paid subscription options that remove the upload limit. Milanote Professional (the version I tested) is the first paid tier, which costs $15 per month or $144 annually. The other tier is called Milanote Professional Team, and it's designed to give multiuser signups a discount. When two or more people sign up together, the price is $12.50 per person per month, or $120 per person per year. Other than that, the plans are the same. You get the same support channels, the same set of features, and the same maximum file upload size of 10MB. View All 7 Photos in Gallery Milanote prices are on the high side, compared with other similar services, especially given that it doesn't have nearly the same range of features as the top players in the space. Evernote, for example, is one of the most note-taking popular apps, and users complained loudly when the company upped its prices to $69.99 per year for a Business account and $34.99 per year for a Plus account. That's still much less than Milanote charges. Evernote also still has a free tier of service, but it limits you to syncing across only two devices, and you can only upload 60MB of data each month. There are a few other great features that free Evernote users don't get. See PCMag's review of Evernote for more details on what's included in the different plans. Microsoft OneNote is the other major name in the note-taking and syncing space. OneNote has a free version as well, with no feature restrictions. It uses OneDrive for storage, which gives anyone who signs up 25GB of space absolutely for free. Should you pay for an Office 365 account, you'll get 1TB of space all told, although that space is shared among other Office Online apps. Google Keep and Zoho Notebook also have generous free plans. Note-Taking Features Milanote lets you create, edit, and save notes and notebooks. Think of notebooks as pasteboards, along the lines of those in Pinterest, but beefier. To each pasteboard, you can add images, arrows and lines, free-form text notes, and column notes, which are essentially notes with a header. You can also add notebooks within notebooks. I tested the app for a few days in Chrome and Firefox. It ran much better in Chrome, with the Firefox version sometimes becoming unresponsive or sluggish. According to a representative, Milanote backs up everything you create instantly and forever. When my power cut out unexpectedly and my computer crashed, I was impressed to see that the letters I had typed into one of my notes were all there when I rebooted. The app doesn't keep histories of notes, however, so you can't restore an older version of a note. According to the same representative, the feature may be added later. He added that the team handles restore requests manually on a case-by-case basis for now. Evernote Premium and Microsoft OneNote already offer the ability to restore older versions of notes. A neat feature I have not seen in other note-taking apps before is a drawer off to the right of your pasteboard in which you can put notes that you have not yet sorted into an appropriate notebook. Other note-taking apps have their own solutions or workarounds for unsorted notes, such as creating an Inbox notebook to serve as the default for all notes until you sort and categorize them, but I like the concept of the drawer because you can see it no matter which notebook you're viewing. Real-Time Collaboration Milanote's real-time collaboration impresses me. You can share any board by entering your intended collaborator's email address or copying a link and deciding whether the person should have read-only or editing privileges. When another person with editing privileges joins your board and begins making changes while you're still viewing and editing the board, you see the objects they select highlighted and marked with their initials. It's similar to the way real-time collaboration looks in Google Suite apps. There aren't any extra tools for collaborating, though, so you won't see dedicated spaces for having an asynchronous chat conversation, for example. You could always create a text box on the board and simply use it to write notes back and forth to one another—a less elegant but viable solution. If you want to share boards in other ways, you can export them to a variety of formats, such as PDF, PDF canvas, Markdown text, plain text, and as Word documents. What's Missing I've mentioned in passing that Milanotes main drawback is its lack of features, such as apps for other platforms and a change history of notes. I would like to note, however, that while it doesn't offer dedicated mobile apps, you can access your account via mobile browser. The experience was not great when I tested it on an iPhone, however. A bunch of images wouldn't load, for example. Plus, without a dedicated app, you don't have the ability to save notebooks offline, and you don't get interactive features aimed at touch screens, like drawing and handwriting. Milanote doesn't even have a set of tools for drawing, beyond the ability to make arrows and lines. Milanote doesn't support handwritten notes, nor does it offer optical character recognition (OCR). OCR translates handwriting and pictures of text into searchable, editable, copy-able text. Milanotes does not have the ability to record audio notes, nor does it have a web clipper. Evernote, OneNote, and Zoho Notebook all have both of those features. Web clippers are browser extensions that let you quickly save content from the web, as if you were clipping an old-school magazine or newspaper article, into a notebook. I use this feature for saving recipes, and it's excellent for academic research and many other uses. Milanote also lacks tags. Tags are another feature I use on recipe notes so I can quickly look through all my recipes that are "chocolate" based for example, or all "appetizers." If you're a serious note-taker, tags are of key importance as they help you sort and resort your notes in all sorts of useful ways. At this time, there aren't any integrations with other services offered nor an API, although those are next on the roadmap for Milanote. Revisit In Six Months Given the visual, pasteboard nature of Milanote, it invites comparison with some of the best note-taking apps for iPad, namely Penultimate and Notability. To compare favorably, however, Milanote will have to add the ability to draw and write by hand to take full advantage of the touch screen and stylus that many people use when making visual notes. Given that it lacks these features, I'm currently more inclined to compare it with Evernote and OneNote, the two top productivity products in the more general note-taking and syncing apps category. Either way, Milanote has a long way to go to catch up to the competition. What it offers isn't terrible, but it's missing such a long list of features compared with other apps in its class that there's just no reason to choose it right now. By all means tinker with the free version if you find sampling note-taking apps appealing, and then revisit it in six months or so when it's further along.

The big change coming to the next Apple TV is 4K video support, and not much else. Apple ready to bring 4K video support to Apple TV Insider sources speaking with Bloomberg said the new Apple TV will support 4K video and “more vivid colors,” which hints at high dynamic range (HDR) support, too. That’ll help bring Apple TV on par with devices like Amazon’s Fire TV and Google’s Chromecast, but it doesn’t do much to set it apart. Despite the new TV app, Apple TV doesn’t do much to improve the content viewing experience. Apple TV is still too app-centric, forcing users to jump from app to app to watch the shows they like instead of offering a unified viewing interface. The TV app attempts to address that, but only in the feeblest of terms. The app lists upcoming episodes for shows you’re watching, but only for services that have signed on to work with TV. Right now, that includes Apple’s own services, and several networks including HBO—no Amazon Prime support, and Netflix limited its support to searching through its library of old TV shows. Selecting a show jumps you out of the TV app and to the app for the network, studio, or service that’s streaming what you want to watch. In essence, TV is a content searching app. Apple TV: 4K, and Maybe More Right now all we’re hearing about is 4K support, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other changes coming to the next Apple TV. Apple could make some big interface changes in tvOS 11 that focus more on content than apps, and now that developers can make bigger Apple TV apps we could see more interesting games come to the platform, too. Apple also recently hired Timothy Twerdahl as vice president of product marketing for Apple TV. He previously served as the product marketing vice president for Amazon’s Fire TV product line, and worked for Roku and Netflix, too. His presence may be a sign Apple is ready to get serious about competing in the set top box market. Eddy Cue may have hinted at the Apple TV’s importance in Apple’s entertainment master plan. Apple is on the hunt for compelling original scripted shows for Apple Music, and subscribers will need a convenient way to stream them to their televisions. Apple TV fits that bill nicely, and is far more elegant than making users stream from their computer, iPhone, or iPad. Still, if Apple’s big plan for the fifth generation Apple TV is 4K video, maybe it’s time to look for a new product manager.

Check out Florida's exciting travel destinations Theme Park Rangers No one knows more about Orlando's famous attractions Florida Travel Orlando Attractions Theme Park Rangers Volcano Bay: What's up with Waturi and other water-park wonders Volcano Bay water park at Universal Orlando Universal Orlando Universal's Volcano Bay water park will open to the public on May 25. Universal's Volcano Bay water park will open to the public on May 25. (Universal Orlando) Dewayne Bevil Contact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Now that we have a grand opening date for Universal Orlando’s Volcano Bay (it’s May 25 BTW), I’ve been re-reading up about the water park and its offerings. Here are five of my related musings and burning questions that we expect to have answered in the weeks ahead. 1. The names of Volcano Bay’s attractions are, I’m told, “island-inspired” --  but not rooted in any one particular culture or region. It appears that some are named more after real places such as Krakatau and that some are clever wordplay (Runamukka Reef, I see what you did there). But what about Waturi, the name of our new Interstate 4-adjacent island? I was thinking punny in a waturi = watery sort of thing. But maybe it’s a real place? Google says … no. But wait. A character named Mr. Waturi was in a 1991 movie starring Tom Hanks. Waturi, played by Dan Hedaya, was the boss in … “Joe Versus the Volcano.” Discuss. 2. What’s this? Universal makes passing mention of “two-story cabanas.” I’m doubly intrigued. First look: Volcano Bay's TapuTapu wearable tech » 3. According to the June operating hours listed for Volcano Bay on Universal’s website, the water park will be open as late as 10 p.m. Let’s assume that’s so we can have an adult beverage and watch the volcano do its thing. Aquatica, SeaWorld’s water park, lists its closing time as 5 p.m. every day in June, and the Walt Disney World water parks – Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach – close as late as 8 p.m. that month. 4. We’re very forgiving when it comes to artist renderings. In the Volcano Bay art, the interstate — which looks thisfreakyclose to the slides in real life — is completely out of the picture, helping to make the visuals so lovely. We get it. We’re a little confused about that hilly terrain in the background. Kissimmee’s pretty flat, right? (Mount Dora is the other direction.) 5. The future of annual passes, not to mention the single-day prices for VB, remains a mystery. But surely there will be an option that lumps Volcano Bay onto an annual pass with Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure theme parks. But would that force me to give up my old-school, longstanding plastic-with-photo annual pass, the one they’ll have to pry from my cold, dead hands?  Stay tuned. dbevil@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5477 Universal's Mardi Gras marches on » Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Pictures: Orlando's newest rides and attractions Pictures: Top 50 theme-park attractions Orlando theme park and attractions discounts All Sections News Sports Business Classified Entertainment Travel Obituaries 53°
Toggle navigation Spoilers Exclusives Report Cards Watch TV Online Photo Galleries Riverdale Thursdays 9:00 PM on The CW Follow Riverdale News Riverdale Reviews Riverdale Watch Online Riverdale Episode Guide Riverdale Quotes Riverdale Pictures Riverdale Videos Riverdale Round Tables × Follow Riverdale Riverdale Season 1 Episode 4 Review: Chapter Four: The Last Picture Show Justin Carreiro at February 16, 2017 10:05 pm. Comments It finally happened! This is the moment I've been waiting for all season. (And it's only been four episodes...) The affair is over. Ms. Grundy packed up her bags and hightailed it out of town on Riverdale Season 1 Episode 4. Let's savor this development for a second. First and foremost, I don't hate the character. She had an interesting backstory for all the lies. And Sarah Habel, who portrayed Ms. Grundy, did a fine job making her seem timid yet manipulative. This has more to do with the teacher-student affair storyline. I've seen this trope done to death before in teen dramas. I didn't want them to dive too much into this plot. Luckily it only lasted four episodes. And we also got an extra mystery thrown in to explain this younger Ms. Grundy. Betty: Ms. Grundy showed up in Riverdale a year ago, out of thin air. There is no record of her before that. Her Facebook, her LinkedIn account...they were all created a year ago. Before that she's a ghost, she doesn't exist. The only 'Geraldine Grundy' I could find was a woman who died seven years ago. Archie: Where did you find all this? Veronica: The deep web, the dark internet. Check it, it's all online...simple Googling. Permalink: Ms. Grundy showed up in Riverdale a year ago, out of thin air. There is no record of her before Did anyone hope a relationship would start between Mr. Andrews and Ms. Grundy? I didn't. Our Riverdale round table didn't want it either. There was something brewing in this storyline, and Mr. Andrews was making his intentions known. I'm glad this was nipped this in the bud early on. I wouldn't be able to handle the creepiness of that triangle. It would become too much of a tragedy. I'd rather see a romance rekindle between Mr. Andrews and Hermoine Lodge. Betty and Veronica working together to investigate Ms. Grundy continued to show the perfection of this friendship. Whereas on Riverdale Season 1 Episode 3, Veronica was the tough one taking the lead, now it was Betty's turn. She put the pieces together. She interviewed Ms. Grundy, and she broke into the car. She is the Nancy Drew of Riverdale. Betty: Bobby pin. Veronica: Okay, Ms. Guyver. [Unlocks box] Betty: I learned that from the Nancy Drew detective handbook. Permalink: I learned that from the Nancy Drew detective handbook. Camila Mendes and Lili Reinhart continue to have great chemistry. I loved every minute of their scenes together. Betty and Veronica balance each other, and it was shown perfectly. When one is more dominant, the other is caring. But they are still strong as solo characters. Veronica: What's happening out there? Do we know? Is it about me? Jughead: I have a strong inkling, and no. Also, I'd let it go. Veronica: Yes, but you're you and I'm me. You do you, girl. I'll be back. [She leaves] Kevin: What was it like before she got here? I honestly cannot remember. Permalink: Yes, but you're you and I'm me. You do you, girl. I'll be back. Do you think Mrs. Cooper will keep Archie's affair a secret? She got what she wanted and got Ms. Grundy to leave town. However, Alice doesn't seem like the type to let things fade away. She has vital information for a juicy story. Though, Betty did cross her mother. I would be afraid if I were Betty right now. This will no doubt come back to haunt her, especially if she does start dating Archie. Is Kevin's dad both strangely cool and embarrassing? He just might be. He not only pushed his son to start dating but also tells him to not hookup with people. It made the moment funnier hearing the sheriff say this. Kevin must've been dying of embarrassment. Kevin: Can I borrow the truck for the drive-in? Sheriff Keller: You got a date? Kevin: No, I'm going with Veronica. Sheriff Keller: Ah okay. Isn't there a nice gay kid at your school? Kevin: Yes, there is. Me. Sheriff Keller: Alright. No cruising guys tonight. We both know what goes in those woods. Kevin: Oh my God, Dad! Permalink: Alright. No cruising guys tonight. We both know what goes in those woods. I don't think there's a connection between Kevin making out with the Southside Serpent and his dad's wall being vandalized. That's too much of a coincidence. They must be completely separate storylines. Joaquin seems like an interesting character. I have a feeling there might be a "West Side Story" element to this (with less dancing and one less gang). But I wouldn't put stock in this character; he doesn't seem like Kevin's endgame. Though, it's great to see Casey Cott start to develop his own storyline. It would've been a shame if he was only used as the gay best friend role. Now we just need Josie to be utilized more for a well-rounded group. Where was she? The downside of large ensembles is that not everyone gets enough screen time. Though, Josie has been the least utilized so far. Hopefully, they make up for it next time. Cheryl at least popped in to push the side plot and deliver great lines. If I would have known Mama Lodge was working as a waitress at Pop's, I never would've given Veronica a spot on the Vixens. It's off-brand and it sends a false message of acceptance. Cheryl Permalink: It's off-brand and it sends a false message of acceptance. Speaking of the second plot, did you think Jughead would be able to save the drive-in? There was some serious shadiness with this deal. You usually know when someone purchases land and what they plan to do with it. This was all a big secret. Something was up. Kudos for subtly highlighting the corruption of Riverdale. This was the episode that made it known the town isn't as idyllic as we thought. Not including the murder, of course. I thought Mayor McCoy, played by Robin Givens, would be a trustworthy character. I was wrong in that regard. She is just as secretive as the others. The biggest surprise was Mrs. Lodge. After three episodes of her being a nice mother, she showed her devious side. She's just as much a part of all the deals than originally thought. Sure, she's trying to protect Veronica and finish the mess her husband started. However, she's still going along with it. Who knows what she's planning to do next. Jughead's past being a main point of the hour was a nice touch for the character. We didn't know much about him before, except his writing and friendship with Archie. I love that we got a new side to him. Did anyone expect the twist with his father? I didn't. This move caught me off guard. I think the Southside Serpents will play a bigger role in the story. Jughead can't simply be related to the leader without it be connected somehow. They affected the drive-in, but who knows what else? What did you think of "Chapter Four: The Last Picture Show"? Will Ms. Grundy return to Riverdale? Who do you think destroyed Sheriff Keller's wall? Does Cheryl secretly want to be friends with Archie and friends?

Login Register Public Release: 16-Feb-2017 Online-only pharmacies that don't require prescriptions could fuel antibiotic resistance Imperial College London Share  Print  E-Mail The researchers from Imperial College London analysed 20 pharmacies that were available for UK citizens to access online. This is one of the few studies to have examined the online availability of antibiotics and to have explored the potential effects on public health. The research is published in Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. Antibiotics are classed as prescription only medicines in the UK, meaning they cannot legally be sold to consumers without a valid prescription. In the study, the researchers found that although online versions of UK high street pharmacies were compliant with prescription regulations, 80 per cent of the online pharmacies surveyed let customers choose their dosages, the duration and choice of antibiotic treatments. This can lead to serious side effects in patients and increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is one the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The study was carried out by academics from Imperial College London's NIHR Health Protection Research Unit for Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance, and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. The team carried out their research by entering the search term 'buy antibiotics online' into Google and Yahoo. The team recognise that the study is a 'snapshot' of the online pharmacy industry, but it does provide insights into how it operates. The 20 pharmacies at the top of the search were analysed by the team. Dr Sara Boyd, a co-author and NIHR Academic Clinical Fellow in Infectious Diseases and Microbiology at Imperial, said: "These findings are a real concern, and raise several important issues regarding antibiotic resistance and patient safety with online pharmacies." All online medicine vendors selling to UK consumers must by law register with both the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the General Pharmaceutical Council (or the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland). However, the researchers found that 75 per cent of online pharmacies included in the study lacked evidence of the appropriate registration status required by law. In other findings, the researchers discovered that 45 per cent of the online pharmacies analysed did not require a prescription from the patient. Only 30 per cent of websites in the survey asked consumers to complete a health questionnaire prior to purchase. Seventy per cent of the websites provided information on the safe usage of prescription medications, including potential side effects or adverse reactions when combined with other drugs. Professor Alison Holmes, of Imperial's Department of Medicine, added: "Improper use of antibiotics can mean that infections are not being treated appropriately, or that people are being unnecessarily exposed to antibiotics. This allows bacteria to become resistant to drugs that once killed them. As a result, it is essential that antibiotics are prescribed only when they are needed." Although a small study, the authors say that the research offers insight into the increasing use of the internet for a variety of purposes, including buying antibiotics. Dr Boyd said: "The way patients interact with healthcare is constantly evolving, and shifts in consumer behaviour mean more people are purchasing their goods online. Our study paves the way for larger, more thorough research into this worrying new trend so that we can ensure patient safety and promote the responsible use of antibiotics in all areas of healthcare provision." Martin Astbury, President of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: "Unnecessary antibiotic use can result in serious side effects in individuals and has a major impact on wider public health by increasing antibiotic resistance. We cannot support access to antibiotics through a web form until the standards for prescribing by private providers reflect the standard of face to face consultations in the NHS. Those involved in supplying medicines online should ensure their processes are as robust as possible." All online pharmacies identified as illegally selling antibiotics to patients within the UK were reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), who promptly responded. The researchers are working together with numerous stakeholders to improve patient safety and antibiotic stewardship in this area. Anyone with a concern concerns about an online pharmacy should contact the MHRA directly. ### The study was partially funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance at Imperial College London, in partnership with Public Health England and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust.

Meanwhile, Canadian carrier Rogers has also released the Nougat firmware for the Sony Xperia X Performance. According to Xperia Blog, owners of Sony Xperia Z5 series, Xperia Z3+, and Xperia Z4 Tablet should begin receiving Android 7.0 Nougat update following the tech company’s suspension of the rollout last month because of a number of issues. The new Nougat firmware comes with build number 32.3.A.0.376 and hopefully, it resolves all the bugs and problems found in the initial update (32.3.A.0.372). [Image by David Ramos/Getty Images] Well, based on a comment posted under the Xperia Blog’s report, the new build was indeed able to fix issues found on the previous rollout. Shehab Skull who flashed the Nougat firmware to one of the aforementioned Sony Xperia models noted in his comment that the Bluetooth battery drain experienced in the first Nougat build has been fixed. “Battery looks better and DOZE mode is working perfectly,” the commenter also shared, further adding the following. “3 days since the update.. the phone really looks smoother than before.. even my Samsung fanboy friend told me that my phone is so smooth! I have also to say that the camera app is faster than ever..” “I definitely am not satisfied with this,” another commenter shared. “I was hoping that this might have been the update for Sony to redeem itself, but it isn’t, and they’ll probably lose most of the Z5 users soon, in rage,” he added. Sony Xperia X Performance, specifically the Roger-branded version of the smartphone, is also starting to receive the Android Nougat update. Aside from the Android 7.0 OS, the firmware build released by the Canadian carrier is also bringing in VoLTE support. In addition to the Sony Xperia X Performance, Rogers has also made the Android Nougat update available for their HTC One M9 units. Furthermore, Rogers’ Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge units are still yet to receive Google’s latest iteration of its mobile operating system. There’s no specific timeframe disclosed for these 2017 flagship models’ Nougat firmware, but the carrier’s release schedule noted that it is “coming soon.” [Image by Sean Gallup/Getty Images] Speaking of Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, Phone Arena conducted a test on these smartphones that are currently running on Android Nougat. While Android’s latest major iteration is expected to bring in a plethora of new features and goodies, unfortunately, the test yielded undesirable results, specifically for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge’s battery. Phone Arena noted the following: “We tested both the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, expecting to see them perform even better with Google’s latest update and improvements. Sadly, we saw the opposite: battery life on both phones has actually worsened by up to some 10 percent.” For instance, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with Android Nougat only got six hours and 35 minutes while the similar smartphone model with Android Marshmallow scored seven hours and ten minutes. “We have run the tests carefully and double-checked for mistakes, but the results were consistent,” the post added. The Android Nougat update for Rogers’ Sony Xperia X Performance as well as for the Xperia Z5 family, Z3+ and Z4 Tablet units can be accessed via Over-The-Air or OTA process. Make sure to connect to a stable Wi-fi connection to avoid unwanted data charges when downloading and installing the firmware update files. Also, it is best to fully charge the phone first (or, at least, have 85 percent remaining power) before pushing through the update process. Some of the highlights of the Android Nougat OS are the multi-window support, enhanced Doze mode, new emojis, Multi-Locale language settings, bundled notifications, custom Quick Settings, more personalization options, among others.

You won't find them at Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile or Sprint. Josh Miller/CNET Phones by Jessica Dolcourt February 12, 2017 5:00 AM PST @jdolcourt Despite the dozens of phones to choose from every time you walk into a carrier store, there are still plenty of great phones you can't buy there. Some never make it to the US (though we wish they would), but others can be had from online stores like Amazon, Best Buy or the manufacturer's own website. Just two things to remember: You'll need to confirm that any phone you buy online will work with your carrier choice (your carrier's website will have a compatibility tool). If the phone isn't locked to a carrier network, you may not be able to use features like Wi-Fi calling or HD Voice. OnePlus 3T Our Editors' Choice for best midprice phone, you can pick up the OnePlus 3T directly from OnePlus' site. The 64GB version will cost you $440. OnePlus 3T ups the ante on an already great phone On the heels of launching its flagship phone months ago, OnePlus is releasing the 3T with a faster processor, a bigger battery and new software tricks. by Lynn La 2:11 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Xiaomi Mi Mix This ceramic-backed beauty is one of the first phones to feature a nearly bezel-less design.

February 16, 2017 5:54 PM   Subscribe Here's an example of makeup. Here are even more from the same page: makeup and makeup. What is this product, what is it for. This has been mystifying me for several years and it is very difficult for me to Google because I get back responses having to do with what I think of as makeup: lipstick, eyeshadow, concealer, foundation, etc. Makeup is all of those things. But makeup is also apparently a specific type of cosmetic...what does it do? Hopefully this will be the easiest question in the world to answer for someone who knows even a little bit more about cosmetics than I do. posted by Danila to Clothing, Beauty, & Fashion (6 answers total)   What you're looking at there is more often referred to as foundation. It makes skin look smoother. It comes in a range of thicknesses, from quite lightweight that just adds a light smooth layer over the skin, to heavy enough to cover blemishes and moles. posted by fingersandtoes at 5:56 PM on February 16 [3 favorites] you are looking for foundation. if you go to a place like Sephora or Ulta a salesperson can give you some one-on-one help through various brands/types etc., help you pick the type and color best for you. posted by supermedusa at 5:58 PM on February 16 I think the problem here is that most people use 'makeup' to refer to the general category of all cosmetics, but the brand Clinique has a weird affectation where they use it specifically to refer to foundation. If you go to Sephora and click on Makeup (their general category for foundation, blush, eyeliner, etc.), the Foundation, and then limit the brand to Clinique, you get all the products that you linked to. posted by ArbitraryAndCapricious at 6:10 PM on February 16 [3 favorites] Yes, these are versions of foundation-- also called makeup, and the sheer, skin moisturizing versions are sometimes called BB Cream or CC cream or tinted moisturizer-- but they all belong to the same category. You pick the color that matches your existing skin tone and apply it to your face. Depending on the formulation, it can be a light, sheer layer that evens out the color/tone of your face and makes you look more put-together and refreshed; it can be a powder you can apply with a light or heavy hand; it can be a thicker, more matte layer designed to cover blemishes or shine or hide wrinkles, etc., and everything in between. Not everyone who wears other cosmetics wears it-- I'd say it's far less common than mascara or lip color. posted by kapers at 6:12 PM on February 16 [3 favorites] Yes thank you! It's a Clinique thing! My aunt sells Clinique so I often buy their products and this has been bugging me for a long time but I didn't notice it was their thing they do. Also I was confused because Clinique definitely has products they call "foundation" like everyone else in the world but that's obviously not typical for them. Sadly, I own this, I use it regularly and of course it's my foundation. I never even noticed they call it "makeup". Mystery solved! posted by Danila at 6:20 PM on February 16 [1 favorite] Don't feel bad, all that stuff is named and packaged so as to be as mysterious as possible. And if you think cosmetic terms are bad, wait til you try to figure what on earth skin care products are supposed to do. posted by fingersandtoes at 6:26 PM on February 16 [3 favorites] « Older Inexpensive body wipes that don't smell funny?...   |   College recommendation for CompSci Newer » You are not logged in, either login or create an account to post comments Related Questions Please help shine some light on the mysteries of...

It started about a week ago when she asked her father about his job, and if there were anywhere else, he'd like to work. He then told her about Google and showed her pictures of those really cool offices full of slides, and go-karts and so on.  It didn't take long for her to start writing her letter to the "Google boss." In the letter, she tells Pichai how she'd like to work in a chocolate factory or swim in the Olympics when she grows up. She brags a bit about how the teachers tell her parents she's doing well in school, probably to sway the Google CEO to her side.  To everyone's surprise, they actually received a letter back signed by Pichai himse... » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit News - 13 hours ago< > Embed 7-Year-Old Girl Applies for Job at Google 00:39 A very ambitious 7-year-old girl made it onto Google CEO Sundar Pichai's radar when she mailed the company a handwritten "job application”.

Plus more change on the way at the ABC, and some potential crossed lines at Fairfax Louis Theroux picking up an award in London this week. His work made a surprise appearance on ABC’s Media Watch. Photograph: James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Thursday 16 February 2017 20.58 EST First published on Thursday 16 February 2017 20.56 EST ABC’s Media Watch had some unusual captions when it was posted on the corporation’s iView earlier this week, spotted by writer Jane Howard. Jane Howard (@noplain) Hello, @ABCmediawatch? I have a story for you. It's about your captions on iView ... pic.twitter.com/eLSG6mwV3n February 13, 2017 The captions had presenter Paul Barry talking about having sex on camera and saying he felt like an “arsehole”. “How did that go? Do you feel closer now that you’ve just had sex,” Barry was apparently saying with his trademark smirk. So Weekly Beast asked Barry and the ABC what was going on.He initially thought it was a fake; and ABC corporate affairs told us the captions must be an aberration on one person’s device because they looked fine when they went out. But it wasn’t as straightforward as that. After more questions and a deeper investigation by the technical team, the ABC finally came clean. “ABC TV technicians have, after a thorough review of the iView website, identified an intermittent bug that led to captions from one program being displayed over another program, on Monday night. The website has now been fixed and the ABC has not received any complaints from audience members regarding this issue.” And the program whose captions inadvertently ended up coming out of Barry’s mouth? Louis Theroux’s Twilight of the Porn Stars of course. Paul Barry (@TheRealPBarry) Ha ha! Pretty sure this fake, but captions are apparently from Louis Theroux's show. His job is obviously even more fun than mine. https://t.co/YiCY4qkTNH February 14, 2017 In one of his new Media Bites videos – snippets which appear online in between Monday’s TV program – Barry has made fun of the cock-up. Guthrie’s new zoom ABC managing director Michelle Guthrie has told staff she is planning a big shake-up “to shape the ABC of 2017 and beyond”. It will be unveiled next month following the seal of approval from an ABC board meeting next week. The former Google executive says she wants to “best maximise ABC resources” to offer audiences “the content that they expect”. Her supporters say she wants to get rid of a layer of bureaucracy to free up resources for content. Her detractors say she wants to introduce a new layer of management to centralise control over content out of her office. Some of this clearing work has already been done as directors Angela Clarke, Lynley Marshall, David Pendleton and Richard Finlayson have resigned in recent months, leaving the remaining directors a little nervous about their future. In the all-staff newsletter, Guthrie talked about the valuable feedback from staff through “Zoom online workshops”, the “Executive Leadership Forum” and the “Think X project group”. ABC's Fact Check unit relaunched in partnership with RMIT Read more “It is clear from these discussions that there is real alignment that in order to prosper in the current media environment, the ABC must adapt its practices and operations,” she said. Meanwhile Radio National looks set for a shake-up of its own. The new head of talk radio Judith Whelan, brought in last year by the director of radio Michael Mason, has been touring the country talking to RN staff about how they have to change. One of the handouts said: “While the network has undergone a great deal of change, including program renewal, schedule changes and an increased focus on digital content over the past five years, our production has now reached an unsustainable level.” More program and staff cuts? Some of the more experienced radio producers were less than impressed to hear Whelan, who has no experience in radio, tell them they had to get bigger audiences by using Twitter and Facebook because there was no money for marketing. Woman’s Day apology for Hogan blunder Paul Hogan’s family found itself of renewed interest to the media following the production of the Channel Seven miniseries Hoges. Woman’s Day published a story about Hogan’s first wife Noelene, after she was papped out shopping in Sydney. Hoges review – biopic bombs badly as Josh Lawson parodies Paul Hogan instead of playing him Read more “Despite reports to the contrary, Noelene and her husband Reg Stretton are happier than ever and were spotted shopping for homewares in Sydney recently,” Woman’s Day reported. “The cute pair, who married in 2000, are even planning a special celebration for their 17th wedding anniversary on March 21. ‘Reg’s simple nature and easygoing attitude is perfect for Noelene,” sources say. “He is — and always has been — her rock.’” But Hogan’s granddaughter Mylee Hogan, a Seven reporter, was quick to call the magazine out. Woman's Day magazine (@WomansDayAus) @MyleeHogan sincere apologies to you and your family. This was a genuine mistake and we are sorry if it caused distress to your loved ones. February 13, 2017 “Despite the fact this is wrong, it’s disrespectful. Reg has been dead for many years. This is a photo of my nan out with her son”,” she said on Twitter. The magazine responded on Twitter with an apology. “Sincere apologies to you and your family. This was a genuine mistake and we are sorry if it caused distress to your loved ones.” Weekly Beast asked Bauer Media, which publishes the mag, how this could have happened and where they got the quotes from. “Woman’s Day incorrectly identified Noelene’s son as her late husband and has apologised to the family,” the editor in chief, Fiona Connolly, said in a statement. Split personality The changes at Fairfax this week have blurred the lines about who is ultimately responsible for editorial. The position of editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age has been abolished. New editors Lisa Davies (SMH) and Alex Lavelle (Age) have responsibility for the local news on each masthead while James Chessell takes charge of national, international and political news across both mastheads. So who will take overall responsibility for opinion and leader comment? Sean Aylmer, Fairfax Media’s editorial director, whose role is mainly managerial. If you only read the Australian’s own reports on circulation and readership you’d be forgiven for thinking the newspaper business was a roaring success. “A 12% rise in digital subscriptions drove up sales at The Australian and The Weekend Australian, the only major news­papers to record year-on-year growth,” media editor Darren Davidson reported this week. “Fresh from posting weekday readership growth of 5.1%, the biggest rise of any daily newspaper, total paid masthead sales of the Monday-to-Friday edition pushed 1.9% higher to an all-time high of 180,435.” On the other hand the latest results from News Corporation’s Australian operations saw a $703m write-down on the newspapers and Foxtel. Advertising revenue for the mastheads, which include the Oz, the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun, was down 15%. #AddAFish The #bringthemhere campaign co-ordinated by the media union MEAA had a boost when the petition was signed by journalist Peter Greste, who was himself wrongfully imprisoned for a year in Cairo. The campaign is aimed at lobbying the Turnbull government to bring to Australia the journalist Behrouz Boochani, cartoonist Eaten Fish, and actor Mehdi Savari, all asylum seekers from Iran who have been detained on Manus Island since 2013. Eaten Fish is three weeks into a hunger strike. Last year he received the 2016 Award for Courage in Editorial Cartooning from Cartoonists Rights Network International and they are again rallying for him by encouraging illustrators from around the world to tweet a drawing or cartoon with the hashtag #AddAFish. One of his advocates in Australia is your very own First Dog on the Moon.

By Mike Isaac New York Times  February 17, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Thursday stepped into the raging debate about globalization. In a 5,800-word letter he posted publicly, Zuckerberg expressed alarm that what was once considered normal — seeking global connection — was now seen by people and governments around the world as something undesirable. Advertisement He pledged that he would push Facebook, which has more than 1.8 billion users worldwide, in a direction that would help convince individuals and governments that “progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.” The letter comes close to a political statement by a chief executive who, as the leader of a global company, is essentially arguing against a tide of isolationism that is rising across the world. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Zuckerberg, 32, chose to make the statement as an update to his original founder’s letter, which was published in 2012 when Facebook went public. In that letter, he wrote that the social network “was built to accomplish a social mission — to make the world more open and connected.” In an interview this week at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Zuckerberg said that when he started Facebook, “the idea of connecting the world was not controversial. The default assumption was that the world was just incrementally moving in that direction. Now, that’s actually a real question.” Zuckerberg released his missive amid a fierce debate over the merits of globalization. In the United States, President Trump has displayed a deep streak of nationalism. Last year, Britain voted to quit the European Union. Those moves and others have been taken as signs of how globalization has caused strains — making it more difficult for companies to navigate a new world order. Advertisement Against that backdrop, the timing of Zuckerberg’s letter is notable. While other technology executives, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, regularly update their founder letters each year — often tied to financial results — it is the first time Zuckerberg has refreshed Facebook’s mission statement since the company’s initial public offering. Zuckerberg said his reasons for writing the updated letter began to take shape before last year’s presidential election, spurred by broader trends. He said he recognized that more people were feeling left behind by globalization, and by societal and technological changes. As a result, he wanted to focus different parts of Facebook in a way that helped people better come together. “We have to build a global community that works for everyone,” he said. “I really don’t have much doubt that this is the right direction to go in the long term.” Zuckerberg said he planned to reorient Facebook, which turned 13 this month, around these new realities. The letter is filled with abstract ideas, including the notion of “social infrastructure” and how to create stronger online communities, with few detailed steps about how to realize those goals. One top priority is building inclusive online communities that are supportive, safe, and informed environments, to help strengthen bonds in the offline world as well. Zuckerberg also stressed the idea of using Facebook to create this “social infrastructure” — essentially a digital means of connecting people around shared interests — mirroring social groups in the physical world like churches, governments, and unions. That may encourage connections among people that transcend national and international barriers, he said. While Zuckerberg mentioned several concrete steps that Facebook has taken toward some of these goals, he gave few other specifics. He also did not address how his vision might conflict with those of political leaders around the world. Getting to this point did not come easily. Since going public, Facebook has been on a growth tear, steadily marching toward becoming one of the world’s biggest and most valuable public entities. Yet the power that Facebook has amassed has raised hackles globally. The social network is blocked in China, has stumbled in India, and is facing a thicket of regulatory questions in Europe. More recently, Trump’s election prompted an outcry over whether Facebook influenced the American electorate with false stories on its site. The company has scrambled to contain the fallout, undertaking several experiments to better sort through what people see on its site. A key moment for Zuckerberg’s shift in thinking about how to be a global company happened six months ago. In September, Facebook censored an iconic photograph that featured a naked 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. Zuckerberg said the image, titled “The Terror of War,” was rightly censored by Facebook at the time because the company’s content policies did not allow child nudity. Facebook users disagreed, arguing that the photograph was not titillating but rather illustrated the perils of modern warfare. The social network eventually allowed the image to be posted on its site, noting that it had inherent news value. Zuckerberg said the episode made him realize how ineffective Facebook’s content policy was at a global scale, given that cultural norms vary greatly by country. He said Facebook needed to get to a place in which users could perhaps choose their own content policies based on local laws and preferences, a marked departure from the company’s blanket global approach of the past decade or more. “I don’t think that we, sitting here in California, are best positioned to know what the norms in communities around the world should be,” Zuckerberg said. “At some point, you just need a more dynamic system where people can just express that themselves.” Zuckerberg spent much of his letter focused on the importance of personal relationships. He pointed to “very meaningful groups” — Facebook groups that people frequently engage in and return to — that are often centered on topics like parenting, sports, or other shared interests. When people find an interest they are passionate about and form such a group, they are some of the most tightly connected relationships on Facebook, he said. To foster more of these groups in a safe way, Zuckerberg said that Facebook needed to change some of the ways that it operates. That includes improving community safety with product updates similar to Facebook’s “safety check,” a tool that lets people mark themselves safe during world catastrophes. Zuckerberg said that governments regularly called Facebook to activate Safety Check during crises like the massacre at a nightclub in Paris last year. Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook’s role in keeping communities well-informed, which will necessitate tackling misinformation and highly polarized news. He alluded to Facebook’s shifting role as a distributor of news, saying that the social network is “not just technology or media.” Facebook’s goal, Zuckerberg said, was not to usurp traditional institutions like governments, religious groups, and other communities that share interests. (When asked if he wanted to run for president of the United States, he laughed and declined.) Instead, he said, creating tightly knit online groups would make these traditional institutions stronger. It also would not hurt that such groups and connections could well make Facebook more essential to people. “There’s a social infrastructure that needs to get built to deal with modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,” Zuckerberg said. “I just think it would be good if more people thought about things like this.” Loading comments...

He expected Loon to be partnering in coming months with telecom companies to provide internet to “real users,” in a step up from tests done to see how well the high-floating technology works with networks on the ground. Teller declined to specify where Loon might first be integrated into telecommunications networks providing service to customers. “We are not going to all of a sudden be everywhere,” Teller said. “We intend to be part of an ecosystem — in any country where we are doing testing we would work with a local telco.” Part of the money-making vision for Loon would be to get revenue from telecom operators for extending their reach. Teller said Loon is one of the more mature projects at X and that it “would be a natural state to graduate into its own company” but there were not plans at the moment for that to happen. The peek inside X lab and word of speedy progress came the same day that the venture to beam the internet to remote areas of the world via balloon has hit a legal snag in Sri Lanka that could see the project abandoned on the island. Project Loon uses roaming balloons to beam internet coverage and planned to connect Sri Lanka’s 21 million people to the web, even those in remote connectivity black spots. But just a year after testing began in Sri Lanka regulators have been unable to allocate Google a radio frequency for the airborne venture without breaching international regulations. The first public launch of Loon took place in New Zealand in 2013, when the project was in an early experimental phase. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Snap co-founder Spiegel inches closer to US$588m payday Zuckerberg envisions Facebook as a ‘global community’ Google adds voice-activated shopping, taking on Amazon Alphabet’s ‘Loon’ internet plan closer to deployment Apple to announce iOS, Mac updates June 5 Focus on Vivo: Chinese smartphone maker known for audio quality, selfies Google brings virtual reality to updated Chrome mobile browser Algorithms: The managers of our digital lives Sony's new 4K Ultra HD TVs, Blu-ray player hit stores in March Apple TV eyes Amazon Fire TV's success Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Related Articles Trump ‘tidak stabil, tidak layak pimpin,’ kata 33 pakar mental Algorithms: The managers of our digital lives Google brings virtual reality to updated Chrome mobile browser Facebook, Google bantu pengguna kesan berita palsu Gergasi internet cabar Trump, speaker UK tidak izin ucapan Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

This was in fact the first handset to launch packing Tango, when it debuted last year. Ever since its release it's been available for $499.99 unlocked, but now you can grab one for less. Exactly $50 less, to be specific. Lenovo's own online store for the US is offering this deal, and it's valid for both color versions of the device: grey and gold. You need to add whichever one you prefer to your cart, and then apply the coupon code PHAB2PRO10, which will take 10% off the recommended retail price, making the actual amount you have to pay $449.99. You also get free standard shipping. Aside from the AR gimmicks, the Phab2 Pro is a decently-specced phone, but it is unashamedly big with its 6.4-inch QHD touchscreen. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 652 chipset, aided by 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. The primary camera is a 16 MP unit, while selfies are taken care of by an 8 MP sensor. The handset has a 4,050 mAh battery and runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.

Friday, February 17, 2017 Helen O’Callaghan Having forked out for their children’s dental work, parents now want to invest in their own teeth. Helen O’Callaghan looks at the growing celeb-driven market for cosmetic dentistry. IT’S my turn now! Words rarely heard by orthodontists 10 years ago. But now, mid-lifers — ultra-conscious their smiles need a tune-up — are saying just this: It’s my turn. “Parents whose children are coming in for treatment will send the kids out and come back to you and say ‘we need to do something about my teeth’,” says Dr Robin Foyle, president-elect of the Irish Dental Association (IDA) and a practising dentist in Wexford. It’s the same at Crotty Orthodontics in Cork where Dr Owen Crotty practises: “Parents will have seen the benefits of orthodontic treatment for their children. They’ll say ‘now it’s time to treat me’.” But midlife mums and dads aren’t the only demographic seeking the perfect smile and contributing to the burgeoning client lists of orthodontists and cosmetic dentists.  “If you were to ask 100 women aged 18-35 if they’d like their teeth a little whiter, 90% would say yes,” says Dr Barry Buckley of Dental Options in Clane. This chimes with results of a 2015 survey of 159 people by Dublin’s Seapoint Clinic: it found nine out of 10 Irish women envy other people’s smiles and long for whiter teeth.  So do men: 52% of them admitted to smile envy and 48% wished their teeth were straighter. At Seapoint Clinic, where clients are as young as 18, Dr Sarah Flannery says they saw their biggest jump in demand for tooth-whitening — 25% — in 2015-16.  In the previous few years, the year-on-year increase was 15%. She recalls one dad coming for teeth whitening because his 15-year-old son told him his teeth were “so dark and embarrassing”. In our social media-driven lives, we’re looking at each other and ourselves — and critically examining ourselves — an awful lot more. We’re FaceTiming, Snapchatting, and constantly taking photos. Small wonder that our smile comes in for scrutiny. The “huge upward curve” Dr Buckley sees in demand for cosmetic dentistry is “an awful lot to do with social media, with the advent of the Kardashians, Instagram, and the emergence of the blogging fraternity, where celebs and non-celebs document all parts of their life”. The 2015 survey found one in five people cite a good smile as the first thing they notice on an online dating profile and 91% say they wouldn’t consider dating someone with bad teeth. More than half said Cheryl Cole has the best smile (with Amy Huberman second at 36%). This doesn’t surprise Dr Buckley.  “If you were to create a postcard of what most young girls want their smile to look like, you’d look at Cheryl Cole. She represents the ideal smile guideline, even for cosmetic dentists.” He gives a rundown of what makes Cole’s smile so compelling: “She has central dominance — her front two teeth dominate her smile, not in a goofy way but in a sexy, attractive way. Another indication of that sexy smile is when the upper teeth rest on the border of the upper lip.” Aesthetic dentists look towards proportionality and symmetry in the teeth, attributes Dr Buckley says are programmed into our DNA to find attractive.  “It’s very rare in nature. When we see these beautiful smiles on celebrities, they’ve been artificially created. Cole has had her teeth straightened with Invisalign, she’s had them veneered with porcelain veneers.” Meanwhile, out in the real world, if your set of gnashers is a long way from straight and pearly white, there’s plenty more than Cole to remind you of that.  Google ‘teeth before and after’ and you’ll find a whole host of celebrities flashing the perfect Hollywood smile — among them Molly Cyrus, Demi Moore, and Katie Price.  And even if your teeth were pretty good to begin with, age delivers the sucker punch. As we get older, teeth naturally darken, explains Dr Flannery.  “The dentine on the inside becomes thicker and stronger. It builds up on the inside of teeth. It’s yellowish and shines through the enamel. As well as that, we pick up stains along the way.” Cosmetic dentists are well used to initial consultations with clients who don’t smile or who have learned to only half-smile or smile with closed lips — anything to divert attention from what they see as imperfections.  “They’ll say they’ve never been comfortable smiling. They hide their teeth a lot. They put their hand over their mouth or turn sideways when they smile,” says Dr Crotty, who cites a 2016 British Orthodontic survey that found 90% of adults — post orthodontic treatment — reporting dramatically improved health and feelings of wellbeing. “In orthodontics, we take a lot of before and after photos. After, you see the difference in their facial appearance, in the clothes they wear — they’re much more confident in how they appear.” It has a huge impact, agrees Dr Flannery, who sees it in clients’ Facebook profile pictures.  “Before treatment, they wouldn’t be smiling or they’d have their lips closed. After, they have these big beaming smiles.” Deirdre Denman, in her late 40s and mum to two university-going children, attended Crotty Orthodontics and had a big job done two years ago.  “I had them straightened, the gaps closed up, and two teeth rotated around that hadn’t been facing forward properly.” The Killarney-based woman says she’s much more confident about smiling.  “It does affect you emotionally. I see them in the mirror now and think ‘oh yeah’. People say ‘Wow! Your teeth are lovely’ and when I ask if they remember them before and show them the pictures, they say ‘oh my God!’” Denman chose not to get her teeth whitened (“I didn’t feel they were discoloured”) but many see it as an easy way to get a smile upgrade. “It’s non-invasive and removes nothing from the teeth,” says Dr Foyle. A 2012 EU Directive set the maximum legal concentration of tooth-whitening product — hydrogen peroxide — at 6% but this can only be prescribed by dentists.  Over-the-counter whitening products are limited to 0.1%.  “Between 0.1% and 6% has to be administered by a dentist,” says Dr Foyle, an IDA representative on the Council of European Dentists and on the Tooth-Whitening Working Group.  He points to three Council of European Dentist surveys (of 350,000 dentists in the EU), which found no damage from tooth-whitening using legal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Tooth whitening involves putting hydrogen peroxide bleach on the teeth and light-activating it. The patient continues the process using trays at home. Fitted over the teeth, trays are thin, clear, and flexible.  After about two weeks, you get a nice white shade. Of course, nobody wants a high-wattage, full beam, Day-Glo smile and, says Dr Flannery, people worry they’ll glow in the dark.  “A good guide is not to go whiter than the white of your eyes.” On average, the effect lasts two years.  “You can maintain it by regular cleaning, good oral hygiene, using whitening toothpaste and touch-up treatments once or twice a year,” says Dr Flannery. Whitening is ideal if teeth are nicely aligned, there are no oral health issues, and the client doesn’t have lots of work already done on front teeth (you can’t bleach crowns or veneers and it doesn’t work well on fillings).  “When you look into someone’s mouth, there can be lots of reasons why bleaching wouldn’t be suitable,” says Dr Flannery. Sensitivity is one.  “It’s a side-effect and resolves once treatment finishes. But if there’s pre-existing sensitivity, teeth can become very sensitive — you need to stop and find out why there’s sensitivity in the first place.” Another no-no is receding gums — the exposed root area won’t whiten.  Heavy drinkers and smokers aren’t good candidates either, unless they’re seriously prepared to cut down on the alcohol and cigs.  “The stains will pick up again,” warns Dr Flannery, who cites tooth-whitening benefits: Youthful smile, improved self-esteem, improved oral hygiene (hydrogen peroxide has a low Ph level that neutralises bacteria), while some studies say it reduces root decay. In-house tooth-whitening can cost anything from €150 to €350. Much cheaper, of course, are over-the-counter products like herbal remedies and whitening toothpaste. But, says Dr Buckley, the only ingredient clinically proven to whiten teeth is hydrogen peroxide.  He points out that Spotlight teeth-whitening strips — created by Galway dentist sisters Drs Lisa and Vanessa Creaven — are the only European whitening strips that contain the ingredient. The British dental-care market was estimated to be worth £9.6bn (€11.35bn) at the end of 2016, according to market research firm Mintel. There are no figures for the Irish industry.  “Total value of Irish cosmetic dentistry must be in excess of €40m-€50m a year,” says Dr Buckley. Extensive orthodontic work can cost anything between €1,800 and €6,000. Veneers — essentially a fingernail of porcelain laminated to front of teeth — and crowns (like a thimble of porcelain that goes all the way round the tooth) can cost anything from €500 upwards per tooth.  Composite veneers (bonding), using white filling material that’s placed on the tooth to mask irregularities can cost between €150-€250 per tooth. A big number of Seapoint Clinic patients come for implants — a titanium screw placed into the bone replaces a missing tooth. General price for an implant and crown is €1,995, says Dr Flannery. Explaining how price impacts on client profile, Dr Buckley puts it in context: “A porcelain smile makeover is going to cost over €10,000. Rarely can a 30-something afford that — the vast majority of clients are women approaching 50 and over.” At Crotty Orthodontics, about one third of patients are aged 25-40 with another fifth in the 40-50 category. Certainly, says Dr Crotty, there are brides getting pre-wedding work done but mums of the bride are also represented.  “They’re at a point later in life where teeth have begun to drift.”  Dr Crotty cautions against getting work done on just the front visible teeth.  “If you focus in on just improving the appearance of those, you can miss out on other problems. Patients may have gum disease, decayed teeth, or poor bite — if you don’t tackle underlying problems, cracks will re-appear,” he says. A 2015 report from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh stated that the number of complaints involving short-term braces alone has risen by 20% since 2010, with 80%-90% of those claims directed at general dental practitioners rather than specialist orthodontists. Dr Buckley says a smile makeover has to be designed for the particular client. “It’s not like we have a box of smiles that we roll out for everybody.” Like any beauty makeover, it’s not about getting a bling, bling smile — more about getting one that looks a lot like yours, just somewhat enhanced. Specialist dental treatments are also provided by Kinsale Dental and Smiles Dental. Linda gets her smile back When she hit her mid-40s, Carrigaline-based Linda Murphy, now 50 and a mum of three children aged 11 to 17, decided it was time for her to fix her teeth. “They were crooked, off line, over-crowded and I was missing a tooth. They’d been like that from a young age. Finishing the mortgage and after raising the children, I felt it was time. Having a nice smile is important to me. My natural instinct is to smile. When I was younger, I was known as the smiler.” Linda attended Cork Orthodontics, where she had Invisalign on the inside of her front teeth. “That orthodontic work got me to a place where I was able to go for cosmetic work, to go that extra mile and have the smile I wanted.” The extra work included two porcelain veneers (her two front teeth were pitted and cracked) smile balancing and whitening. “I didn’t want a straightened Hollywood smile. I wanted a natural smile but with everything in place and in balance. With the whitening, I didn’t want sparkling white. I got them to a shade I was happy with.” In total, the treatment cost her just over €10,000. “It was a present to myself. I feel great. A lot of people comment on my teeth. When I have my make-up and lipstick on, I think ‘Wow!’.” ‘My voice now is a voice’ Chris Eubank had two implants, a six-unit bridge, two crowns and 18 veneers done by Barry Buckley at Dental Options in Clane. The 50-year-old former professional boxer recalls celebrity Simon Cowell once saying ‘if you’re going to be on TV, you’ve got to have your teeth whitened’. But, for Eubank, getting his teeth fixed was as much about finding his voice as finding his smile.  “During my career, I always had a mind that spoke of humility, consideration, decency, and integrity, yet my voice could never be heard because there was air going through my two middle teeth and that caused a lisp. When your teeth are unattractive, it’s difficult for people to digest what you’re saying.  “It’s so important to have decent teeth. I thought making world champion would give me the respect I’d always yearned for. But, while I was respected as a fighter, no matter what I had to say, however community-focused and decent it was, it wasn’t accepted because of my lisp.  “My voice now is a voice. It’s one that resonates. My words are now digestible. People can’t hear the lisp anymore. After getting my teeth done, it was another level of confidence, not arrogant, a quiet confidence. “Women ask ‘are your teeth yours?’ I say to them: ‘Are your shoes yours, is your handbag yours? Well, these teeth are mine’.” READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS beauty, teeth, cosmetic dentistry © Irish Examiner Ltd.

news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video Space.com Tech This Company Is Poised to Generate Satellite Images of the Entire Earth — Every Day By Irene Klotz, Seeker | February 16, 2017 05:46pm ET MORE Credit: www.planet.com With 88 new shoebox-sized satellites now circling Earth, San Francisco-based Planet will be able to image every piece of land on Earth every day. The latest flock of Planet's Dove satellites blasted off aboard an Indian PSLV rocket Tuesday night. The 88 newcomers expand Planet's constellation to 149 satellites in orbit, not including seven higher-resolution imagers it will acquire as part of its purchase of Terra Bella from Google's parent company, Alphabet. The sale, announced earlier this month, is pending regulatory approval, said Planet chief executive Will Marshall. Why so many satellites? Planet's business plan is to acquire daily imaging of the entire Earth land mass so companies, governments and researchers can better understand the changing planet, Marshall told Seeker. "It's a massive change — a 1,000-fold increase in data rates," he said. RELATED: Indian Rocket Prepares to Launch 104 Satellites at Once The company, founded in 2010 by three former NASA scientists, already has contracts with more than 100 clients, exceeding its expectations for 2016. Once the new satellites are operational in about three months, Planet will be able to offer daily imaging worldwide, a service the company suspects will be in high demand. "It's hard to know exactly. It's a big bet in a way, but we have seen a lot of interest in this data set. We wouldn't have built the constellation if we didn't think there was a huge market," Marshall said. So far, Planet is selling imagery to three main types of customers: agriculture, government and internet companies wanting more up-to-date pictures for consumer maps. "We can tell crop yield on a pixel-by-pixel basis for every farm around the world," Marshall said. The data is being used to precisely manage where and what to grow and when to plant, water, fertilize and harvest crops. RELATED: New Weather Satellite Shows Stunning View of Earth Governments are interested in the images to support services ranging from disaster response to urban planning. Brazil and Mexico buy the data to track deforestation. The company declined to disclose what it cost to build and fly the network. Unlike traditional satellite manufactures, Planet is less interested in how reliable they can make each satellite than in getting as many as possible into orbit. "We put the latest technology on and throw it into space," Marshall said. "We launch more than we need and if one or two fail it isn't the end of the world." Planet is preparing another 48 more Dove spacecraft for launch this summer. WATCH: Did Earth Always Have Water? Originally published on Seeker.

Photo provided i By Roger Van Scyoc rvanscyoc@centredaily.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story STATE COLLEGE When State College broke the Guinness World Record for the number of ice luminaries displayed in a community at once about two weeks ago, Tim Ko had the best view in town. Then, he shared it with everyone else. Using a drone and a 360-degree camera on the ground, Ko, 26, created a panoramic view of the ice lantern extravaganza, racking up his own fair share of notoriety on social media. But with Visionese, his virtual tour startup, Ko has plans that extend beyond the lights of South Allen Street. Instead, he wants to put the spotlight on other businesses and organizations that can make use of the immersive technology. Breaking records is fine, but first he’d like to make it as a young entrepreneur. “This is where marketing and advertising is heading,” he said. “This is the future.” Other companies have taken notice. Facebook acquired virtual reality goggles company Oculus VR for $2 billion about three years ago, while Samsung, Microsoft and Google have all poured additional billions into the VR world, which analysts expect to reach more than $133 billion by 2021. It’s not just tech giants that have gotten on board. Virtual and augmented reality are carving a niche in real estate, auto sales and education — all markets, Ko said, that Visionese can help bring into the future. “For the university, for instance, we have a lot of students who come from out of state,” he said. “Also for international students or for even some in-state students — they can’t come here easily or maybe they don’t want to spend the money to visit the campus. This can help them make their decision when choosing schools.” Or find the bursar’s or registrar’s office when they arrive on campus. Looking at them on a campus map is one thing, Ko said, but seeing the real — or virtual — deal is better. Visionese, which is the only active company in State College to be Google Street View Trusted, has created virtual tours of Penn State’s HUB-Robeson Center and Bald Eagle State Park. In December, the company made its first sale, an interactive walk-through of Little Szechuan, a popular State College restaurant. Within the tour, add-ons within the virtual environment allow users to click for more information. Linked icons for Yelp, OrderUp, Google Maps, a share icon and the restaurant’s website and Facebook page line the left side of the screen. See today’s menu on the wall? Just click it and it expands. It’s like reading the real thing, sans the paper cuts. “Especially for restaurants, we can provide all the information you need without actually being there,” Ko said. Ko, who graduated from Penn State in 2015 with an aerospace engineering degree, left his full-time job in December to pursue Visionese full-time. He made the decision after his company completed the Happy Valley LaunchBox boot camp, an accelerator program for startups. Now, he’s looking toward the future. He’s hoping others view it through the same VR-ready lenses. “I think you learn a lot as an entrepreneur,” he said. “It’s a lot of pressure, but I enjoy it.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Local Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:33 Students hold #NotMyPresident protest at Penn State Pause 6:54 Owen Bonn's fight against cancer 2:02 Heart monitors help Penn State men's hockey improve performance 0:50 Penn State hockey fans throw teddy bears on the ice 2:20 Crews clean up semitruck crash scene 0:37 Snow causes hazardous driving conditions 1:16 Bellefonte Area students run Life Skills Cafe 1:33 People gather to support solidarity in State College 0:44 Men stop someone from burning more American flags 0:27 From guns to garden tools: group repurposes weapons Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 7 hours ago Teacher gets hair cut for Thon 1:04 7 hours ago Teacher gets hair cut for Thon 6:54 16 hours ago Owen Bonn's fight against cancer 2:20 13 days ago Crews clean up semitruck crash scene View more video Local Envisioning the future of marketing, virtual tour startup zooms out Borough Council holds public hearing on proposed high-rise’s application for conditional use Kevin was hospitalized due to a severe injury.

(Horace Langford Jr./Pahrump Valley Times) Reject the push for automatic voter registration Jerry Henkel/Las Vegas Review-Journal Victor Joecks Follow on: Victor Joecks More Columns/Blogs By VICTOR JOECKS LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL If you prefer ignorance on policy issues and politicians, do the rest of us a favor: Don’t vote. For the backers of Initiative Petition 1, ignorance is bliss. They want more people to vote, no matter their interest level. Last year, IP1 supporters collected 125,000 signatures to automatically register to vote anyone who gets a driver’s license or ID card at the Department of Motor Vehicles, unless they opt out in writing. Contrary to the rhetoric of its supporters, IP1 doesn’t make it any more convenient to register to vote. You can already register to vote at DMV. IP1 would only sign up the people who, when currently presented with a chance to register, say no. Voting is an essential part of our democratic republic, and our country needs its citizens to be actively engaged in scrutinizing policies, ideas and politicians. I hope everyone studies these issues — and not just because I want a larger audience for my columns. If you decide, however, that you would rather not read a newspaper, a mailer or Google a candidate, that’s your choice. Just don’t pretend that casting an uninformed ballot does anything more than dilute the votes of those of us who study these issues. We should aspire to get more people to cast informed votes. And IP1 won’t do that. The Legislature has 40 days to make one of three decisions on IP1: ■ It can approve the initiative, which would make it take effect immediately. ■ The Legislature can pass a competing measure and send both to the ballot in 2018. Measures that receive less than 50 percent support would fail. But if both receive majority support, only the measure with most votes takes effect. ■ The Legislature can do nothing, which would allow voters to decide IP1 in 2018. States across the country are considering similar measures. Prominent Democrat politicians, including President Barack Obama, have endorsed the idea. Supporters like to cite Oregon, which was the first state in the country to adopt this system, as proof that it works. Oregon actually shows how unnecessary this is. Oregon registered more than 225,000 voters under its new system, but many would have registered anyway. The real test was how many of those newly registered individuals would vote. Come Election Day, just 43 percent of them voted, compared with 79 percent of traditionally registered voters. That 43 percent included many folks who would have registered under the old system. It’s almost as if people are already intelligent enough to figure out whether they want to register to vote. I encourage every citizen to vote, but if someone doesn’t want to, we should respect their choice. Victor Joecks’ column appears in the Nevada section each Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

February 16, 2017 5:15 PM   Subscribe Like most people here, I'm aghast at what's been happening. Unlike many, I'm not in the US. I am still flailing about for how best to focus my energy. The situation has been consuming me more than I would like, and I think a good part of that is that, though I'm a US citizen and all this is happening to a country I love, I'm not there. So a lot of the outlets that people in the US have to focus their energy don't work for me: - I don't feel like calling congresspeople is effective. Even if I use Skype or Google voice, I have a clearly out-of-area number (or unlisted one) which given their paranoia about non-constituents calling in, I'm convinced they will just screen away as noise. Similarly with sending postcards; it has an Australia address (meaning it would be ignored) and would take weeks to deliver anyway. I can say I'm registered to vote in their region but why would they believe me? I seriously doubt they're looking up that information for everything they receive. - Any local charity or things I can do in person will apply to people in Australia. Which, while good to do, doesn't affect the e.g. people hurt by the immigration ban / lack of social services / other effects of Trump's policies. That is what I am most agonised about and what will make me feel like I'm doing something in some small way to fight back. - I can't march or protest. I mean, I'll be part of a local March for Science here, which will be good, but it (appropriately) won't be about Trump and the Republican administration, and that's what I really want to protest. The only thing it seems I am capable of doing is throwing money at the problem by donating to things like the ACLU or the SPLC. I'm doing some of that, but I'm not made of money, and more to the point it isn't filling the psychological need I have to DO SOMETHING. I need something that involves more than just clicking a few boxes or ranting on Facebook, something that feels like actually doing something. I don't have loads of time but I have some, and I am willing, but I just can't think of anything. Thoughts? posted by forza to Law & Government (11 answers total) 9 users marked this as a favorite   Other advantages I have: I'm a scientist and a good writer, as well as a decent coder (but not fabulous) so I could put together webpages or host files or that sort of thing... but I can't figure out how that would be useful. posted by forza at 5:17 PM on February 16 I do think it makes a difference to donate to the people waging the fight here. I stepped it up for Planned Parenthood and the ACLU and immigrant rights groups already. Also, tweet and, if you are on Facebook, post there. Also, sign online petitions. They can be surprisingly effective. Most of all, stay informed and in the loop about what is being done to fight back. posted by bearwife at 5:21 PM on February 16 You could find an Indivisible group where you are registered to vote (or, really, anywhere) and contact the organizers to see if they could use your help. Some areas that you might be able to help with are: research, creating/updating websites, writing letters to the editor or press releases, and basic organization help. posted by mcduff at 5:35 PM on February 16 I hear you. I'm also an expat, well at least for the next 7 months, and I have actually called my congresspeople, via skype. I did tell them I was a constituent but I don't know if they notice that the number is out of area (Indeed, it would be sort of stupid of them to disregard out of area numbers anyhow, given how many people in the US are cell-phone-only and have a non-local area code). I don't have the time right now so I haven't looked into it, but perhaps you could volunteer to do coding work for a particular organization? As an example, KnockEveryDoor does need volunteers that can't knock doors. Maybe SheShouldRun could use website help? Perhaps sign up for groups local to your voting address in the US, and see what you can do there; the Women's march spawned a bunch of local groups, Indivisible has plenty, and I bet Mefites can list several for you if you tell us what state. They can be a good way to keep tabs on local news, and they might need crisp websites or data processing or whatnot. Another option is Democrats Abroad. Consider going to a meeting if there's one local to you in Aus, and finding out what other people's strategies are. posted by nat at 5:35 PM on February 16 These are good suggestions so far, thanks! FYI, I'm registered to vote in Western Colorado. posted by forza at 5:38 PM on February 16 Oh, another thing I thought of but haven't tried myself, is getting in touch with local refugee programs. It's a global need, and the US failing to carry its weight is burdening everyone else. posted by nat at 5:39 PM on February 16 [1 favorite] Democrats Abroad have been in touch with me; meMail me and I can forward some emails about volunteering. posted by jrobin276 at 5:39 PM on February 16 The folks in Australia that organised the Women's Marches here are doing some follow-up work - the one I'm involved in has a mix of US expats and Australians. MeMail me with your location and I can put you in touch. posted by une_heure_pleine at 5:43 PM on February 16 Yeah, I don't know how plugged into the US expat community you are, but I know of a lot of expats who have banded together to organize. A friend of mine who is in Madrid has organized a local Women's March group of US expats and they had a postcard-writing event recently, the results of which they shipped to America in bulk via courier. Return address means nothing - you are a voting citizen! So I would start with other expats, as mentioned by jrobin276 and une_heure_pleine above. posted by chainsofreedom at 5:49 PM on February 16 Calling your reps actually does do a lot. Many, many people are calling from out of area for all kinds of reasons. Congress has reported a huge swell of calls coming through ever since 45 took office and it hasn't died down. I know it feels futile sometimes but it really really is not. Online petitions are pretty much a waste of time though. posted by bile and syntax at 6:27 PM on February 16 I went to an Indivisible meeting where they said that if you can't phone in, then email. They count the emails. They count phone calls; the more phone calls and emails they get about a subject, the more inclined they are to fight. posted by gt2 at 9:34 PM on February 16 « Older Taylor Negron "Oratorical Contest" Sketch?   |   Inexpensive body wipes that don't smell funny?...

(Photo: Nicholas Kamm, AFP/Getty Images) 13166 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 22 COMMENTEMAILMORE Trump gives a jaw-dropping news conference To say President Trump went off topic during his news conference Thursday is an understatement. Bigly. 'Chaos,' 'mess,' 'fake news,' 'turmoil' are some of his words to rail against the news media, former president Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Islamic State. He claimed he won the biggest electoral victory since Ronald Reagan. (That's not true.) Trump wants to get along with Russia despite the country's aggression, but that may be difficult now. One more thing: Trump had called the news conference to announce his new nominee for Labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, dean of the Florida International University law school. It’s safe to say that news got trumped. More significant announcements that may get less attention: The Trump administration is preparing for the repeal and replacement of Obamacare His administration has already begun work to start construction of a wall along the southern border with Mexico He will issue a new immigration order next week tailored to avoid problems federal judges had with his earlier travel ban. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Donald Trump mounted a vigorous defense of his presidency and accused America's news media of being 'out of control' at a White House news conference Thursday, vowing to bypass the media and take his message 'straight to the people.' Time 'If we stop for one day ...' Many immigrants — legal and undocumented — went on strike Thursday around the country to show how foreign-born workers form the lifeblood of the economy and society. Restaurants were closed. Classrooms were empty. Shops were shuttered. The impact of a "Day Without Immigrants" was visible in numerous cities. "We will all participate so that the government can see how much money they can lose ... if we stop for one day,” said Hector Manny, 33, of Asbury Park, N.J. A few facts: Foreign-born workers make up 47% of the nation's workforce expansion from 2004 through 2014. Immigrants or their children started about 40% of Forbes 500 companies, including Google, Apple and Intel. And they contribute billions in income tax revenue each year.

It might save you a headache. Verizon’s new unlimited data plan sounds great. It’s $80 a month for unlimited talk, text and data. But taxes and fees can typically inflate your bill, and its fine print contains qualifications that deserve a closer look. In response, AT&T has come out with a new unlimited plan that doesn't require a TV subscription. One big catch: It will not allow users to use their phones as a mobile hot spot. Not to be outdone, Sprint is upping its previous offer of five lines with unlimited data for $90 per month until March 31, 2018. But it's only for new customers. T-Mobile, meanwhile, has improved its $70/month unlimited plan ($160 for four lines) with HD video and up to 10GB of "hot spot" data — and that price includes taxes and fees. Remember, a price war means consumers win. "Dear Google Boss" Chloe Bridgewater, a 7-year-old aspiring computer tinkerer, made her first play at a job at Google last week — and it caught the attention of company CEO Sundar Pichai. In a letter starting, “Dear Google Boss,” the girl from Hereford, England, penned the cutest job application. “I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics,” she wrote. “I like computers too and have a tablet I play games on.” It was enough for Pichai to respond with a letter four days later. He told the girl she can accomplish anything, and added, “I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with school!” Chloe Bridgewater's letter to Google.  (Photo: Courtesy of Andy Bridgewater) Tiffany Trump has a new friend, and it’s Whoopi Goldberg While eyes are on Ivanka Trump’s retail line, sister Tiffany has been having fashion moments of her own this week. After hopping between shows at New York Fashion Week, Tiffany found herself with plenty of elbow room at a Philipp Plein show. Cue the controversy. "Nobody wants to sit next to Tiffany Trump at Philipp Plein, so they moved and the seats by her are empty," tweeted one attendee. Tiffany’s peeps pooh-poohed all that, saying the seats were reserved. In either case, enter Whoopi Goldberg. She told her View co-hosts she’d sit there. "Tiffany, I'm supposed to go to a couple more shows," she said. "I don't know what's gonna happen, but I'm coming to sit with you because nobody is talking politics. You're looking at fashion. She doesn't want to talk about her dad." Later that day, Tiffany happily accepted the invite. BFFs.

Gartner's Q4 2016 smartphone sales figures are out, and BlackBerry barely registers a pulse. The once giant Canadian firm's BlackBerry operating system accounted for just 207,900 sales giving them a slightly tragic marketshare that the report rounds down to 0.0%. True, the actual figure is 0.0481%, but that caveat is hardly worth shouting about. To be fair, what is worth shouting about is that the 0.0% figure only refers to smartphones running BlackBerry's own operating system, rather than the modified version of Android favoured by the BlackBerry Priv and the DTEK 60. But while those handsets are lost in the sea of Google's dominance, it's safe to say they remain a drop in that metaphorical ocean. When the company announced it would cease internal handset production in 2016, they had sold just 400,000 handsets that quarter. It's hard to believe that they would have had an uptick in the intervening months. The company's reputation in the smartphone world could still improve, of course. Although BlackBerry itself isn't making handsets anymore, focusing on software instead, TCL Communications has the right to make handsets under the brand name. The first devices will be with us soon, but even if they're a monster runaway success, they'll be fighting Google's corner in the market share battle from now on. Also struggling in the phone fight is Microsoft. Windows Phone has never bobbed higher than the low single digit percentage, and the latest figures show the worst result yet, with just 0.3% of sales in Q4 of 2016. To put that in perspective, that figure was 1.1% in Q4 2015, so a fairly major dent on an already struggling brand.  So good news for fans of duopolies: there's basically only two games in town now: iOS or Android. Android - which is given away free to smartphone developers - has developed an enormous market share of 81.7%, but Apple is doggedly hanging in there with its closed iOS ecosystem maintaining 17.9% of Q4 sales. For anyone thinking that sounds weak, don't worry too much for Apple just yet. When you break down smartphone sales by individual manufacturer in Q4, they're number one, narrowly overtaking nearest rivals Samsung, whom Gartner speculate were hurt by the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco and pressures from the cheaper Chinese handsets that make up the rest of the table.   This article originally appeared at itpro.co.uk Related Articles Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google and more rally against Trump's travel ban Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft join forces to tackle extremist content Google discloses zero-day in Windows kernel Google CEO responds to child's adorable job application Google DeepMind can backstab with the best of them Source: Copyright © ITPro, Dennis Publishing See more about:  blackberry  |  blackberry operating system  |  blackberry priv  |  gartner  |  google  |  handsets  |  market share  |  microsoft  |  running blackberry  |  smartphone sales   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   More in Misc Handhelds (1 of 10 articles) NEWS This device is saving smartphone junkies from themselves << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> More in Misc Handhelds (2 of 10 articles) NEWS Apple is planning to fight proposed 'right to repair' legislation in America << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> More in Misc Handhelds (3 of 10 articles) NEWS Your next smartphone will shoot 1000fps ultra slow-mo videos << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> More in Misc Handhelds (4 of 10 articles) FEATURE How to: Enable private browsing on any iPhone, Android, or Windows device << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> More in Misc Handhelds (5 of 10 articles) NEWS South Korea is strengthening its battery laws to prevent another Note 7 style safety crisis << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> More in Misc Handhelds (6 of 10 articles) NEWS RIP Firefox OS - 2012-2017 << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> More in Misc Handhelds (7 of 10 articles) REVIEW Review: Lenovo Phab2 Pro << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> More in Misc Handhelds (8 of 10 articles) NEWS How Telstra busted the 1Gbit mobile mark with a bit of clever engineering << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> More in Misc Handhelds (9 of 10 articles) REVIEW Review: ExoLens PRO with Optics by ZEISS Wide-Angle Kit << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> More in Misc Handhelds (10 of 10 articles) NEWS This affordable attachment can turn your smartphone into a DNA sequencer << Prev Next >> View all Misc Handhelds articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest in Misc Handhelds News This device is saving smartphone junkies from themselves Review Review: Lenovo Phab2 Pro Feature How to: Enable private browsing on any iPhone, Android, or Windows device Gallery A Tale of Two Styluses From our Partners     See more offers from the PC & Tech Authority Software Store     Sponsored Links Most popular tech stories 7 accounting packages for Australian small businesses compared: including MYOB, QuickBooks Online, Reckon, Xero Mate 9 review: Huawei's long-lasting 5.9in flagship phone Top seven internet security suites of 2017 How long will a UPS keep your computers on if the lights go out?
