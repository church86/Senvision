The expectation and the hope is that Google probably would let bygones be bygones, but the messaging and texting app may not have a foot in the door in just a couple of months. In fact, on December 1, Google will actually remove Hangouts from the core Google Mobile Services package and replace the app with its new video chatting service, Duo. The “gapps” package is what gets pre-loaded from Google on all Android smartphones. The change was announced in an email obtained by Android Police. “Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products,” Google stated. That means that manufacturers can opt to have the app pre-loaded with the rest of the package, but, as David Ruddock points out: There’s also no guarantee that manufacturers will stop bundling the Hangouts app on their devices, but I would strongly assume that’s likely – OEMs and mobile operators want to push their own messaging solutions, or those of partners paying for placement on their devices, and Hangouts was competition. Interestingly, Allo is not required in the GMS package, though it may be more complicated to sell as a chat app than Google’s own barebones, SMS-based Messenger app — yet, it’s also not in gapps. Google claims that Hangouts for Android will still receive support as the product is right now, though we could see more changes that could suit it for business as opposed to general communications.

There’s nothing on the router’s spec sheet that just quite mentions what’s going on with the power adapter, — other than it has a 15W maximum, but the device only consumes 9W — but Leung announced that USB-C connectors are on the adapt. In fact, its configured to the same 5V, 3A spec that Google chose for the Pixel C. “You could just as easily use [the adapter] to charge one of your new Type-C phones,” Leung posted on his Google+ page, “and conversely, use your phone’s 15W power adapter to power Google WiFi.” Source: Google+, Google Via: juggly.cn (Google Translate) Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Because ‘six seconds is more than enough’ Update: DDoS attack on Dyn DNS leaves internet crippled Advertising and Media / Advertising & Marketing / Google Pixel is a physical search bar, according to ad By Staff Reporter on 6 October, 2016 Memeburn Share Google doesn’t do subtle any more. Sure, Google Tricks weren’t exactly marks of elegance, nor are the coy names for its Google Pixel smartphones’ colours. But the company sure knows how to make an advertisement, regardless of how obvious the metaphor is. Published shortly after the Pixels’ launch on 4 October, and airing on US television a few hours after, Google’s new advertisement shows the progression of the company, from a humble internet search engine to the behemoth it is today. Google is evolving to keep its core business fresh, and Google Pixel is evidence of that And the metaphor? A literal shape-shifting search bar. It uses a quite literal search bar, which morphs from a horizontal rectangle, to a more Google Nexus-shaped tablet, and finally, a Google Pixel. It’s quite smart, and does shed light on how the company is fundamentally evolving into a true Microsoft and Apple competitor, without forgetting its real strengths. But before I give the entire ad away, have a look at what Google believes will be the new future of the company in the coming years. Also, if you missed the Google Pixel launch this week, be sure to visit Gearburn for an extensive recap of the event.

But all that is just a bunch of bluster if we can’t see actual results. Soon after Google’s event this week, Phandroid posted over 100 images taken with the search giant’s new Pixel devices. You can see all of them in the gallery above. The Pixel comes with a 12.3-megapixel camera featuring an f/2.0 aperture and 1.55 micron pixels. “Our team of photography gurus and image processing experts have spent the last year designing and tirelessly optimizing our entire camera stack,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai. “Pixel’s camera lets you take stunning photos in low light, bright light or any light,” Pichai added. “Catch action shots as they happen with Smartburst, which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best one. Use Lens Blur to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, making your subject pop. Google’s Pixel also offers manual settings, giving users more control over exposure, white balance, and more. All of this adds up to the best smartphone camera Google has ever made. The images above certainly look impressive but as Phandroid notes a lot of them have been edited using Snapseed and VSCO Cam. We’ll get a better idea of what the pictures straight out of the Pixel when we get our hands on a retail unit later this month.

The more upbeat the music, the more the listener will be motivated to push harder. And now Google is helping to fuel high-intensity workouts by providing the soundtrack to the user's next workout. Google teamed up with the fitness tracking app Runtastic to give Android users workout-inspired playlists that are powered by Play Music. Google Play Music's fitness playlist include a variety of different songs including those that are more than 130 beats per minute, which is the perfect tempo to synchronize with exercise to get the listener's heart rate up, burn calories and work up a sweat. Not only will the playlist keep users pumped since its consists of their favorite songs, but it will also be easier to forget about the burn and get lost in the music. The best part of it is that the Google Play Music ad-free playlists are available for Android users with the Runtastic app for free. While of course this seems to be like a great way to get more users on board Google's music streaming service, Android users don't need to have an account in order to jam along with this partnership. Starting on Friday, Oct. 7, users who launch the Runtastic app can start streaming Google Play Music's fitness playlists that are relevant to their activity. These include "Today's Running Hits" with music from Calvin Harris and Alesso, "Sweaty EDM Workout" with music from Avicii and Armin van Buuren, and "High-Energy Hard Rock" with music from Kings of Leon and The Black Keys. The songs play directly in the Runtastic app so that users can play, pause or skip while keeping track of their workout from one centralized location. This feature could help recruit new users who have Spotify or Apple Music and don't want to keep exiting and launching the two apps and interrupting their workouts. And while the playlists are free for Android users, Google is making sure iOS users don't miss out on what its streaming service has to offer. It announced that it is giving Runtastic users on both Android and iOS devices a free trial to Play Music so that they can stream creating their own playlists to work out to. The ability to stream Google Play Music playlists from Runtastic is now available in more than 60 countries worldwide.

In a world where we rely on nearly 7 billion small screens that’s a tall order--but we’re toasting the first anniversary of AMP with progress the entire initiative can feel good about. From day one, a key focus for AMP has been speed.  Slow loading sites are arguably one of the most frustrating things about the mobile web. Recent Google research shows that 53% of people will leave a site that fails to load in three seconds or less. That’s the worst of all worlds for users, businesses, publishers, websites and the mobile web as a whole. For publishers, who were the first to get on board with AMP, the benefits of fast-loading content are super-tangible. In this case study, the Washington Post reported a 23% increase in mobile search users who return within 7 days. And in this case study, one of Europe’s biggest native advertising platforms, plista, conducted its own experiment among premium publishers like n-tv.de, faz.net, abendzeitung.de, and golem.de to measure AMP’s impact on web app widget speed and profitability. Average click-through rates for publishers improved by 220%, while one saw an increase of 600% after the implementation of AMP. To date the AMP project has been a story about momentum. This is clear in everything from the pace of releases of the open source code to the number of participants embracing the AMP format. From Pinterest to Reddit to Bing and Ebay, reports of success after adopting AMP have rolled in in recent months. At Google, we’re doing our part too. In February, we launched AMP in the “Top Stories” section of Google Search, delivering news in a fast and reliable way. In August, we previewed linking to AMPs across the entire mobile search results page. And this month we’re excited to be rolling out that faster experience to mobile users across Europe. Now when you search on your mobile device, you’ll see a label that indicates a page is AMP’d. This doesn’t change Search results but will show you which sites have pages that are ready to load lightning fast. Today AMP pages load from Google Search in less than one second on average. Beyond just saving time with fast loading pages, AMP also saves data -- AMP pages on Search use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. To date we have over 600 million AMP documents created by sites all over the world (232 locales and 104 languages). These pages cover news content, retail, travel, recipes, general knowledge and entertainment. That’s a lot of fast-loading pages! The open source initiative is thriving because there is a strong community behind it getting involved in everything from working groups to contributing to the Github page with suggestions, feedback and code spec. While the first year of the AMP Project has gotten off to a good start, there still remains a lot of work ahead.  This roadmap is a good way to stay up to date on what is happening next. We look forward to returning in a year’s time with even more awesome progress as we work together to make the web great for everyone.

By Chris Barraclough 7th Oct 2016 Features Sony Xperia X Series Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones Tweet We compare the new 'made by Google' Pixel phone, with Sony's 2016 flagship mobile the Xperia XZ. What's the difference in terms of specs, camera tech and other features, and which one is best for you? Here's our Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ comparison review. Just this week, Google pulled back the curtain on its 5-inch flagship Pixel phone, packing premium specs for a super-premium price. The Pixel boasts a sharp and colourful Full HD screen, the latest Snapdragon processor and a powerful 12-megapixel camera, but it's also just as expensive as other flagship phones like Apple's iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7. So how does the Pixel compare with Sony's Xperia XZ, another super-powered Android handset that just hit the UK last month? Here's our full Pixel vs Xperia XZ comparison review to help you decide. And have a gander at our full hands-on review of the 5-inch Pixel phone, to learn more. Check out our hands-on Pixel XL review too, where we share our first thoughts on the super-sized 5.5-inch version of the Pixel phone. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Specs at a glance Phone Google Pixel Sony Xperia XZ Screen size 5-inches 5.2-inches Screen resolution Full HD 1920x1080 Full HD 1920x1080 Weight 143g 161g Fingerprint sensor? Yes Yes Water resistant? No Yes OS Android 7.1 Nougat Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow Processor Snapdragon 821 Snapdragon 820 Memory 4GB 4GB Storage 32/128GB 32/64GB MicroSD? No Yes Battery 2770mAh 2900mAh Rear camera 12-megapixel 23-megapixel Front camera 8-megapixel 13-megapixel Price From £599 From £500 Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Design Sony's Xperia XZ is a proper hand-filler, although just about usable one-handed. Those rounded edges makes it quite comfortable to hold, while the matte metallic surfacing gives an attractive finish in a selection of shades. It's not impervious to scratches sadly, although these are difficult to see unless the light catches the phone just right. Google's Pixel phone is more compact and a little lighter too, with a slender design that's well suited to one-handed use. Around the back you'll find an unusual blend of glass and metal, which certainly stands out from the rest of the smartphone crowd. It feels quite hardy but we'll be testing that out when we use the Pixel phone as our full-time handset. The Pixel phone isn't water resistant, unlike the Xperia XZ, so you probably shouldn't check your Twitter feed in the bath or anything. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Screen and media Both the Pixel phone and the HTC 10 sport a sharp Full HD screen, which means you'll struggle to make out individual pixels. With either handset you get rich colours that really pop and bring images to life. And both phones will be easy to use in harsh sunlight, thanks to those powerful brightness levels. Sony's Xperia XZ also supports Hi-Res audio when your plug in headphones, for a super-detailed musical experience. In our brief play, the Pixel phone didn't seem to offer the same support. The Pixel phone also doesn't have a microSD memory card slot so you can't expand the on-board storage. Although there is a 128GB model, if you've got £699 hanging around in your wallet. Thankfully the XZ does support microSD, so you can fill up a massive card with loads of movies and more. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: OS and features Sony's Xperia XZ still uses Android Marshmallow, which was released last year, just like every other flagship Android from 2016. But the Pixel phone comes with the latest Android Nougat pre-installed - no surprise, as this is a 'made by Google' mobile. This gives you Google's new Assistant AI straight out of the box, which is basically a step beyond Google Now with its context-aware helpfulness. Of course, the Xperia XZ should get an update to full Nougat soon, but you won't get the Assistant feature because Google is saving that for Pixel handsets alone. Bums. The good news for gamers is that the Xperia XZ does support Remote Play, which means you can stream your PS4 gaming sessions straight to your phone. You can even pair your PS4 controller, with zero latency to spoil the show. Both phones pack a fingerprint sensor, to quickly and securely unlock to your desktops. On the Xperia XZ this is mounted on the edge, while the Pixel phone's is stuck around the back. Both are easy and intuitive to use. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Performance and battery life Gamers and media fans will enjoy a smooth everyday performance from the Xperia XZ, thanks to the Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM stuffed inside. We're not expecting to see any sign of slowdown any time soon. That said, the new Pixel phone uses the latest Snapdragon 821 processor, which promises a ten percent increase in performance over the old 820 chipset. In terms of real-life experience, there's unlikely to be any real difference between these two mobiles, at least for some time - but in a year or two, the Pixel may be the smoother operator of these two. As for battery life, the Xperia XZ gives you at least a day of heavy use per charge. And of course it supports fast charging, to get you powered up and ready to rock in no time at all. We're yet to test the Pixel phone's battery life, but early word is that the Pixel can keep going for even longer. Fast charging is again supported, while both handsets use Type-C USB for power and data transfer. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Cameras When we get our review sample of the Pixel phone we'll be thoroughly testing the 12-megapixel rear camera, but in our hands-on tests it certainly seems to be a worthy flagship snapper. You can take rapid-fire shots and there's zero shutter lag, just like on the iPhone 7's excellent camera. Just tap and your photo takes instantly. Our test photos were pleasingly detailed, although unlikely to beat the Xperia XZ's output. Sony's 23-megapixel camera really impresses with its sharp, attractive images, and the XZ's new triple-sensor tech works well in low-light conditions. Check out our in-depth Xperia XZ camera review for full samples and more. Both of these phones can capture up to 4K resolution video, with strong image stabilisation to cut down on shakes and judders. If you shoot a lot of home movies, you don't need to lean towards one phone or the other. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Price and verdict When it comes to cost, the Xperia XZ and Google Pixel phone both pack a premium price. However, it's possible to pick up the Xperia XZ on contract for less cash than the Pixel, and in terms of specs and features there's not a massive gap between them. You can grab the Sony Xperia XZ from O2, from £37 per month with no up-front cost. Check out our round-up of the best Pixel phone UK deals. Stay tuned for our full Google Pixel phone review.

Home News Apps Hangouts demoted in Google Apps package, Duo gets nod Hangouts won't be mandatory on Google partner phones soon, Duo will be By: Sean Ridgeley | Apps News | Posted: Oct 7, 2016 11:26 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Google recent sent out an e-mail to its Mobile Services partners indicating Hangouts will no longer be required to be bundled with hardware. Rather, video calling app Duo will take its place.     "Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products," it reads. "This change will take effect on December 1, 2016."   What's also interesting is Google's text messaging app Allo isn't getting the nod alongside Duo; for whatever reason, the company is content to not push the text side of their new communication apps in this regard, at least for the time being.   In any case, Google will continue to support Hangouts; it simply won't be mandatory anymore on partner hardware.

The Internet giant has had stores inside stores. But it does not — at least not yet — have the equivalent of Apple stores. But the introduction of a high-end line of hardware marks a new era for the Internet giant and there's the hint that a more ambitious brick-and-mortar retail strategy may be in the making. Google is in the midst of a new and very aggressive push to sell its own consumer electronic devices, rather than supplying the software to manufacturers. © Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY Google's new consumer electronics devices will be displayed in a pop-up shop in New York City on Oct. 20. Pop-up shops are a common prelude to establishing a bigger retail presence. That's what Microsoft did with Xbox and Surface and Samsung has also done pop-ups for the holidays. "It seems inevitable that they need some kind of hardware presence to show this stuff off in a consistent and joined-up way," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research. The challenge? Opening retail outlets is a costly and time-consuming endeavor if Google wants to reach a significant chunk of the U.S. population, Dawson said. "Look at Apple – it launched its first stores 15 years ago, has been ramping up steadily since, and still has under 300 US stores. Microsoft is an even more relevant and a more recent example," he said. "If you’re willing to sacrifice some of the premium in the retail experience, you can roll out more quickly – Microsoft has around 100 US stores. But Microsoft can show off both its own devices and third party devices – I’m not sure Google could reasonably do the same in its retail stores." Among the Google devices that will be on display: the new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, virtual reality headset Daydream View, Google Home smart speaker and Google WiFi.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (21) Post your comment Google Duo will replace Hangouts as a mandatory preinstalled app on Android phones 07 October 2016 Android itself may be open source and ready for any mobile device maker to use, but the Google apps are a whole different story. If you want the Play Store on the phones you make, then you need to play ball with Google - and, among other things, agree to preinstall a certain list of apps. This changes from time to time, and come December 1 it will change once more. From that point on, Google Duo will become a mandatory preinstall for Android phones, replacing Hangouts in that role. Hangouts will be an optional preinstall, meaning some manufacturers may choose to ship it with their devices, but most probably won't. On the other hand, this means Duo will come preinstalled on every single Android handset released after December 1. So those market share gains it's made already are only going to get bigger. Obviously this doesn't mean Hangouts is dead per se, but unbundling it from the mandatory Google apps package is yet another step in the search giant's strategy of making this a business communications platform of sorts - and not a consumer-oriented product. When it comes to messaging, that role now goes to Allo, Google's umpteenth effort in this space, and yet another try at competing with Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger. Oddly though, Allo is not part of the aforementioned Google apps list, at least not yet.

By Regina F. Graham For Dailymail.com Published: 18:49 EST, 7 October 2016 | Updated: 07:20 EST, 8 October 2016 e-mail 3.5k shares 490 View comments WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange promised 'significant' disclosures on subjects including the U.S. election and Google in the coming weeks as the secret-spilling group marked its 10th anniversary on Tuesday. Assange said WikiLeaks plans to start publishing new material starting this week, but wouldn't specify the timing and subject and warned that the so called 'October Surprise' may expose Google. The war between Assange and the tech giant started in 2014 when he wrote about the company in his book titled, 'When Google Met Wikileaks', according to Recode. 'Nobody wants to acknowledge that Google has grown big and bad,' Assange wrote in the book.  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (pictured in 2016) promised 'significant' disclosures on subjects including the U.S. election and Google in the coming weeks as the secret-spilling group marked its 10th anniversary on Tuesda Assange (pictured above on Tuesday) said WikiLeaks plans to start publishing new material starting this week 'But it has. Schmidt's tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation.'  Assange became concerned about former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's ties with the State Department in 2009 when Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of state. He has claimed that Schmidt, who is a chairman at the company, has worked with the Clintons for years, as Donald Trump accused Google of political bias saying that it suppresses negative news about Clinton.   Speaking by video link to an anniversary news conference in Berlin earlier this week, he said the leaks include 'significant material' on war, arms, oil, internet giant Google, the U.S. election and mass surveillance. WikiLeaks hopes 'to be publishing every week for the next 10 weeks,' Assange said. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next BREAKING NEWS: Vladimir Putin publicly accused by U.S....

Share this article Share Assange wrote in his 2014 book that 'Schmidt's (file above) tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation' The group, which released Democratic National Committee emails days before the party's national convention earlier this year, wouldn't say who or what campaign would be affected by the upcoming U.S. election leaks.  Assange said speculation that he or WikiLeaks intend to harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is 'false.' Asked whether he feels any personal affinity with Clinton's Republican rival, Donald Trump, Assange replied: 'I feel personal affinity really, I think, with all human beings.' 'I certainly feel sorry for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,' he added. 'These are two people that are tormented by their ambitions in different ways.' Assange claimed that Schmidt has worked with the Clintons for years, as Donald Trump accused Google (file) of political bias saying that it suppresses negative news about Clinton  Wikileaks came to prominence a decade ago by publishing classified documents that related to prisoners in the United States' Guantanamo Bay, NSA surveillance of world leaders and military operations in Afghanistan.  In addition, millions of diplomatic and military files were made public by Wikileaks from US soldier Chelsea Manning who is currently serving a 35-year prison term for leaking the information.  Sweden is seeking Assange's extradition in a rape investigation.  He hasn't left the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012.  Assange denies the rape allegation and says he fears being extradited to the U.S. to face espionage charges if he leaves.

Turns out that was partially true. As of the 1st of December, Google will no longer require Hangouts to be preinstalled on Android phones. This is according to an email sent to the company’s Mobile Services partners, in which Google made a change to the core GMS package. “Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016.” In case you did not know, Google usually requires OEMs to bundle a suite of Google apps/services if they want to use Android on their phones. For a while now Hangouts was one of the default apps but like the email reads, Hangouts will no longer be a required app and will be replaced by Duo. This doesn’t mean that Hangouts is dead. OEMs still have the option of bundling Hangouts if they want, but they are just no longer required to. Interestingly enough we had always assumed that if anything, Allo would be a more suitable replacement for Hangouts, not Duo. n the meantime Google is expected to focus Hangouts on its business users.

For one, Nexus devices had little visibility in their absence at relevant carrier stores around the globe, but other forms of ads were never really pushed either. Chances are you’ve never seen a giant Nexus billboard on the road, and it would be hard for you to remember an ad box inside of a newspaper. But nobody, starting with Google, ever expected that to happen, either; Nexus phones were not meant to be iPhone or Galaxy S rivals, if not on the spec sheet and quality-wise. Pixel, however, is a rather different story. A story that is ostensibly starting just now, as both the two Chromebook Pixels and the Pixel C haven’t enjoyed the limelight too much either. We actually started seeing this before the Pixel and Pixel XL were even a thing; Google flexed its advertising muscle to let people know that… it was hosting an event. It is something very few other companies do, like Apple or Samsung with its usual “#TheNextGalaxy” campaign. And, now that the gates have been opened, Google is doubling down on what is arguably its flagship product. I am lucky enough to live in London, and given that the UK has been selected among the first markets where Google will sell its devices, I’m already seeing this commitment imprinted in the environment around me. And what struck me is not just the seeming ubiquity of these ads, but the actual kind of places I saw them. Save for the usual carrier store, I saw the Pixel advertised on massive billboards, the front page of the free newspaper handed out to hundreds and hundreds of people at the entrance of every London Underground station, and even in the massive area opposed to the trains’ platform — a spot usually destined to the iPhone. We also know that Google is planning to open a pop-up store in New York City come October 20th, and that will run through the holidays. Also, as per a Reuters report, the whole advertising campaign for television will start with a massive $3.2M spending, with more to come. Even Mario Queiroz, Google’s Vice President of Product Management, told Reuters that it was a “very significant marketing campaign”, also alluding at potential million-dollar-worth ads to show during the Thanksgiving football games. This is certainly a noteworthy shift in Google’s strategy, and a clear reflection of Rick Osterloh’s words at this week’s past event: Google is serious about hardware and the whole “Made by Google” thing, which is definitely not a one-off shot; they are in it ‘for the long run’. Take a look at a few shots down below. This is Old Street, where this massive four-faced billboard only shows Google-related stuff. As of now, the four screens are entirely dedicated to the Pixel. This is a “standard” ad outside one of EE’s store. This is Oxford Street, however, where literally thousands of people walk by every day. Front page of The Evening Standard, a free newspaper you can find at each of the tube’s stops. Part one of a massive ad inside of Bond Street’s station — a pretty crowded one, I assure you. Part 2.

When it was first unveiled back at Google I/O this year we were curious to see what Google plans to do in the space. Check out our brief hands-on with the device to see our initial impressions. At launch, the device will have support for several music services and other apps. Google finally released a full list of supported apps at launch. While there’s no public API for Google Home for developers to tie app support yet hopefully, it’s something Google will consider releasing in the future.

Duo, Google’s new video chat app, will take the place of Hangouts. As a result, Duo will come pre-installed on every single new Android smartphone released in 2017 and beyond. It’s important to note this does not mean Google is preparing to shut down Hangouts — though the company has already noted it plans to remake Hangouts into a business-to-business offering. Moreover, OEMs can continue to pre-install Hangouts should they choose to do so. Hangouts will also continue to be available on the Google Play Store. That said, it’s still a telling move on the part of Google. While Hangouts may have its fans, the company is now clearly more concerned with the success of Allo, its new AI assisted chat app, and Duo. On that note, Google has not added Allo to the list of required GMS apps, though it’s likely that move is forthcoming. SourceAndroid Police Roger I like Hangout because I can use it from my Gmail of Inbox page. I hope they’ll find a way to integrate Allo in a similar fashion when/if they shut down Hangouts for personal use. Shawn I am surprised they didn’t add Allo also with Dou immediately. Something must have been uncertain when the paperwork was being drawn up. John W Allo is still in testing Shawn Why do you think this? Was this stated somewhere? John W Hmm i read that somewhere that it was widely available now but not final yet. Shawn I sideloaded Allo when it came out. I saw someone say something that made me wonder if my version was up to date or not. When I looked at the version number I noticed it listed the version number as “1.0.006_RC18.” Part of me sees Release Candidate 18 and it makes me wonder if this is confirmation of what you were saying. The other part of me thinks that RC18 was the one that was selected, and they simply didn’t remove the RC designator because that would be changing the file. southerndinner Until Duo properly supports multiple devices at the same time like virtually all of its competition, I have absolutely no interest in it. fred Bad decision. Hangouts works just fine. Better than Duo. Ipse Voice calls to phone numbers….anyone? This goes the way of the Dodo bird and Google Voice. Maybe Google can ASK users what THEY want…. Brad Fortin “As a result, Duo will come pre-installed on every single new Android smartphone released in 2017 and beyond.” … or until Google releases *another* new messaging platform. Probably at the next I/O. Can’t Fix Stupid Googles Apps and Android strategies are an inconsistent mess. Google Now for photos…nope it’s now over in Google photos. Project Aura…nope shelved. Allo, Duo…hangouts? Who knows. Nexus gone. Pixel? How about some Apple prices.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:55 AM, October 8, 2016 Google's new "Pixel" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics<005930.KS> and Apple Inc <AAPL.O>. Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's<GOOGL.O> Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N>, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

Google this week said that substantial progress has been made with the open-source Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) initiative in the one year since it launched last October. The AMP project is a Google-led effort to enable a faster mobile web. Under the effort, the company is trying to get website owners to implement the AMP protocol for creating lightweight web pages for mobile devices. The project is part of a Digital News Initiative that Google launched last year for publishers in Europe but is now being applied on a broader scale. Publishers who were the first to get on AMP have seen substantial benefits from having fast-loading mobile content, David Besbris, Google's vice president of search and AMP, wrote on the company's Europe blog. As one example, Besbris pointed to the Washington Post, which after implementing AMP has seen a 23 percent increase in mobile users who return within one week. The Post currently publishes more than 1,000 AMP-enabled articles each day, and nearly 55 percent of online traffic comes from mobile users. Since implementing AMP, page load times are 88 percent faster than they were with its previous mobile website, the Post claimed in a case study posted on the AMP project website. Average page load times are now just 400 milliseconds, the Post said. The boost in page load times from AMP has benefited publishers in other ways as well, Besbris said. A study conducted by Plista, one of Europe's largest advertising platforms, showed that average click-through rate for publishers jumped a whopping 220 percent for sites that had implemented AMP, he said. "To date the AMP project has been a story about momentum," Besbris said. In addition to more websites implementing the protocol, the pace of code releases for the open-source protocol has also kept growing, he said. In the one year since the AMP project launched, website owners around the world have created over 600 million AMP documents in 104 languages. In addition to publishers, other sites such as retail, travel and recipe websites have implementing the protocol, he said. For its part, Google has been trying to encourage adoption of AMP by highlighting pages that have been enabled for the protocol in mobile search, Besbris said. Now when users search for content using their smartphones or tablets, they will see an AMP icon to indicate pages that will load faster on their devices. For the moment at least, Google has said that AMP will not have a direct impact on how it ranks mobile search engine results. But going forward, the company has indicated that it will favor websites and web pages that have been optimized for the mobile web over sites that have not. In addition to highlighting search results, Google has also launched AMP-enabled stories in the "Top Stories" portion in Google Search on mobile. Google has cast AMP largely as an effort that will benefit internet users, publishers and website owners in general. But the company also has a lot to gain from enabling a faster web experience for mobile users. As a company that derives almost all of its revenues and profits from online advertising, Google stands to profit from having web pages—and the ads that go along with those pages—load faster on mobile devices. Google's own research shows that 53 percent of users will abandon a site or web page if it fails to load within 3 seconds.           LATEST ENTERPRISE APPS ARTICLES   Windows 10 Sticky Notes Grow More Insightful in More Languages Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters IBM Launches Project Intu for Embodied Cognition Microsoft Releases First SharePoint Server Feature Pack Google to Shelve Free Map Maker Tool                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) (Eric Risberg) Print Email Wilborn P. Nobles III, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Wilborn P. Nobles III, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 07, 2016 at 3:45 PM comments A car crash involving one of Google's driverless cars landed its test driver in the hospital in September, according to a report from Quartz.com. In Google's monthly self-driving car report released Thursday (Oct. 6), the Internet search giant said another vehicle ran a red light and slammed into the right side of its Lexus SUV on Sept. 23. The driverless car was moving through a green light when it "detected another vehicle traveling" at 30 mph, according to the report. Google's car applied the brakes "in anticipation that the other vehicle would run through the red light," but the report added that the driver then took manual control of the car.  The report does not address if the test driver made the right call, but the website said the phrasing of the report suggests the driver interfered with the car's ability to avoid a crash. Although the report said no injuries were reported, the driver later "voluntarily went to a local hospital" where he was later released. The report from Google comes as companies begin to put driverless technology on the road despite safety concerns among critics and federal regulators alike. In February, Google admitted fault when one of its driverless cars collided with a bus in California. Google currently has 58 driverless vehicles operating in four different states, in which they have driven more than 2 million miles.

The company is on track to reach 45 metros total by the end of 2016. By Conner Forrest | October 7, 2016, 12:33 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/solarseven AT&T will bring its gigabit internet service to 11 more metro areas in the US, the company announced on Tuesday. According to a press release, the expansion is part of a newly-created umbrella brand called AT&T Fiber, which will explore new technologies for internet connectivity. "Customer demand for high-speed connectivity is exceeding even our high expectations. Today we're also introducing the AT&T Fiber umbrella brand, which lets us bring ultra-fast internet to even more residential and business customers through a mix of the latest network technologies," David Christopher, CMO of the AT&T Entertainment Group, said in the press release. Under the new AT&T Fiber brand, AT&T GigaPower will be rebranded as AT&T Internet 1000. Currently, AT&T offers fiber internet service in 29 US metro areas. The additional 11 will bring the total number to 40, but AT&T said in the press release that they are targeting deployment in 45 total metro areas by the end of 2016. They also said they are planning to hit at least 67 in total sometime in the future. SEE: Google's Fiber lottery: Predicting who's next and how Google picks winners To see what metro areas are available now, and which areas AT&T currently has underway, check out this map. In terms of the recent expansion, AT&T is targeting the following 11 areas: Florida: Gainesville and Panama City Georgia: Columbus Kentucky: Central Kentucky Louisiana: Lafayette Mississippi: Biloxi-Gulfport and Northeast Mississippi North Carolina: Wilmington Tennessee: Southeastern Tennessee and Knoxville Texas: Corpus Christi AT&T said in its press release that it had planned to be in 12.5 million total locations by mid-2019, but if development continues at its current rate, then those plans could be surpassed. AT&T also said that it has connected more than 1 million "incremental business customer locations" to fiber as well. More about Networking Gartner's 10 big trends that will change how IT operates How to deploy a Samba domain controller in under 10 minutes Real-world server room nightmares Subscribe to TechRepublic's Data Center Trends newsletter Along with Verizon Fios and Google Fiber, AT&T is one of the biggest competitors in the fiber internet market. However, Verizon Fios claims coverage in only 12 US cities, and while Google Fiber had expanded rapidly for a while, it was recently reported that the company was cutting jobs amid poor adoption rates. However, there is another reason why AT&T is aggressively expanding its fiber network—it was ordered to do so by the government. When AT&T purchased DirecTV back in the summer of 2015, the FCC set requirements that AT&T had to build out a fiber network to provide high-speed internet connection to at least 12.5 million people within four years. The idea was that it would increase competition among internet providers and (assumedly) would make it easier for cord cutters in areas where AT&T and DirecTV would no longer be competing. Regardless of the motivations behind it, AT&T is on track to become the largest fiber internet provider in the US. And, if the market matures and adoption increases, AT&T will be in a strong position as one of the top providers in the country. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers AT&T will be expanding its fiber internet services into 11 more metro areas in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. AT&T is quickly growing past its biggest competitors, Verizon and Google, and could end up as the top provider for fiber internet. The reason AT&T is targeting so many regions is to fulfill requirement set by the FCC during its purchase of DirecTV in 2015.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel XL’s Geekbench performance scores not as impressive By R Padla - October 7, 2016 5 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We’re very much looking forward to reading reviews about the new Pixel and Pixel XL. These new phones from Google is the first pair of smartphones without the Nexus tag. Manufactured by HTC, the two Pixels are expected to impress the mobile industry. But right now, we don’t have reports and figures to show you except for the scores of a recent Geekbench performance test. The numbers of the Google Pixel XL for both single-core test and multi-core test hit 1648 and 4121, respectively. This may be an early benchmark and analysis but the numbers are disappointing because the Pixel XL is already equipped with a Snapdragon 821. It’s expected to perform better than the Snapdragon 820. The latter is found in most of the latest premium phones available in the market today like the Galaxy Note 7, Galaxy S7/S7 edge, LG G5, HTC 10, and OnePlus 3 among others. As for the Pixel XL, it’s the first-ever S821-powered smartphone to be released in the US. There’s that expectation of better performance but unfortunately, the Google Pixel XL with Snapdragon 821 didn’t show a significant improvement. Scores are still high though but close or similar to the Qualcomm S820-equipped phones. We’re not sure how different or better the Snapdragon 821 should be but we were at least expecting longer battery life, faster browsing, and the phone not heating up quickly. The scores aren’t always good indicators because calculations may differ every time. We’re still looking forward to more test, analyses, tear downs, and reviews before we can say if the Pixel series is worth our attention or not.

Read More . Many consumers don’t get their money back. Fortunately, you can get reimbursed for all manner of mishaps — even for out-of-warranty devices. However, refunds may require a credit card, documentation, and persistence. Let’s start with a hypothetical scenario: you purchased a device, and it breaks. What should you do? Your course of action depends on when you bought the device, whether you used a credit card, and what kind of credit card you own. Some cards can get even smashed or stolen items refunded. On top of that, almost all credit cards offer extended warranties that can get your money back well after the warranty ends. When Did the Device Break or Go Missing? Within 30 days of purchase? Most retailers take returns if the device breaks within 30 days (sometimes less). Between 31 and 90 days after purchase on a credit card? Those with lost, broken, or stolen devices may need to rely on a credit card company. Within the warranty period? If the device breaks inside of the manufacturer’s warranty period, return it to the manufacturer. The device broke a year after the warranty ended? File a claim with your credit card company. Did the Device Fail Within 30 Days? If your device fails within 30 days, return the device to the retailer. Most retailers offer no-hassle returns, provided the customer brings the product back within the return period. The return period differs depending on the retailer. Here are a few electronics dealers and their policies: Newegg’s return policy depends on the component. Computer motherboards aren’t returnable, for example. The standard return period is 30 days. Amazon’s return policy is a standard 30 days. eBay’s unofficial return policy is 30 days, although most fall somewhere around 14 days. Best Buy’s standard return policy offers a 15-day window, although they also handle warranty returns. Apple’s return policy is 14 days. Even worst-case scenarios are salvageable. If the seller refuses to provide a refund on defective merchandise, you can contact your credit card issuer and initiate a credit card chargeback. A chargeback forcibly refunds money from the fraudulent seller to the buyer. Ads by Google However, I caution against using chargebacks as the first line of defense against scams. It’s better used as a last resort. Credit card companies take chargebacks very seriously, and abuse can lead to legal trouble. However, if the device gets stolen or broken through misuse, the return period gets invalidated. Fortunately, if you used a particular type of credit card, there’s an additional degree of protection called purchase protection, which covers up to 90 days after the sale. The Device Breaks or Is Lost Within 90 Days The manufacturer’s warranty only covers defective devices — usually within a year from the day of purchase. This protection doesn’t extend to accidental damage or theft. Fortunately, a few credit cards include an insurance policy known as Purchase Protection or Purchase Assurance. The exact terminology depends on the credit group. Purchase protection gets buyers their money back in case of accident, theft, or acts of God. There are a lot of variations in how claims get processed but, in general, you need the following documentation: Original receipt (electronic copies also work); Original warranty card or documentation (sometimes required); The credit card used to make the purchase; Account statement showing the purchase; And a police report, if stolen. I tested Chase’s Purchase Protection, and the process is identical to filing an insurance claim. Card holders need to call their card provider and speak with its benefits division. The card holder must then request to activate Purchase Protection. At this point, filing a claim can be done either electronically or via snail mail. During this process, a claims inspector must validate your paperwork and documentation, which can take months. If successful, the credit company remits all, or part, of the money. Here’s the email that I received after filing the claim via telephone: I just printed and filled out the requisite paperwork, attached it to the form included with the email, and mailed it out. The Device Breaks Within the Warranty Period If the gadget breaks within the manufacturer’s warranty period, first contact the manufacturer. (We recommend using GetHuman.) However, sometimes the manufacturer doesn’t answer emails or calls. In this case, two courses of action can help get your money back: invoke the extended warranty or escalate the conflict. Use Your Credit Card’s Extended Warranty Credit companies — almost universally — bundle extended warranties with their cards. A credit card company’s extended warranty adds one to two years to the original manufacturer’s warranty. Replacement policies vary by credit group. For example, Cardhub’s analysis indicates that American Express provides — by a large margin — the best extended warranty service out of the four credit groups. You need the following documentation to invoke the card’s extended warranty: Original receipt (electronic copies aren’t accepted); Original warranty card or documentation; The credit card used to make the purchase; Account statement showing the purchase. The terms of the extended warranty vary by individual credit groups. For example, Visa Signature cards (but not all Visa cards) extend the warranty by a whopping two years. Both CardHub and Nerdwallet, on the other hand, regard American Express as the overall best credit group for extended warranties. Escalate the Conflict When a device breaks within the warranty period — and you aren’t responsible — contact the manufacturer. Unfortunately, that means dealing with customer service. Again, we recommend using the website GetHuman. Returning a defective device requires a return merchandise authorization (RMA). Getting an RMA requires some patience, for several reasons. First, dealing with customer support may entail escalation. If customer support cannot equitably resolve your case, you must speak with a higher support tier. For example, if a technician concludes that your laptop works fine, you must ask to speak with a supervisor. If the supervisor cannot resolve the issue, you must speak to the supervisor’s superior. Unfortunately, delinquent manufacturers won’t honor warranties. If you didn’t use a credit card to purchase the device, you might need to complain through social media Are You Getting The Most Out Of Your Customer Service Experience? Are You Getting The Most Out Of Your Customer Service Experience? Have you ever called customer service, only to end the call frustrated, disappointed and without resolution? Or perhaps there was a resolution, but it was unfavorable and certainly not worth the time you spent on... Read More . Here’s an example of a complaint lodged on Twitter: The battery on my phone is being super weird. Was just charged to 100%, two minutes later it’s at 94% @SamsungMobileUS — Kini (@kinilei1) September 28, 2016 Samsung responded immediately: @kinilei1 Hello and apologies for the delay. We saw your post and we’d like to help. How long have you been havin… https://t.co/Oi84Obxw9V — Samsung Support USA (@SamsungSupport) September 28, 2016 As you can see, social media gets results, and it gets them fast. Unfortunately, if your device fails outside the warranty period, contacting customer service may not help. The Device Fails After Two Years If the device fails outside of the warranty, your options narrow. While a credit card’s extended warranty can run up to two years past the manufacturer’s warranty, in most cases, two years spells the end of a potential refund.

What’s the Moral of the Story? I strongly recommend that consumers use a credit card to purchase high-value electronics. While you might not care if a $5 set of earplugs break, a $700 laptop purchase requires an extra degree of caution.

Close share panel × There are three main issues the UK needs to address if it is going to build a technology company on the scale of Google, according to a group of entrepreneurs. For the BBC's recent Tech Talent week we asked why the UK can't build a company on the scale of Google. Media captionAlex Depledge chairs the Coalition for a Digital Economy (COADEC) Each day we did a video profile of someone with a stake in the UK tech economy, to get their perspective on the issue. Our guests were established technology entrepreneurs Alex Depledge and Herman Narula; aspiring start-up founders Ben Stanway and David Kramaley; and start-up mentor Stefano Tresca. Each person made his or her contribution separately. Nonetheless, three common ideas emerged for plotting a route to UK tech success. Big breakthrough role models Success breeds success. You knew this already. But had you considered this can be both psychological and practical? Ben Stanway, in his twenties, has just started his entrepreneurial journey with his app Moneybox, which is barely a month old in the App Store. It allows you simultaneously to track your personal finances and to invest. He admitted to craving psychological inspiration from entrepreneurial role models in the UK. Media captionNew founder Ben Stanway craves role models "This is a very important thing," he explained. The more role models there are, the better it is for the whole ecosystem. So it's great to see companies such as TransferWise and Deliveroo succeed globally." For Herman Narula, founder and chief executive of virtual reality company Improbable, these success stories also need to fire up the imagination. "We need to be comfortable with the idea of setting up a company to find something mind-blowingly important, like electric cars or space travel. We need a single, breakout success." Indeed UK entrepreneurs with "megalomaniac" ambitions are what we need, according to Stefano Tresca. He is in close contact with the start-up community, as co-founder of Level 39, an incubator initiative in London. American entrepreneurs have a natural desire to become the biggest company in the world, he said. "It's not that European entrepreneurs are lazy, but if you aim the bar low, it's very hard to build something big." "Europeans love to cash out and sell their company, live the good life, and that includes me," he admitted. Media captionStefano Tresca talks about ambition and investors in the UK However, success when it comes will bring very practical advantages to everyone, explained entrepreneur Alex Depledge. "We don't really have that many people in the UK or even Europe who have captained or been a part of an early stage company as it scales up rapidly." She sold her online business for booking domestic cleaners, Hassle, to a German company after three years for £24m. Looking back, she feels a shallow talent pool held back growth. "It's like the blind leading the blind." Digital Europe For Alex Depledge and fellow seasoned entrepreneur Herman Narula, the issue of Brexit weighed heavily on their minds. What they feared most was losing access to something that is still emerging: the European Digital Single Market. This is an initiative by the European Commission to harmonise rules for doing digital business in Europe. It was launched by Jean-Claude Juncker in May last year and covers everything from copyright and data protection to digital business regulation. "We need to make the Digital European Single Market for e-economy come true," said Herman Narula. "That would be amazing for companies trying to build successful platforms." Media captionHerman Narula shares his vision for success in the UK If the UK wants to match the US in building vast technology companies, said Alex Depledge, matching its consumer base by tapping into Europe makes sense. "Imagine this, the US has a domestic market of 300 million consumers. In the UK our market is 70 million. But put us in Europe and it's 500 million. But the cost of us doing business across Europe is so much greater than the cost within the US, where state to state their markets are quite harmonised. "Unfortunately, for me, the vote for Brexit has just set ourselves back at least four or five steps in that mission to create companies as big as Apple and Google." It remains to be seen during Brexit negotiations whether the UK can gain access to any benefits from this emerging Digital Single Market. Ambition please, investors... "Too many conservative investors in Europe is a problem," said Stefano Tresca, "because now it's a global fight. "If you don't have the money to fight the US competition, however good you are, you can lose." David Kramaley is on the sharp end of this phenomenon. The American start-up entrepreneur is trying to make it in the UK with his chess app, Chessable. "European investors treat [you] cautiously and really want to know when they are going to see a return on their investment, [whereas] American investors feel they are part of the team," he explained. Media captionDavid Kramaley on how UK and US investors differ "Tech start-ups will always be risky ventures," he pointed out. "So it's not about lending, it's about being part of it." Moneybox founder Ben Stanway was also struck by this. "In the US they are very interested in what countries you want to expand into next," he recalled. "But in the UK we've had questions on whether we need to grow the team quite so fast." US tech firms raised $39bn (£25bn) last year, while UK ones raised $3.6bn (£2.4bn). But the problem isn't just down to frigidity among investors. There are bigger forces at work, according to two of our contributors. "We don't have the sophistication in the financial markets," explained Alex Depledge. There is funding available for the early stages of growth, she explained, but this starts to dry up when you need sums like £10m or more, to take your company to the next level. A US tech company can realistically look to float on the stock market, which is why they grow as big as they can, pointed out Stefano Tresca. Hence in their early days Google refused an offer from Yahoo, and Facebook resisted the charms of Google. There is less appetite among UK stock-pickers for tech companies, so instead UK tech companies grow to a reasonable size and sell out to a tech giant in a private sale. Eventually, all these entrepreneurs hope, it won't be just the ideas and the talent that originate in the UK, but the finance too. You can follow business reporter Dougal Shaw on Twitter or Facebook.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Leak  ⋮  Mobile Verizon Leaks Google Pixel Phone’s Additional Information, Including New Color Models By Omar Sohail Posted 1 month ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit There are a good 10 hours remaining for the official announcement from Google regarding its Pixel and Pixel XL, but Verizon has managed to spill some additional information about the two smartphones. This information will probably lead you to make into making a better decision when upgrading to a new Android handset in the foreseeable future. Verizon Leaks a New Color Model for the Google Pixel Phones, as Well as the Available Storage Capacities Thanks to Verizon, we now know that there are going to be a total of three color variants of the Pixel devices: Silver Black Blue One other feature that Verizon managed to leak about the handsets is something called ‘Google Magic’. It’s definitely a feature listed, but sadly, there is no description of what it will actually do. Hopefully, when one of the executives get up on stage and decide to showcase ‘Google Magic’ in front of our eyes, we will know more about what it can do. As for the strengthened security, that’s a feature that all pure-Android devices are known for. If you want the best security and software updates to be released for your device first, then you’d best be owning a Pixel smartphone, or a device with the brand name Nexus labelled on it. One other thing you should know is that you will have two storage options to choose from: 32 and 128GB of internal memory. Since these devices are not going to arrive with expandable storage, you should take your sweet time in deciding which one to get. If you’re going to keep your device for a significantly long period, then it’s highly recommended that you invest in the 128GB storage model. At times, even 32GB of internal memory might fall short, even for casual users, so make sure you have plenty of storage available at your disposal. Advertisement Disappointingly enough, there isn’t a 256GB storage model included, but that would be a bit overkill because 128GB is definitely the sweet spot for storage lovers. What Verizon didn’t cater to is the pricing and availability of these devices, but with only a few hours remaining, looks like we’ll get to know about these elusive details now, won’t we? If you want to know more about what’s going to be announced today, be sure to go through our Google’s October 4 event roundup so that you are brought up to speed.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google launched the Pixel and Pixel XL as a Verizon exclusive in the U.S., though you can also buy the phones unlocked straight from the Google Store website and at Best Buy. While Verizon is the only U.S. carrier selling the devices in stores, it looks like that may change early next month. AT&T is allegedly set to start selling the Pixel and Pixel XL in the first week of November, according to Android Central editor Jerry Hildenbrand. He shared the news on Twitter, noting that multiple “trustworthy” sources have been telling him the same thing. However, Hildenbrand admits that he doesn’t have enough evidence to report the rumor as news. @HsnAlmaweri @androidcentral OK. Pixel and Pixel XL at AT&T the first week of November. — Jerry Hildenbrand (@gbhil) October 6, 2016 Getting the new Pixel phones into AT&T stores would be a huge win for Google, especially if it happens as soon as early November before the busy holiday shopping season kicks off. It could help boost sales and give more people a chance to try out new features like Google Assistant by simply walking into a local carrier store. The Pixel and Pixel XL are solid flagship phones, though Google’s new hardware strategy still has its flaws. We’ll let you know if and when Verizon loses the exclusive on the Pixel.

Andy Boxall Digital TrendsOctober 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Look out Apple, Samsung, and just about every other smartphone maker out there, because Google’s coming for you with the new Pixel smartphones. There are two, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and they run the very latest version of Android, look super, and have some exclusive features to make sure smartphone fans sit up and take notice. They come just a few weeks after Apple’s latest iPhone models went on sale. Like the Pixel there are two different types, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and they both look great, have some special features not seen on other iPhones, and as always with an Apple launch, made people sit up and take notice. Related: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 — which 5-inch flagship is right for you? Inevitably, if you’re about to buy a new phone, these two will be on your list. The Pixel naturally goes up against the iPhone 7, so which one should you buy? Each phone has its own positive and negative points, and we’ve given them an thorough examination to find out which deserves your money. Google Pixel iPhone 7 Size 138.3 × 67.1 × 7.1 mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 in) 138.3 x 6.71 x 7.1 mm (5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.87 ounces (138 grams) Screen 4.7-inch Retina HD LED-backlit widescreen 4.7-inch Retina HD LED backlit screen Resolution 1,080 × 1,920 pixels (441 ppi) 1,334 x 750 pixels (326 ppi) OS Android 7.1 iOS 10 Storage 32, 128GB 32, 128, 256GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 A 10 Fusion with 64-bit architecture, M10 motion coprocessor RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 7MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30 or 60fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30 or 60fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated Yes, IP67 rated Battery 2,770mAh 1,960mAh Ports USB Type-C Lightning Marketplace Google Store Apple App Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, Jet Black, gold, rose gold, silver Availability Verizon, Google Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile Price $650 $650 DT review Hands-on  3.5 out of 5 stars Performance Google PixelMore The Google Pixel is bang up to date with its processor. It uses the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which is a small but significant update to the Snapdragon 820, seen in most major flagship phones released during 2016. The 64-bit Snapdragon 821 has four cores and gets a 10 percent performance bump over the already speedy Snapdragon 820, a 5 percent increase in graphical capabilities, is more energy efficient, and can use Quick Charge 3.0 for even faster battery recharging. Apple doesn’t use a Snapdragon chip, and instead uses the A10 Fusion chip of its own design. Apparently it’s 40 percent faster than the A9, according to Apple, and it’s the first time the company has used a quad-core chip. Both chips utilize the multiple cores in a similar way, splitting the workload across them to reduce power consumption during easy tasks. The Snapdragon 821 is so new, we’ve not seen a phone with it inside to test out yet, so establishing any of our own benchmarks is impossible. Early benchmark results seen in Geekbench 4 return a multi-core score of 4,089. The iPhone 7 managed 5,600. Does that make the Pixel a slowcoach? No, and we’re wary of that unconfirmed benchmark, as the Galaxy S7 regularly scores over 5,000, and it uses a Snapdragon 820 chip. At this early stage, we can’t say either phone is faster than the other. However, we know the iPhone 7 is quick, and have no reason to think the Snapdragon 821 will be any different. Elsewhere, the Pixel comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and doesn’t have a MicroSD card slot, sadly. The iPhone 7 adds a 256GB option to the list, so if masses of storage are important to you (and you can stomach the extra cost), the Apple phone has a slight advantage here. Winner: Tie (pending further tests) Design iphone-7More Read More This is ultimately going to come down to personal preference, but there are a few things you should keep in mind as you size the two up. The Pixel is made of metal, glass, and plastic. The glass panel on the rear provides the antenna with room to breathe, while the plastic sections recall manufacturer HTC’s Desire range of phones. It’s thin at 7.1mm and light at 143 grams. For the iPhone 7, Apple has blended in the antenna breaks more than on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, decluttering the rear panel, but keeping the camera bump. Google has avoided this by slightly enlarging the body itself. The iPhone 7’s body is made from aluminum, is 7.1mm thick, and a little lighter than the Pixel at 138 grams. In our hands-on, the Pixel is described as being, “high-end, not too heavy, or fragile, even with the half-glass back.” Concerns over the screen bezel are also unfounded, with it appearing larger in pictures than in real life. The iPhone 7 is extremely comfortable to hold, with wonderfully curved sides, and corners that nestle in the palm nicely. Arguably, the Pixel looks a lot like an iPhone, but this doesn’t really bother us — both are great looking phones. Google gives you the choice of a white, black, or limited edition blue Pixel, and it’s the blue that really catches the eye. The iPhone 7’s jet black color is the elusive limited edition for showoffs, and it’s the regular matte black that’s the winner, as it neatly conceals the antenna lines for a smooth look. Google’s phones have never been stunners, while the iPhone 7 has a class that the Pixel can’t quite match, supreme in-hand comfort, and a real premium build, which along with its lighter body and wider choice of colors sees it edge out the Pixel here. Winner: iPhone 7 Battery and audio Google Pixel phoneMore Google has selected a 2,770mAh battery for the Pixel, complete with fast charging provided by the Snapdragon 821 and Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 feature. Plug it in using the USB Type-C cable and after 15 minutes it’ll be at 70 percent capacity. We’ve not used the phone for long enough to judge the overall use time on a daily basis. Inside the iPhone 7 is a 1,960mAh battery and in our review, we have seen 12 hours of solid use, and more than 40 percent left at the end of a day. There’s no fast charging though, and recharging the iPhone 7 will take longer than the Pixel. Neither phone has wireless charging as standard. The iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, and audio performance is vastly improved over the iPhone 6S while the Pixel has a single downward firing speaker. However, the Pixel retains a 3.5mm headphone socket, while Apple forces you to use headphones with a Lightning connector or Bluetooth. More battery capacity, faster charging, and a traditional headphone socket make the Pixel a clear winner. Winner: Google Pixel Display Apple iPhone 7 PlusMore Looking at the numbers, the Pixel should run away here. The 5-inch display is an AMOLED panel, therefore producing deep blacks and strong colors. It has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution and a 441ppi pixel density, is covered in protective 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4, and Google claims it has an excellent viewing angle with little decrease in brightness. Related: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The iPhone’s Retina HD LED-backlit screen measures 4.7-inches, has a 1,334 x 750 pixel resolution for a 326ppi pixel density, and also a 2.5D piece of glass over the front. Although it has a lower resolution, it does still look great, but the Pixel’s AMOLED screen and higher pixel count will automatically make pictures, webpages, and games look better. However, there is one thing in the iPhone 7’s favor, and that’s 3D Touch, Apple’s pressure sensitive system. Here, additional functionality can be accessed with a harder screen press, and it’s surprisingly helpful, especially with iOS 10 installed. The Pixel doesn’t have this feature. Despite this, it’s as much a software feature as it is a display feature, giving the Pixel the win. Winner: Google Pixel Camera Google Pixel phoneMore Let’s start with a spec shootout. The Pixel and the iPhone 7 both have 12-megapixel rear cameras. The Pixel has an f/2.0 aperture against the iPhone 7’s f/1.8 aperture, which should let in a little more light, plus it has a quad-LED flash rather than the Pixel’s dual-LED. However, while both have phase detection autofocus, laser autofocus only comes on the Pixel. Both have image stabilization, but only the iPhone uses traditional OIS, as the Pixel has a clever system that utilizes the phone’s gyroscope for smoothing out video. We’re big fans of the iPhone 7’s camera, although consider the iPhone 7 Plus to be the real winner, but have yet to really put the Pixel’s camera to the test. In our hands-on with the phone, we noted the speed with which it captured and processed photos, along with its low-light performance and cool HDR+ mode. The Pixel also has free, unlimited full resolution photo storage in the cloud through Google Photos, while you’ll have to pay for extra iCloud space or full-res Google Photos storage if you own an iPhone. Until we get our hands on the Pixel for a full review, we must turn to well-respected camera testers DxOMark, where the Pixel received an 89 rating, the highest of any smartphone yet. The iPhone 7 isn’t far behind with 86 though. It’s likely to be a tight contest between the iPhone 7 and the Pixel here, just like it is between the iPhone and the Galaxy S7, so we’re calling it a tie for now. Winner: Tie (Pending further tests) Durability Apple iPhone 7 PlusMore Unless these phones are securely wrapped up in a case, neither are going to come off well in the event of a nasty fall. Glass and aluminum bodies aren’t designed to withstand much shock. It’s also worth mentioning that if you choose the jet black iPhone 7 and don’t wrap it in a case, expect it to gather up some scratches and scuffs pretty quickly. Apple knows the special finish is delicate, and recommends the use of a case. Apple now edges ahead of the Pixel here, having made the iPhone meet IP67 standards of splash, water, and dust resistance. We’ve tested this out, and the iPhone happily continues working after taking a bath, something the Pixel is unlikely to do even with its basic IP53 protection. Accidents happen, and if they involve the wet stuff, you’ll be glad it was the iPhone and not the Pixel underwater. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Software Google PixelMore If design was a difficult category to judge, due to personal preference playing a considerable role, software is also subjective. Unlike pitting a phone like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 against the Pixel, Apple is prompt and regular with its software updates, which matches how Google will react with its new Pixel devices. The Pixel comes with Android 7.1 installed, the very latest version of the operating system, which can’t (and won’t) be found in this form anywhere else. The Apple iPhone has iOS 10. The two are very different, yet also quite alike. There are icons to tap, a virtual assistant to help — Assistant on the Pixel and Siri on the iPhone — and special messaging apps for both. On the Pixel, it’s Duo for video calls and Allo for chats, while on the iPhone there’s FaceTime and iMessage. Downsides of Google’s operating system don’t really apply here. It’s going to get regular updates, there’s no messy user interface over the top, and you’re assured of the latest version for at least a few years yet. Apple treats the iPhone in the same way. There’s little to choose between them when it comes to app stores either, with both being equally well stocked with apps, books, movies, and more. Winner: Tie Pricing and availability Apple iPhone 7More Wallets at the ready? They better be, because you’re going to have to open them pretty wide to get either one of these phones. Unlocked, without a contract, the Pixel will cost you $650 for the 32GB model or $750 for the 128GB, and it can be purchased directly through the Google Play Store. The iPhone 7 also costs $650 for the 32GB, $750 for the 128GB, and then $850 for the 256GB model. It can be bought through the Apple Store, either online or in a retail store. Contract prices vary for the iPhone, but it’s available with each major carrier in the U.S., while the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive. This hurts the Pixel here. We don’t like being forced onto one carrier and many people buy their phones in stores. However, there is good news for the Pixel: You can buy it unlocked from Google and get the same month-to-month financing you get with the iPhone at carriers. We’d suggest not buying either phone locked to a network, or fixed into a contract, anyway. There are financing options available for both the Pixel and the iPhone 7 through Google and Apple respectively too. However, be aware if you choose an iPhone on AT&T or Sprint with financing through Apple, it’ll be locked to that network. International buyers will also find it easier to buy an iPhone 7, with 25 countries on the list at launch, and more than 30 having been added since then. Others are coming in October. Google is only selling the Pixel in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany at the moment. Wider availability, more carrier options, and equal pricing sees the iPhone take this category. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Overall winner: iPhone 7 (for now) It’s three category wins for the iPhone 7, and two for the Pixel, with three overall ties. However, two of those sections will likely have a different result when we’ve played with the Pixel for a longer amount of time, so there’s still everything to play for. It’s interesting to see where the iPhone 7 beats the Google Pixel, particularly because durability and price have long been problem areas for Apple, and winners for Android phones. Apple has turned that around with the iPhone 7. The Pixel has it beaten when it comes to display, battery, and the presence of a 3.5mm headphone socket. Right now, because you can buy it in more places, with fewer restrictions, and it won’t stop working if it gets wet, the iPhone 7 has to take the win.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google Hangouts to be replaced by Duo in the Google Apps package for Android Christian de Looper Digital TrendsOctober 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google has updated Hangouts to version 14.0, bringing a number of new features to the app. The most notable change? Android 7.1 app shortcuts. The app shortcuts available on Hangouts include "Chat," "Video call," and "Voice call."More It looks like Google is moving its focus away from Hangouts and toward other solutions. Although not unexpected, the company today started sending emails to Mobile Service partners saying that Hangouts would be removed from the core Android apps package. What that means is that hardware manufacturers will no longer have to bundle Hangout with their new hardware, a change that will take effect starting on December 1, according to a report from Android Police. Related: Hangouts for Android version 11 removes threaded SMS messaging So what’s replacing Hangouts? Google Duo, it seems. Duo is Google’s new video chatting app, which offers a number of new features, such as “knock knock,” which allows the person being called to see a feed of the person calling them before they answer the call. It’s important to note that this doesn’t mean that Hangouts is dead. It just means that if you want to continue using it on your Android device, you’ll need to head to the Play Store and download it yourself rather than having it preinstalled on any new Android device you buy. This also doesn’t mean that manufacturers can’t bundle Hangouts with their phones — although it’s likely that they won’t as a way to push their own apps and services. It is somewhat interesting that it’s Duo replacing Hangouts and not Allo, but it does highlight that Google has a big focus on video messaging. As you might remember, Hangouts had video messaging functionality as well. It’s also interesting that Allo isn’t already mandatory as an app on Android, especially given the fact that Allo has an uphill battle ahead of it in competing with services like Facebook Messenger, Kik, WhatsApp, and so on. Google’s message to partners notes that the company will continue to support Hangouts for the foreseeable future, which makes sense. It seems as though Hangouts is being pivoted to a business messaging platform, so we’ll continue to see improvements made to the app over time. Google Duo will be pre-installed on the four upcoming Micromax phones Hands-on: Google Allo Hands on: Google Duo Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next All the Photoshops of this photo of Donald Trump and Barack Obama are perfect BGR News Watch a Tesla Model S P100D race against a $265,000 McLaren 650S Spider BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech “This campaign was never about you”: A former Hillary Clinton staffer on the candidate’s powerful legacy Quartz New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech Niantic explains why it ruined Pokemon Go for everybody BGR News This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network
CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel phone carrier details and pricing review Chris Burns - Oct 7, 2016 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Today we’re having a very brief and simple look at the various ways in which a person might purchase and utilize a Google Pixel or Google Pixel XL smartphone. There aren’t a whole lot of options, at first glance – Verizon even seems to be pushing the idea that they will be the sole carrier option for the smartphone, the only place a person will be able to buy from! But they’re not. And it’s not. Google has made this decision very simple for people that check news and review sources like SlashGear before they buy. Point 1: do not buy directly from Verizon [UPDATE: maybe do!] Even if I planned on purchasing a Pixel or Pixel XL to use with my Verizon SIM card, I would not purchase it directly from Verizon. The one reason for this is, while I don’t assume I’ll get updates forever, I still want them for as long as possible, and as quick as possible. • Google handles and delivers Android security patches • Google delivers OS updates, but only at first… Google delivers OS updates to Verizon. Verizon then takes those updates and puts the update through a certification process, which – as we know – can take a while. Or perhaps Verizon has streamlined their process. You never know.* But why take the chance? *We do know now – or at least Verizon has made a promise. Updates at the same time regardless of if we purchased the device with Verizon or Google. How about that? Google’s goal in working with Verizon was and is to have it available in the United States’ topmost used and visited wireless smart device carrier store. Some people, believe it or not, simply go to their wireless carrier and buy a new phone when they need one, no research done, completely dependent on the store employees themselves. That’s a real thing. That really happens. As such, Google needs the shelf space Verizon can provide, as well as the pocketbooks that are only opened in Verizon stores nationwide. Point 2: Google has the same device The Google Store online has the exact same device as Verizon. Not just a slightly different bit of hardware with different branding. Literally the same hardware. This is made possible by Qualcomm, which delivers technology which allows any of the carriers in the USA (and most/all outside the USA) to pop in a SIM card and go. The only differences between the Verizon-sold and Google-sold versions of the device are the following: • Verizon has a trade-in program where my old phone could be worth up to $300. Or I could sell that phone basically anywhere else and more than likely get more than Verizon could give me. • Neither version has preloaded apps from Verizon. There are three apps from Verizon which will automatically install themselves from the Google Play app store once a device is activated with a Verizon SIM card, but they’ll all immediately be able to be uninstalled, easy peasy. • The Verizon-sold Pixel has ONE software difference right out the gate – its bootloader is encrypted. If I didn’t ever want to modify the software of the Pixel at a ROM-level, I wouldn’t worry about this. But I’d like the option, especially since… Point 3: Both Google and Verizon’s Pixel cost the same If I buy the Pixel from Google it’ll be $650 or $27 a month. It’s the same pricing from Verizon*, and both stores have free shipping. *Except Verizon adds a $20 activation fee. Google and Verizon also have their own “protection plans”. Google’s Protection Plan costs either $79 or $99 for 2-years of coverage and Verizon’s Protection Plan costs $11 a month (that’s $264 for two years). Point 4: Freebie VR! Both the Verizon-sold and the Google-sold Pixel and Pixel XL include a free Daydream View VR headset. Google is really pushing the Daydream with this release – really, really pushing it hard. Sound like a good deal? Find the Pixel in the Google Store online and use the SIM card you already have. Even if it’s from Verizon. Or AT&T, T-Mobile USA, or anyone else.

 More software engineers over age 40 may join a lawsuit against Google Julie Bort Oct. 7, 2016, 3:53 PM 35,329 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty / Justin Sullivan Google suffered a setback in an age discrimination suit this week. A judge ruled that other software engineers over age 40 who interviewed with the company but didn't get hired can step forward and join the lawsuit. The suit was brought by two job applicants, both over the age of 40, who interviewed but weren't offered jobs. Specifically, the judge has approved turning the suit into a "collective action" meaning that people who "interviewed in person with Google for a software engineer, site reliability engineer, or systems engineer position when they were 40 years old or older, and received notice on or after August 28, 2014, that they were refused employment, will have an opportunity to join in the collective action against Google," the ruling says.  While this isn't good news for Google, the ruling was strictly focused on whether the suit could be broadened to include more people. It doesn't meant that Google will ultimately lose the case. Google says it's fighting the suit. A spokesperson told us, "We believe the allegations here are without merit and we will continue to defend our position vigorously. We have strong policies against discrimination on any unlawful basis, including age." Interestingly, the judge is particularly not buying that "policies" defense from Google, writing in the ruling:  "Having such a policy does not necessarily shield a company from a discrimination suit, particularly in light of the evidence and allegations presented here ... today, most, if not all, companies are well versed in anti-discrimination and make great efforts to ensure their written policies comply with anti-discrimination law." In terms of allegations, one of the plaintiffs alleged that a Google recruiter told her she needed to puts the dates of her graduation on her resume so interviewers could determine her age. That same plaintiff argued that she had found seven others who say they had similar experiences at Google. She also presented evidence to the court that the median age of Google's workforce is 29 while the median age in the US for programmers is 42.8 years old. How old are Google employees? Google has about 61,000 employees and we asked Google if the company has publicly released statistics on its median age. Age is not included with the company's published diversity report, which discusses sex and race. Google didn't respond. Father of the Internet and Google employee Vint Cerf is one example of the Google's "Greyglers" group Google However, we do know that Google has a diversity club on campus called "Greyglers" which is for Googler employees over 40. The company describes it as a group for "company elders" that helps the company with "promoting age diversity awareness." The company was sued way back in 2004 for age discrimination and, after winding through the appeals system, the case was ultimately settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Still, just allowing people who went on job interviews but didn't get a job to join a suit is a startling turn of events.  Some folks on Hacker News, a site where programmers discuss news items of interest to them, worry that instead of solving the tech industry's age discrimination problem, it will make it worse. One wrote:  "Fallout from this: Companies will go to great lengths to avoid contact with people who submit resumes that imply they are old. No phone screens, no responses. It's going to be wintertime for folks in their late 30s now."

The secret scanning tool rocked the tech world and that of privacy and anti-surveillance activists this week, shocked by how broad the request was, and the fact that it had kept under wraps. Until Reuters reported its existence this week, the tool remained a secret not just to the public, but also to most people at Yahoo, including the security team, which caught it and thought it was a sophisticated and dangerous piece of malware installed by hackers, as reported by Motherboard on Friday. Read more: A Frustrating Conversation About Privacy With Google's New Allo Chatbot In an age where the FBI asked Apple to unlock the iPhone of a dead terrorist, and countless top secret documents revealed the vast surveillance powers of the NSA, asking Yahoo to use a scanning tool that former employees defined as a “buggy” and a “poorly designed” “backdoor” or “rootkit,” was an unusual request as it wasn’t targeted—Yahoo was essentially looking through the whole haystack looking for a few needles—and the company apparently didn’t fight back. But such a request is a perfect example of how the rise of encryption technologies have changed the face of government surveillance. Before large tech companies such as Google and Yahoo turned on default encryption across their services, including email—in the process protecting their customers data as it travelled from their computers to the company’s servers, as well as when the data travelled through the internet—the NSA could’ve gone through users’ data without having to knock on Yahoo’s door. “Five years ago the government would’ve just done this by spying on international telecommunications traffic.” “Five years ago the government would’ve just done this by spying on international telecommunications traffic,” Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, told Motherboard. As revealed by documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the NSA and its British partner GCHQ have taps on the internet backbone infrastructure, and used to collect data directly from what they called “upstream” provides, none other than large ISPs. Before the Snowden revelations, when companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo, and other email providers didn’t use encryption, all these emails were travelling in the clear over the internet, and were collected by spy agencies. An illustration of how email travels across the internet, without STARTTLS. (Image: Riseup.net) Especially in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks, companies started adopting HTTPS, which encrypts connections between users and the server, and STARTTLS, which encrypts emails as they travel through the internet between providers. In 2014, Google reported that, for the prior year, only 33 percent of emails between Gmail and other providers were encrypted. The number rose to 58 percent in 2014, when major providers like Yahoo and Microsoft also adopted STARTTLS. Now, it’s almost pervasive, at more than 80 percent. An illustration of how email travels across the internet, with STARTTLS. (Image: Riseup.net) “Every time a provider turns on STARTTLS the NSA loses access to more and more email,” Soghoian told me. “NSA has lost a good percentage of its visibility into international email traffic without the help of tech companies.” Without the ability to just ingest emails travelling across the internet and looking through their content, the NSA has to ask the Yahoos, Googles and Microsofts of the world to do that for them now. In a way, this is the same issue the FBI and police are encountering when trying to break into iPhones, or intercepting end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp. The data is now encrypted, and without some help hacking in, there’s no way in.

Google launches Android Pay at 5,000 Hong Kong locations 20 Oct 2016 Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with US$3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple. Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign”. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. The battle for smartphone supremacy: Google unveils new Pixel phone and VR headset to take on Apple and Amazon Wireless carrier Verizon Communications, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. “When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you,” he said. “But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 3 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 Elon Musk’s surprise unveiling of Tesla’s ‘solar roof’ Shared 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 3 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 China’s giant FAST radio telescope to join hunt for extraterrestrial intelligence Commented 1 Beijing confirms it will interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy 2 Oath-row intervention reflects Beijing’s distrust of Hong Kong judges, lawyers say 3 Hong Kong charities, unions and political organisations refuse to ‘say no to shark’s fin’ 4 Taiwan calls on Beijing to reopen dialogue to pave way for peace deal 5 How did China’s Xi Jinping secure ‘core’ status in just four years?

Here Are 9 Other Products They Straight Up Ditched By Stephen Clark  |  October 7, 2016  |  2:30pm Tech Lists google Share Tweet Text This week Google has commandeered all the headlines in the tech world with its announcement of not just two new smartphones, but also a whole bevy of other devices along with it. While there’s plenty of reasons to be excited for the new Pixel phone, Google is quietly killing the Nexus phone program. The hardware in Nexus phones and tablets have always been based on a major manufacturer’s flagship device, which doesn’t make much sense under Google’s new unified Hardware Division. Adapting third party manufacturer hardware to create a reference spec may return someday, but it will probably not be given the Nexus name. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. The truth is when you have as much money as Google, you can afford to bet on longshots. For every wildly successful product like Gmail, there’s a Buzz or Wave. In some ways, there’s something refreshing about Google’s willingness to invest in ideas and give them up when they actually don’t make sense anymore. What happened to Google’s longshot hardware ideas? We take a look through the hardware and concepts that Google has abandoned over the years. 1. Nexus Q The Nexus Q was announced at the Google I/O Developers Conference in 2012. It impressed many with a wealth of input formats, high-quality audio output, and network connectivity. Some were given away at first, but for $299 customers expected more when compared to the $99 Apple TV. It was discontinued before launching and the niche was filled a year later by the more capable Chromecast at nearly one-tenth the price. 2. Nexus Player Google TV was built upon Android 3.2 Honeycomb, but never caught on. When they relaunched the effort as Android TV built on 6.0 Marshmallow, Google released reference hardware in the Nexus Player to promote the experience. At only $99, Google was now in direct competition with the Apple TV. It featured voice search and a more open architecture for app development. Less than two years later Google discontinued it and underwhelming sales may have been to blame. 3. Low Cost Tablets Google released announced the Nexus 7 tablet for only $199 packaged with free content and a $25 credit on the Google Play store. They followed it up with the Nexus 4, a phone which matched flagship specs but cost as little as $299. Both devices were less than half that of flagship devices from Apple or the other Android manufacturers. While we did eventually get the Nexus 5, we never got our update to the Nexus 7. There was a hardware update to the Nexus 7 but third party suppliers didn’t like Google undercutting them. 4. Play Edition Phones Back in 2013, Android had a serious fragmentation problem. Every major manufacturer had their own custom tweaks to the OS making an inconsistent experience for both users and developers. Along comes the Play Edition series. Google took the flagship smartphones from Samsung, HTC, Sony and Motorola (and a tablet from LG) and built the same basic Android experience on each that you get from the Nexus devices. They still were sold at premium prices so sales paled in comparison to the Nexus 4. Interest by the manufacturers quickly waned and the program was cut the next year. 5. Google Wallet Card Many Android smartphones have NFC chips for secure purchases, but they are by no means in all of them. When Google Wallet was launched in 2011 they also released a debit card letting you access your account wherever you could use plastic. Google eliminated support for the debit card in July of this year to focus on their rising competition, namely Apple Pay. 6. Google Search Appliance Put the power of Google on your internal corporate network. Just one box can give you Google-like access to up to 30 million documents. Including features we love like autocomplete and user profiles, and a catalog of up to 20 languages and hundreds of file formats. Support is destined to end by 2018 with no new hardware planned. Instead, Google is pushing towards cloud-based search making many system administrators uneasy. 7. Google Glass In what looked like an attempt to jump ahead several generations in personal computing, Google released a heads-up display that floats just in front of the user’s eyeball. Featuring a camera, microphone, and internet-connectivity, it was the general public’s worst privacy nightmare. The conspicuous design of the headware meant “Glassholes” could be easily spotted. It became clear the world wasn’t ready for Glass, but the project earned Google a wealth of patents. It still exists as a B2B solution, but is no longer available in the public marketplace. 8. Project Ara An ambitious project was intended as part of Google’s effort to get low-cost phones into developing markets. The plan was to sell a framework where cell phone components like processor, GPS, camera, screen and more could be swapped out. Each can be removed and upgraded without having to replace the whole phone. By the start of 2016 the project was modified to force certain core components into the non-upgradable framework. By September of the same year the project was shelved altogether. 9. Google Talking Shoes Technically more of an experiment than a product destined for market. Google played with interactive designers YesYesNo to give shoes motion sensors, internet-connectivity, and… a personality? The idea was to show what’s possible by giving technology some character. How would we interact differently if we felt judged by our footwear? Like a concept car, the technology may someday become a part of our lives but this shoe won’t be in stores any time soon.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently. But, maybe it doesn’t work super-great just yet. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Watch Google’s presentation from Tuesday, and read our roundup of everything that was announced. Read Brian Barrett’s story on Pixel’s place in the Android world. Margaret Rhodes on Google’s “Trojan Horse” plan for AI. This week, David recommends Keep, and Michael recommends the now-dirt-cheap Nexus 5X.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better. David’s feature story about Fitbit’s quest to get more people wearing Fitbits. David again on smartwatches and fitness trackers. Recommendations this week: Authy and the Garmin Forerunner 735XT.

Wired Staff Gear Date of Publication: 11.04.16. 11.04.16 Time of Publication: 3:40 pm. 3:40 pm Human Enough On this week’s Gadget Lab Podcast, we discuss voice assistants. We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants. David’s recommendation this week is Poisonfeather by Matthew Fitzsimmons. Michael recommends Amanda yerba mate.

For now, some of us still need powerful PCs. This week, we got to see that Microsoft and Apple are still intent on wowing our socks off when it comes to hardware for developers and creative professionals. With the new Surface Studio from Microsoft and the redesigned MacBook Pro from Apple, we’ve got some great options. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Surface Studio looks hot. So does the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Also see David’s hands-on report. Margaret Rhodes has some additional thoughts on the Touch Bar as well. There’s also a new Surface Book from Microsoft. David’s recommendation this week is Lessons From the Screenplay. Michael’s is the Jaybird X3 sweat-proof wireless earphones.

The Pixel maybe just tipped the scales, and it did so right at the moment we’re getting ready to move on to something else. With so many voice-controlled, non-smartphone devices in our homes, it sure feels like we’re at a flux point. Also, the Google Assistant, which lives in the Pixel, is so so powerful, and we’re headed for more of that. Michael and David (who is back from Bogota) discuss the changes in the personal tech landscape. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David’s review of the Google Pixel. A gallery of the full-size images he shot with the phone in Colombia. Tim Moynihan’s story about the Pixel’s advanced camera technology. David’s recommendation this week is Textra, the best default messaging app for Android. Michael’s recommendation is Bob Dylan’s Planet Waves.

We bring in an expert, WIRED’s own Peter Rubin, to chart all of it. Peter manages WIRED’s culture and entertainment coverage and co-hosts The Monitor, our culture podcast. Peter is also well-steeped in face computers: he’s written stellar stories about Oculus and he’s been testing and ranking each new VR system as it’s released. With David out this week, Michael and Peter talk about PSVR, Google Daydream View, and the future of “untethered” real-deal VR. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Read Peter’s review of the Sony PlayStation VR headset and his report from last week’s Oculus Connect. Also, Chris Kohler writes about rhythm games and short-play games in VR. David Pierce has the details on Google’s phone-based Daydream View. Recommendations this week: People Just Do Nothing on Netflix and the Talkhouse podcasts.

What we watch, what we watch it on, and what we do while we watch it. Not only is the technology of TV changing, but the content is morphing in a way that alters what we think of as “television.” Is a YouTube video TV? Sure, right. What about a Snapchat story, or a local city council meeting on Twitter? Yes—why not. The hosts discuss these changes in light of YouTube’s new app, Twitter’s new strategy, Snap’s new hardware, and Roku’s new future-proofed players. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David Pierce’s story on YouTube Go. The video from Vox about “the package” in Cuba. Brian Barrett on Snap Specs, and the WSJ feature that dropped suddenly. David also wrote about football on Twitter. Tim Moynihan’s rundown of the new boxes from Roku. David on Alto, the new email app from AOL. Easy, on Netflix.

Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library: For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Build settings To disable building the sandbox completely build with this in your mozconfig: ac_add_options --disable-sandbox To disable just the content sandbox parts: ac_add_options --disable-content-sandbox Environment variables Disable content process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX Disable media plugin sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_GMP_SANDBOX Disable NPAPI process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_NPAPI_SANDBOX Allow weaker than default sandbox level MOZ_ALLOW_WEAKER_SANDBOX Enable sandbox logging MOZ_WIN_SANDBOX_LOGGING Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Overview Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Environment variables Enable sandbox logging MOZ_SANDBOX_VERBOSE Bug Lists Milestones Windows Content Process sbwc1 Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release. sbwc2 Roll out level 2 sandbox policy to release.

But privilege escalation via kernel vulnerabilities is relatively common, so we also use the seccomp-bpf system call filter to reduce the attack surface that a compromised content process can directly access.

The app will become part of GMS on December 1 and will replace Hangouts, will will become an optional GMS install. What this means is that, starting on December 1, manufacturers that want to install Google apps like Gmail and Google on their Android devices will also have to install Duo. This news shows that Google is really pushing Duo, hoping to make it the go-to video calling app for Android users. Making the app a required part of the GMS package will put Duo front and center on new Android phones, exposing it to millions of people that may not normally have known about it.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme No one should buy a Pixel smartphone from Verizon No one should buy a Pixel smartphone from Verizon By Joel Hruska on October 7, 2016 at 3:04 pm Comment Verizon is the major carrier partner for Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL. But that doesn’t mean it’s your only option for getting a device. Google will also sell Pixels directly from its own storefront — and if you care at all about system updates, unlocked bootloaders, or avoiding crapware, then the Google version of the device is the only one to buy. Granted, Verizon’s predatory business practices and relentless assault on customer privacy make it difficult for us to recommend buying anything from the company, but that’s something of a separate issue. First, here’s what Google has said on the topic. In an email to 9to5Google, the company writes: Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store. Verizon’s device has a locked bootloader, and comes with three pre-installed applications you don’t need — My Verizon, Go90 (a mobile TV app), and Verizon Messaging. The split between security updates and system updates means that while Google will guarantee you get your security updates, you won’t get newer versions of Android except on Verizon’s timeline — which basically means you won’t get new versions of Android until months later, if ever. Just because Google is handling security updates doesn’t mean those updates will continue to flow to older devices, mind you — over the past few years we’ve seen Google refuse to patch older versions of Android, even when failing to do so left hundreds of millions of devices vulnerable to known attacks. Regardless, if you plan to buy a Pixel and use it for more than 18 to 24 months, you should buy it from Google — that way you’ve got the best chance of getting both security and operating system updates in the future. Repeated studies have shown Apple does a better job than Google and the associated carriers do of keeping devices maintained. But Google Nexus products have typically been the best-supported over the long term of all Android devices. The Pixel is being advertised as a Verizon exclusive, but ignore that — the phone is actually widely available from major stores and outlets. Best Buy, Amazon, Target, and Google’s Project Fi all advertise the hardware, and the Pixel has been explicitly guaranteed to work on any US carrier. It’s not a Verizon-specific product, no matter what some of the ad copy says. So do yourself a favor and buy the unlocked Pixel, not the inferior Verizon-specific model.

Follow TechnoBuffalo In case you needed a reminder as to why an autonomous future is necessary and important, look no further than this report filed by Google. The search giant on Thursday released a report revealing one its self-driving cars was involved in an accident that sent the operator to the hospital. After a brief investigation, it was discovered the driver of a commercial van was found to be at fault after running a red light and t-boning Google’s self-driving car. According to Google, the autonomous vehicle noticed the van barreling toward it and slammed on the brakes, but not in time to avoid a collision. It’s unclear what caused the van to run the red light but it’s not far-fetched to think the driver may have been distracted. Whatever the cause, it underlines why autonomous technology could be a positive change for our roadways. Of course, autonomous technology isn’t without its faults. Earlier this year, one of Google’s self-driving cars caused an accident by changing lanes into a bus. That accident resulted in no major injuries. Meanwhile, a driver using Tesla’s prototype self-driving software was killed after he and the technology failed to avoid a truck that had turned into his path. Self-driving technology still needs a lot of work before it makes a significant impact on our daily lives. Until that happens, it’s clear that human drivers are susceptible to mistakes, which is why working toward an autonomous future is so important.

It has the “best smartphone camera ever” perhaps (that’s still yet to be officially determined, other than by DxOMark), there are some hardware optimizations, and the phone sports the super-new and super-fast Snapdragon 821. But other than that, Google is relying mostly on software to set this phone apart from the crowd. That’s fine by me, except for the fact that most of the software features Google is touting are only artificially exclusive to the Pixel. One of the most obvious is Assistant, Google’s AI-powered evolution of Google Now that the Mountain View company is putting in a lot of its new products. It’s built-in to Allo, it’s the central interface for Google Home, and of course, it’s front-and-center with a new home button on the Pixel phones. What frustrates me, though, is that there’s not really any reason other than helping push the Pixel out the door to hold it back from last year’s Nexus phones. Google, the company that has long pioneered Android as “open,” is closing some things off… This reminds me a lot of the launch of Siri on the iPhone 4S, which Apple famously touted as the big selling point of the phone — while holding the feature back from software updates to the iPhone 4. It was purely a software feature, and Apple used it as the central selling point. Perhaps this isn’t the best comparison, though, because the performance difference between iPhone 4 and 4S was a lot more substantial than, let’s say, the Nexus 6P and the Pixel XL. Apple might have had some justification for that decision. Google also has some justification, but it really comes only in the form of exclusivity and marketing. As our own Ben Schoon even admitted himself, a big reason he jumped on the Pixel bandwagon is because it just has lots of software exclusives that are hard to pass up. Assistant is the big one, but the Pixel and Pixel XL also offer 24/7 customer care, a lot of Android 7.1 features, the Pixel Launcher, and unlimited full quality photo and video backup with Google Photos. Some of these will eventually make their way to some of the newer Nexus devices, but for now, Google is using them to get you to spend $650+ on a phone that actually leaves a decent amount to be desired in the hardware department. The physical design isn’t exactly groundbreaking, there’s no waterproofing, there’s no OIS, there’s only one bottom-firing speaker… Perhaps the other justification Google has for limiting Assistant’s launch on older Nexus devices for the time being is to give it — and Google — a chance to learn some more and iron out some kinks before being pushed out to the “masses” (I put that in quotes because the number of people using Nexus devices is insanely small compared to the entire smartphone market). But I don’t really buy that, because Google already released Assistant publicly in the form of Allo. And anyone on any device — including iPhone — can download it and try it out right now. Rather, I think that Google wants its hardcore Nexus fanbase to help it promote the Pixel and get some sales moving out the gate. Honestly, if Google had released (or even directly promised) the Assistant in a software update — or even a developer preview — for the Nexus 6P and 5X, how many of Google’s most loyal fans who bought a Nexus last year would skip out on the Pixel and Pixel XL for now (or even entirely)? I think the number would be pretty decent. But it’s still annoying to me. Google has long trumpeted Android as an open platform and has never used software exclusivity to sell its hardware like this before. It’s a very Apple-like move, and only in the worst way. Google seems to be waking up to the fact that top-to-bottom control of its software and hardware will be the only way it can produce phones that have the “fit and finish” to compete well with the iPhone (although we aren’t really seeing the benefits of this with the Pixel, yet), but unfortunately they’re throwing long-time Nexus fans and loyalists under the bus in the process. Other than pushing sales of the Pixel, there’s no reason the Nexus 6P can’t have Assistant today. This has to be artificial for the most part, because even Google itself says that they want to allow 3rd-parties to put the Assistant on anything. “We imagine a future where the assistant will be able to help from any context and from any kind of device,” the company said at its event earlier this week. They even mentioned the eventual possibility that Assistant could run on a Raspberry Pi. And one of our anonymous tipsters (if you’re reading this, feel free to send us an anonymous encrypted email, we’d really love to chat), who has told us some things that ended up confirmed, also suggests that this is the case. We’re hearing from said tipster that internal developer Nexus devices have the Assistant running “perfectly” (The Verge also mentioned it running on the Nexus 6P in a lengthy feature). Further, this person confirms the obvious, saying that Google is holding it back for a some amount of time to give Pixel the exclusive. The Android 7.1 change log that Android Police obtained, however, clearly distinguishes which features are Pixel-exclusive. The developer preview for Android 7.1 is said to be coming at least to the 6P, 5X, and Pixel C, by the end of the year. Here’s what Google told us on the matter: There will be certain features — such as the Google Assistant — that will be unique to Pixel before we make a decision to offer it up to the rest of the ecosystem.  With some of these features currently unique to Pixel, we’re carefully experimenting with these changes to assess user reaction and feedback. So when and which devices in Google’s portfolio will get the Assistant is entirely up in the air for the moment. Which, I don’t know about you, is probably a sign of things to come. It’s clear that the Pixel line is going to basically have its own fork of Android (which, actually, was true of the Nexus phones as well considering they didn’t run technically pure “stock” AOSP). What’s confusing is that we’ve now heard of a couple cases where Google is considering Nexus-like devices. The Huawei tablet that we’ve (and Evan Blass, and some others) heard about is one of them (which likely won’t be Pixel-branded, as Huawei refused to let Google remove its branding for the Pixel), but Android Police also noted that Huawei is being “solicited by Google” to make a mid-range smartphone as well for launch next year. Assistant is probably just the first of many features that make up the “more opinionated” exclusives of the Pixel line, and while it’s exciting that Google is taking the bull by the horns and trying to deliver a unique and compelling top-to-bottom smartphone package, it’s also going to be unfortunate for those that want to stick with Android but would perhaps prefer hardware from other companies (or in this case, would like to stick with Google’s hardware from last year for a while).

By Andy Boxall — October 7, 2016 11:51 AM Subscribe to this topic Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Apple iPhone 7 MSRP $649.00 DT Recommended Product Learn More Look out Apple, Samsung, and just about every other smartphone maker out there, because Google’s coming for you with the new Pixel smartphones. There are two, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and they run the very latest version of Android, look super, and have some exclusive features to make sure smartphone fans sit up and take notice. They come just a few weeks after Apple’s latest iPhone models went on sale. Like the Pixel there are two different types, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and they both look great, have some special features not seen on other iPhones, and as always with an Apple launch, made people sit up and take notice. Related: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 — which 5-inch flagship is right for you? Inevitably, if you’re about to buy a new phone, these two will be on your list. The Pixel naturally goes up against the iPhone 7, so which one should you buy? Each phone has its own positive and negative points, and we’ve given them an thorough examination to find out which deserves your money. Google Pixel iPhone 7 Size 143.8 × 69.5 × 7.3 mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 in) 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.87 ounces (138 grams) Screen 5-inch AMOLED 4.7-inch Retina HD LED backlit screen Resolution 1,080 × 1,920 pixels (441 ppi) 1,334 x 750 pixels (326 ppi) OS Android 7.1 iOS 10 Storage 32, 128GB 32, 128, 256GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 A 10 Fusion with 64-bit architecture, M10 motion coprocessor RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12.3MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 7MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30, 60, or 120fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30 or 60fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated Yes, IP67 rated Battery 2,770mAh 1,960mAh Ports USB Type-C Lightning Marketplace Google Store Apple App Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, Jet Black, gold, rose gold, silver Availability Verizon, Google Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile Price $650 $650 DT review Hands-on  3.5 out of 5 stars Performance The Google Pixel is bang up to date with its processor. It uses the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which is a small but significant update to the Snapdragon 820, seen in most major flagship phones released during 2016. The 64-bit Snapdragon 821 has four cores and gets a 10 percent performance bump over the already speedy Snapdragon 820, a 5 percent increase in graphical capabilities, is more energy efficient, and can use Quick Charge 3.0 for even faster battery recharging. Apple doesn’t use a Snapdragon chip, and instead uses the A10 Fusion chip of its own design. Apparently it’s 40 percent faster than the A9, according to Apple, and it’s the first time the company has used a quad-core chip. Both chips utilize the multiple cores in a similar way, splitting the workload across them to reduce power consumption during easy tasks. The Snapdragon 821 is so new, we’ve not seen a phone with it inside to test out yet, so establishing any of our own benchmarks is impossible. Early benchmark results seen in Geekbench 4 return a multi-core score of 4,089. The iPhone 7 managed 5,600. Does that make the Pixel a slowcoach? No, and we’re wary of that unconfirmed benchmark, as the Galaxy S7 regularly scores over 5,000, and it uses a Snapdragon 820 chip. At this early stage, we can’t say either phone is faster than the other. However, we know the iPhone 7 is quick, and have no reason to think the Snapdragon 821 will be any different. Elsewhere, the Pixel comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and doesn’t have a MicroSD card slot, sadly. The iPhone 7 adds a 256GB option to the list, so if masses of storage are important to you (and you can stomach the extra cost), the Apple phone has a slight advantage here. Winner: Tie (pending further tests) Design This is ultimately going to come down to personal preference, but there are a few things you should keep in mind as you size the two up. The Pixel is made of metal, glass, and plastic. The glass panel on the rear provides the antenna with room to breathe, while the plastic sections recall manufacturer HTC’s Desire range of phones. It’s thin at 7.1mm and light at 143 grams. For the iPhone 7, Apple has blended in the antenna breaks more than on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, decluttering the rear panel, but keeping the camera bump. Google has avoided this by slightly enlarging the body itself. The iPhone 7’s body is made from aluminum, is 7.1mm thick, and a little lighter than the Pixel at 138 grams. In our hands-on, the Pixel is described as being, “high-end, not too heavy, or fragile, even with the half-glass back.” Concerns over the screen bezel are also unfounded, with it appearing larger in pictures than in real life. The iPhone 7 is extremely comfortable to hold, with wonderfully curved sides, and corners that nestle in the palm nicely. Arguably, the Pixel looks a lot like an iPhone, but this doesn’t really bother us — both are great looking phones. Google gives you the choice of a white, black, or limited edition blue Pixel, and it’s the blue that really catches the eye. The iPhone 7’s jet black color is the elusive limited edition for showoffs, and it’s the regular matte black that’s the winner, as it neatly conceals the antenna lines for a smooth look. Google’s phones have never been stunners, while the iPhone 7 has a class that the Pixel can’t quite match, supreme in-hand comfort, and a real premium build, which along with its lighter body and wider choice of colors sees it edge out the Pixel here. Winner: iPhone 7 Battery and audio Google has selected a 2,770mAh battery for the Pixel, complete with fast charging provided by the Snapdragon 821 and Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 feature. Plug it in using the USB Type-C cable and after 15 minutes it’ll be at 70 percent capacity. We’ve not used the phone for long enough to judge the overall use time on a daily basis. Inside the iPhone 7 is a 1,960mAh battery and in our review, we have seen 12 hours of solid use, and more than 40 percent left at the end of a day. There’s no fast charging though, and recharging the iPhone 7 will take longer than the Pixel. Neither phone has wireless charging as standard. The iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, and audio performance is vastly improved over the iPhone 6S while the Pixel has a single downward firing speaker. However, the Pixel retains a 3.5mm headphone socket, while Apple forces you to use headphones with a Lightning connector or Bluetooth. More battery capacity, faster charging, and a traditional headphone socket make the Pixel a clear winner. Winner: Google Pixel Display Looking at the numbers, the Pixel should run away here. The 5-inch display is an AMOLED panel, therefore producing deep blacks and strong colors. It has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution and a 441ppi pixel density, is covered in protective 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4, and Google claims it has an excellent viewing angle with little decrease in brightness. Related: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The iPhone’s Retina HD LED-backlit screen measures 4.7-inches, has a 1,334 x 750 pixel resolution for a 326ppi pixel density, and also a 2.5D piece of glass over the front. Although it has a lower resolution, it does still look great, but the Pixel’s AMOLED screen and higher pixel count will automatically make pictures, webpages, and games look better. However, there is one thing in the iPhone 7’s favor, and that’s 3D Touch, Apple’s pressure sensitive system. Here, additional functionality can be accessed with a harder screen press, and it’s surprisingly helpful, especially with iOS 10 installed. The Pixel doesn’t have this feature. Despite this, it’s as much a software feature as it is a display feature, giving the Pixel the win. Winner: Google Pixel Camera Let’s start with a spec shootout. The Pixel and the iPhone 7 both have 12-megapixel rear cameras. The Pixel has an f/2.0 aperture against the iPhone 7’s f/1.8 aperture, which should let in a little more light, plus it has a quad-LED flash rather than the Pixel’s dual-LED. However, while both have phase detection autofocus, laser autofocus only comes on the Pixel. Both have image stabilization, but only the iPhone uses traditional OIS, as the Pixel has a clever system that utilizes the phone’s gyroscope for smoothing out video. We’re big fans of the iPhone 7’s camera, although consider the iPhone 7 Plus to be the real winner, but have yet to really put the Pixel’s camera to the test. In our hands-on with the phone, we noted the speed with which it captured and processed photos, along with its low-light performance and cool HDR+ mode. The Pixel also has free, unlimited full resolution photo storage in the cloud through Google Photos, while you’ll have to pay for extra iCloud space or full-res Google Photos storage if you own an iPhone. Until we get our hands on the Pixel for a full review, we must turn to well-respected camera testers DxOMark, where the Pixel received an 89 rating, the highest of any smartphone yet. The iPhone 7 isn’t far behind with 86 though. It’s likely to be a tight contest between the iPhone 7 and the Pixel here, just like it is between the iPhone and the Galaxy S7, so we’re calling it a tie for now. Winner: Tie (Pending further tests) Durability Unless these phones are securely wrapped up in a case, neither are going to come off well in the event of a nasty fall. Glass and aluminum bodies aren’t designed to withstand much shock. It’s also worth mentioning that if you choose the jet black iPhone 7 and don’t wrap it in a case, expect it to gather up some scratches and scuffs pretty quickly. Apple knows the special finish is delicate, and recommends the use of a case. Apple now edges ahead of the Pixel here, having made the iPhone meet IP67 standards of splash, water, and dust resistance. We’ve tested this out, and the iPhone happily continues working after taking a bath, something the Pixel is unlikely to do even with its basic IP53 protection. Accidents happen, and if they involve the wet stuff, you’ll be glad it was the iPhone and not the Pixel underwater. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Software If design was a difficult category to judge, due to personal preference playing a considerable role, software is also subjective. Unlike pitting a phone like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 against the Pixel, Apple is prompt and regular with its software updates, which matches how Google will react with its new Pixel devices. The Pixel comes with Android 7.1 installed, the very latest version of the operating system, which can’t (and won’t) be found in this form anywhere else. The Apple iPhone has iOS 10. The two are very different, yet also quite alike. There are icons to tap, a virtual assistant to help — Assistant on the Pixel and Siri on the iPhone — and special messaging apps for both. On the Pixel, it’s Duo for video calls and Allo for chats, while on the iPhone there’s FaceTime and iMessage. Downsides of Google’s operating system don’t really apply here. It’s going to get regular updates, there’s no messy user interface over the top, and you’re assured of the latest version for at least a few years yet. Apple treats the iPhone in the same way. There’s little to choose between them when it comes to app stores either, with both being equally well stocked with apps, books, movies, and more. Winner: Tie Pricing and availability Wallets at the ready? They better be, because you’re going to have to open them pretty wide to get either one of these phones. Unlocked, without a contract, the Pixel will cost you $650 for the 32GB model or $750 for the 128GB, and it can be purchased directly through the Google Play Store. The iPhone 7 also costs $650 for the 32GB, $750 for the 128GB, and then $850 for the 256GB model. It can be bought through the Apple Store, either online or in a retail store. Contract prices vary for the iPhone, but it’s available with each major carrier in the U.S., while the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive. This hurts the Pixel here. We don’t like being forced onto one carrier and many people buy their phones in stores. However, there is good news for the Pixel: You can buy it unlocked from Google and get the same month-to-month financing you get with the iPhone at carriers. We’d suggest not buying either phone locked to a network, or fixed into a contract, anyway. There are financing options available for both the Pixel and the iPhone 7 through Google and Apple respectively too. However, be aware if you choose an iPhone on AT&T or Sprint with financing through Apple, it’ll be locked to that network. International buyers will also find it easier to buy an iPhone 7, with 25 countries on the list at launch, and more than 30 having been added since then. Others are coming in October. Google is only selling the Pixel in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany at the moment. Wider availability, more carrier options, and equal pricing sees the iPhone take this category. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Overall winner: iPhone 7 (for now) It’s three category wins for the iPhone 7, and two for the Pixel, with three overall ties. However, two of those sections will likely have a different result when we’ve played with the Pixel for a longer amount of time, so there’s still everything to play for. It’s interesting to see where the iPhone 7 beats the Google Pixel, particularly because durability and price have long been problem areas for Apple, and winners for Android phones. Apple has turned that around with the iPhone 7. The Pixel has it beaten when it comes to display, battery, and the presence of a 3.5mm headphone socket. Right now, because you can buy it in more places, with fewer restrictions, and it won’t stop working if it gets wet, the iPhone 7 has to take the win. Don’t dismiss the Pixel yet though, we’ve yet to test out two areas where it could very easily fight back and take the win. Check back soon.

Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Comes to Life With Google Tango Augmented Reality With augmented reality pegged as the next big thing in mobile apps, Google Tango will be a welcomed feature of the Phab 2 Pro smartphone. Here's how Tango separates the Phab 2 Pro from other smartphones. Google Tango Makes the Phab 2 Pro Interesting Support for Google Tango is the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro's main attraction. The feature is an augmented reality engine that uses the device's camera to see virtual elements over the real world. Better yet, Tango can measure objects and digitally visualize items and spaces to help users navigate in a house, factory or office. The Phab 2 Pro is the first smartphone to come with Tango, making it interesting to anyone interested in the future of augmented reality. The Display Is Huge To deliver a better Tango experience, Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro comes with a 6.4-inch screen. The display has a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 pixels and can adjust to variable lighting conditions so it can still work outside in direct sunlight. The Phab 2 Pro will ship with one of the best (and most attractive) smartphone displays on the market. Camera Technology Is Solid The Phab 2 Pro comes with a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera to complement its 8-megapixel front-facing camera. It also has a third camera on the back (its sensor size hasn't been revealed) that helps the smartphone render 3D images. If Tango takes off, expect more smartphones to come with a three-camera array—and for sensors to load up on megapixels. Snapdragon 652 Optimized for Augmented Reality The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, which has less power than the Snapdragon 820 and 821 chips users would find in other Android-based handsets. However, Lenovo was quick to note that the Snapdragon 652 has been optimized to work with Tango, which stands in stark contrast to other processors. So, while the Phab 2 Pro's processor might not be as high-powered as some of those in other Android devices, it's required to get the most out of Tango. It Has a High-Capacity Big Battery With Turbo Charging Lenovo has kept quiet about how long its Phab 2 Pro's battery can last on a single charge, but expect it to hold up quite well. The smartphone will ship with a 4,050mAh battery, one of the largest cells on the market. In addition, Lenovo says the battery will come with turbocharging so users can get back to work more quickly. There's a Fingerprint Sensor for Security Lenovo hasn't forgotten about security in the Phab 2 Pro and will offer a fingerprint sensor on the rear of the device. While the company hasn't said whether the smartphone will come with hardware-based encryption, a fingerprint scanner will at least make it more difficult for hackers to get into the smartphone or make unauthorized payments through Android Pay. Few Apps Are Currently Available Since the Phab 2 Pro is the first smartphone to support Tango, it's perhaps no surprise that the Google Play marketplace has only a few apps that support the smartphone. In fact, as of this writing, the marketplace has just a little more than 20 Tango-ready apps available, including some that focus solely on gaming, such as Castle Defender. But it's a start. Available Apps Are Appealing In addition to interesting gaming apps, there are a few Tango-ready programs that might actually appeal to corporate users. For instance, one app, Tango MeasureIt, lets users measure the distance between real-life objects. Another, Tango Constructor, lets developers record and view 3D models of their surroundings from the handset. As more apps come online, it's likely that devices running the Tango AR environment will gain greater support from business users. The Storage and Memory Should Suffice The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro ships with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. While more storage would be good, it's the RAM that counts here. With 4GB of RAM, the Phab 2 Pro should be able to handle augmented reality apps with ease and simultaneously support other Android functions. Less RAM, and the Phab 2 Pro likely wouldn't offer a suitable Tango experience. Putting the Pricing Into Perspective Lenovo hasn't set a specific delivery date in November for the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Whenever it hits store shelves, look for the Phab 2 Pro to come unlocked in the United States and sell for $499. To put that into perspective, most other high-end devices, including Apple's iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, start at $649. 10 Features Samsung Should Build Into the Galaxy S8 Smartphone View Slideshow » Why DNS Servers Are an Unprotected Back Door into Your Network View Slideshow » 11 Revolutionary Advances in Wireless Tech in 2016 View Slideshow » Panasonic Updates Toughpad FZ-G1 With More Power, Longer Battery Life View Slideshow » Broadcom, Qualcomm Latest Acquirers in Busy Chip Space View Slideshow » Why Donald Trump and Silicon Valley Don't See Eye to Eye View Slideshow » CIOs Expect Steady Growth in Health Care IT Spending, Cyber-Threats View Slideshow » Ransomware Takes Off, Web Browsers Under Attack: Kaspersky Report View Slideshow » TrueOS Succeeds PC-BSD Desktop-Friendly Unix OS View Slideshow » Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro View Slideshow » View All Slideshows >   Google Tango, an augmented reality technology that helps devices "see" the world around them, is soon coming to store shelves. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the first smartphone to run the Tango AR environment, is set to launch in November, Google has confirmed. The Phab 2 Pro was supposed to reach the market in the summer, but was pushed back twice—once to September and again to the "fall." Now that Lenovo's release plans have been revealed, it's time to take a closer look at the Phab 2 Pro. And at first glance, it seems like a winner. In addition to Tango support, which could appeal to consumers and enterprise users, the Lenovo smartphone comes with a 6.4-inch screen, three cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor optimized for Tango and ample storage. As time goes on and more AR apps come to the Google Play marketplace, the smartphone could prove even more useful. This slide show discusses the Phab 2 Pro's features and how the addition of AR technology makes the introduction of this smartphone so highly anticipated.                       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend                             Topics by Type Android Apple Cloud Database Developer Enterprise Apps Innovation IT Management   Mobile Networking PC Hardware Security Servers Small Business Storage Virtualization Articles by Type News & Analysis Slideshows Blogs Reviews Video   Contact Us About eWeek Sitemap Blogs Security Watch Upfront First Read Storage Station Careers Google Watch Special Features eWeekChat eWeek 30th Anniversary Cloud Backup Project Center Next Generation Firewall Project Center Big Data Analytics Project Center Research Center       Property of QuinStreet Enterprise.

Home, Google's new smart speaker, will be able to use voice to control Netflix and other video on Google's Chromecast streaming device. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Google is pretty serious about its plan to take over your home. The company on Tuesday offered more details on its smart speaker and home hub, Google Home, as an answer to Amazon's Echo speaker. But Google -- perhaps knowing that it's starting a little bit behind -- has been sure to hook the Home into Google's broader suite of services to make the concept of the smart home more affordable. Home will work with Google's Chromecast video and audio streaming devices -- $69 and $35, respectively -- so that customers can upgrade their current speakers and televisions with little fuss and not that much cash. When the whole system is in place, users can use their voices to call up YouTube videos on their televisions or ask for a specific song to play through their non-Google speakers. Home itself will also be able to play music. And the Google Assistant built into the speaker has been designed to be able to find the track you want even if you aren't sure of its name. On stage, Google Home was able to correctly pull up the song "Try Everything" by Shakira, after being asked to play "the Shakira song from 'Zootopia'" -- a way of phrasing the query that could sound incomprehensible to a computer that can't tap into the wider world of Google's information. Home is also designed to work with third-party apps, so it will be able to control some smart light bulb systems such as Philips Hue. Google has also worked out partnerships with some services -- including Uber, meaning users can order a car by voice. And the hub has a mute button, if consumers aren't comfortable having the device always listening for the trigger phrase, "Ok, Google." Home comes in six shades -- copper, snow, carbon, mango, marine and violet -- and costs $129. It will be available at the Google Store, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target starting Oct. 20 and is available for pre-order immediately. The company also announced a new system of routers, called Google Wi-Fi. It's a pack of smaller routers that work together, rather than a single router that plugs into your modem. This should help eliminate "dead spots" in your house, by letting you place them more widely throughout your home. It will cost $129 for a single router and $299 for a three-pack. It will be available for pre-order in November at the Google Store, Amazon, Best Buy and Wal-Mart.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile App News / Google finally realises no-one wants to Hangout on Android Google finally realises no-one wants to Hangout on Android by Chris Smith 07 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Remember when everyone used to meet up for a good old chinwag in Google Hangouts? No, neither do we. Reports on Friday revealed Google is willing to cast off its largely unloved universal chat app in favour of the new and improved Duo video calling app. Google is no longer requiring Android phone makers to include Hangouts on their Google Mobile Services-approved phones. Its place will be taken by Duo, per AndroidPolice sources. Related: Google Pixel hands-on - the ultimate small phone? “Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016,” Google told hardware makers. Hangouts, which includes instant messaging, voice and group video chatting will be relegated to an optional extra for manufacturers and will remain available via the Play Store. Interestingly, although Duo will be a mandatory inclusion for Android phone-makers down the line, the Allo chat app, powered by Google Assistant, will not. As the original source points out, Allo has a huge number of competitors in the field, namely Facebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp. See also: Google Allo tips and tricks With that in mind, it is strange Google wouldn’t give it a leg up by ensuring it arrives on all Android Phones, so perhaps this will change in future.

Because Allo is useless and nobody video chats every convo. John October 7, 2016, 7:39 pm The headline is click bait. Google has simply stopped *requiring* manufacturers supply hangouts.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Google starts big advertising push around new Pixel phone By Reuters Published: 14:06 EST, 7 October 2016 | Updated: 14:06 EST, 7 October 2016 e-mail By Jessica Toonkel and Julia Love Oct 7 (Reuters) - Google's new "Pixel" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc . Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL Smartphones – Things Everyone Should Know About the Phones By AdminOctober 7, 2016 Newest No Comments 0 0 0 October 14th 2016  – Google unleashed the new information about its first ever smartphone PIXEL and PIXEL XL – the next step in Google’s in-house hardware development. Google markets the phones as a strictly in-house operation, despite HTC constructing the phones. Pixel costs same as much as the other new phones  The price of the pixel starts at $649 same as the new I Phone 7 and it is slight cheaper than the samsung S7 at $670 Google announced that the pre-order of Pixel and Pixel XL smart phones start at October 13th in India and it will be also available in small retailers and Flipkart, Reliance Digital and croma. Google Pixel Price                   India                 US  Google Pixel 32GB                   57000               $649 Google Pixel 128GB                 66000               $749 Google Pixel XL 32GB              67000               $769 Google Pixel XL 128GB            76000               $869 It has the best camera of any smartphone Google proudly touted this fact in most of the Pixel’s marketing. DxOMark gave the camera a score of 89, the highest in the industry. Apple’s iPhone 7 scores at 86. The camera boasts blur reduction, stabilizers, fisheye panoramas, and “photosphere” capabilities. The Pixel Smartburst feature allows users to take photos in rapid succession so as to not miss any of the action. Google Assistant keeps your life together Pixel is the first phone to feature Google Assistant built into the programming (duh, since it’s a Google phone). The Assistant can access photos from both personal storage and the internet. The Assistant translates across devices and into the Google Home system. Holding the Pixel’s home button activates the assistant. With the entire power of Google’s search engine, the assistant can access pretty much everything users need. It offers unlimited photo and video storage for its devices. Included with the phone is free unlimited storage for high-resolution images and video. The storage even takes off size limitations and compression issues users currently experience uploading to Google Photos. Google Pixel specifications The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, with two cores clocked at 1.6GHz, and two cores clocked at 2.15GHz. Both the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will pack 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and sport Pixel imprint fingerprint sensor. They sport a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with a Sony IMX378 sensor, PDAF, a large f/2.0 aperture, and 1.55-micron pixels. Both sport an 8-megapixel front camera with a Sony IMX179 sensor, an f/2.4 aperture, and 1.4-micron pixels.

The change is bound to be confusing for some users: When Google first introduced its Chromecast streaming adapter in 2013, it also released a Chromecast-branded companion app for iOS and Android that could be used to install and configure the device. Earlier this year, the company changed the app’s name to “Google Cast” in a nod to the fact that there are now numerous other devices that support Google’s cast technology, including TVs from Vizio and Wifi-connected speakers from LG, Sony and other companies. Now, the company is rebranding the app again, and simply calling it Google Home. Consumers will be able to use the app to “discover new content and manage (their) Google Home assistant and Cast devices,” according to Google. Google officially launched Google Home as its answer to Amazon’s Echo smart speaker earlier this week. During a press event in San Francisco, a Google employee showed that Google Home owners will be able to use the new app to select sources for their daily news briefing, connect to other devices around the home and more. Google Home and Chromecast aren’t just using the same smart phone app. Google Home is also based on Cast technology, which will allow owners of the device to send media to their TV or Wifi-connected stereo systems around the home with simple voice commands.

(Reuters/Mark Blinch) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging October 07, 2016 Becoming internet-famous may seem quick and easy, but it certainly doesn’t come cheap. José Javier, a 12-year-old trumpet player in Spain, decided to promote his band, Los Salerosos, through his YouTube channel—and found himself stuck with a €100,000 ($112,000) bill from Google, El País reported (link in Spanish). The schoolboy had signed up for Google AdWords, thinking that he would earn money every time someone clicked on his ad (as users can with Google’s AdSense program). Little did he know that it is the ad’s creator who foots the bill under AdWords’ “pay-per-user” program, which gives publishers the means to pay for priority placements of ads on the site. It’s apparently a common enough confusion that Google has a page explaining the difference between AdWords and AdSense. For the aspiring YouTube star from Valencia’s Torrevieja region, this was an expensive mistake: It only took a couple of months, mid-August to early October, to rack up the astronomical bill. His mother, Inma Quesada, was caught off guard when the family’s bank raised red flags about a €19,700 charge from Google in early September. Javier’s parents put a block on the account, but that didn’t stop the search engine giant from billing another €78,000. Quesada told El País that Javier was able to set up the Google AdWords account by giving just the name and account number of the savings account his family had set up for future costs like his driving license. Luckily for the young Spaniard, Google investigated the curious case after reports surfaced in the local media. Recognizing his youthful mistake, they wrote off the entire amount on Wednesday (Oct. 5). “We have not received any monies from this user and we are canceling the outstanding AdWords balance,” a Google spokesperson told Quartz. AdWords, like many of the company’s online services, has age limits restricting its use, but the company made a one-off concession this time to cancel the bill. The spokesperson recommended that families look to Google’s Safety Center page for families to prevent their kids from making such errors.

Google has an impressive record on renaming, so these moves are nothing new. The fact that the rebranding confuses the workers who need the tools doesn't seem to slow the name game down. Google Apps for Work also got a new moniker. Now called the G Suite, it pulls together Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Hangouts and other productivity tools. Previous names of this group of apps reads like a tech version of the name game: Google Apps, Google Apps for Work and Google Apps for Your Domain and now, G Suite. New, 'Smarter' G Suite Functionality While Google has been talking about the rebranding for a number of weeks now, it never explained why or if any additional apps would come with the new name. Currently the rebranding exercise is being regarded as exactly that — a rebranding exercise. While no new apps were included, G Suite does come with new functionality, which fall under the following categories — all with the prefix ‘smarter’: Storage Scheduling Spreadsheets Presentations Documents Drive for teams Meetings for teams In a blog post about the name change and improvements, Prabhakar Raghavan, vice president Apps, Google Cloud wrote: “Google has been driving machine intelligence research for over a decade. A year ago, Smart Reply launched, offering auto-generated replies for emails that only need a quick response. Now, more than 10 percent of all replies on mobile are sent using Smart Reply. The reception has been so strong that we're continuing to apply machine intelligence across our suite to solve customer problems.” The response has been generally positive, with some noting the enhanced collaboration features across the suite. Ragahavan cited research which found workers spend up to three work days on mundane tasks like emailing, scheduling and attending meetings and gathering information, and only two days doing what they were hired to do. G Suite, he writes, will “help employees reclaim their time and come together as teams on strategic and creative projects so they can better serve their customers.” The new functionality will become available over the coming weeks and months. AIIM Underlines Paper Problems Recently released research from Silver Spring, Md.-based Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM) shows paper is still clogging up the enterprise. The results shouldn't come as a surprise. Over the past 10 years report after report from organizations like AIIM and Gartner have underscored the difficulties organizations face when moving to paperless environments. AIIM released the findings in advance of the Nov. 4 observation of World Paper Free Day (WPFD). The research does indicate that significant progress has been made in the ongoing move towards a paper-free office. The research also shows a steady drop in the amount of paper entering the organization for 44 percent of respondents and a rapid drop for 9 percent. The "Paper-Free in 2016, Are We There Yet?" report is a result of an August survey of 199 members of the AIIM community. “The once elusive concept of paper-free business operations is today a real possibility and real progress has been made over the past 12 months. It remains unrealistic to think that all business processes and transactions will be paper-free in the near future, but there are definitely certain processes where paper can be removed,” Bob Larrivee, chief analyst at AIIM said in a statement. It points to a number of processes and business functions that have been particularly effective in reducing the use of paper, notably human resources and recruitment (49 percent). Other areas include: Employee lifecycle (48 percent) Accounts Payables (41 percent) Accounts Receivables (39 percent). But at the end of the day, people and their paper-loving ways remains the main problem. Note taking (47 percent) and lack of C-Suite initiatives (47 percent) are the biggest offenders, while 39 percent said they weren’t aware of paper free options.  M-Files Research Confirms Paper Problems The AIIM report findings were confirmed by research from Dallas-based M-Files, which also appeared in the past week. The results show 81 percent of the hundreds of workers surveyed online by M-Files are carrying out at least one print job per day. More importantly, it also shows that more than half of all organizations (55 percent) are still using manual paper-based processes for capturing signatures for documents that require approval. The good news here is that a similar number of respondents (55 percent) said the organization they work in is actively trying to reduce the dependency on paper. "Managing paper documents is inconvenient and expensive. Turning paper documents into digital files leads to a substantial increase in efficiency and reduced operational costs. It's really past time for companies to move beyond paper documents and bulky file cabinets as the default approach for managing important business documents,” Greg Milliken, vice president of marketing at M-Files Corporation, said in a statement.  OpenText Upgrades Exstream Waterloo, Ontario-based OpenText released the latest version of OpenText Exstream which, according to the company, will help organizations with digital transformation projects. OpenText acquired Exstream as part of its HP buy back in June and folded the software into its Customer Experience Management suite. The updated Exstream provides personalized, consistent, anytime/anywhere communications across channels and content forms including interactive charts, perform controlled in-context editing, and better PDF management. With this update, users can create mobile-ready content for HTML email output which incorporate responsive features. The in-context editing is particularly useful here for workers building and editing documents for email, PDFs or print The update also provides internal support for internal PDF hyperlinks and page dictionaries, while the dictionary indexing allows for dynamically importing HTML with formatted text, tables, images and variable content.  Title image "Hello My Name Is" (CC BY 2.0) by Photographing Travis 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Kentico’s New Cloud CMS Is Headless, Thoughtful and Affordable Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Domo Strikes New Low in Vendor Competition Everything You Thought You Knew About User Experience Is Wrong 5 Places Where Social Collaboration Tools Help Business Processes Digital Hub Platforms Can Improve Enterprise Collaboration Microsoft Connects SharePoint Team Sites to Office 365 Groups 3 Things to Know Before You Hire Across State Lines Microsoft Teams Takes Aim at Slack, Other Collaboration Vendors Useful Article?

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Captcha Does Not Block Pokemon Go Scanners, New Encryption Does Posted: Oct 7 2016, 10:30am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Oct 8 2016, 12:50am CDT, in News | Technology News   Credit: Google   Niantic deployment of Google's reCaptcha is not stopping 3rd party developers from scraping Pokemon Go servers. Update: Niantic deployed new encryption blocking all Pokemon scanners and bots. Pokemon Go is putting the spotlight on how weak widely used security technology really is. Niantic has enlisted Google security technology to block 3rd party developers from accessing Pokemon Go servers and extract the valuable location of spawning Pokemon. In addition to that, Niantic also relies on Google's SafetyNet to block the Pokemon Go app from running on rooted devices. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals Update: Niantic has released a new encryption of the protocol blocking all scrapers. It is not just Captcha now the 3rd party developers such as the creator of FastPokeMap have to deal with now. It is another reverse engineering job. They need to find out how the new encryption works before any Pokemon Go scanner or bot is going to work again. This can take days. Both security technologies can be circumvented. Running apps on rooted devices that require SafetyNet verification as been possible before Pokemon Go. Before solutions that hide rooted have been known by relatively small group, now millions more use these techniques so they can run Pokemon on their rooted smartphone.  This attention and wide spread forces Google to improve their security technology. This happened earlier this week with SafetyNet. Solutions like Magisk stopped working. This changed has not just affected Pokemon Go trainers, but anyone who was running Magisk for instance to use Android Pay on rooted phone. There are already methods to circumvent the new improved SafetyNet and Magisk is getting an update that will deal with the changes. This means there will be another round of SafetyNet changes coming soon. Google can't give up the fight. Business partners including banks will come down on them. They already will have increased the pressure on Google.     The situation with reCaptcha is no different. Yesterday we reported that FastPokeMap, the largest Pokemon scanner, is going to fold, but things already changed. The creator of FastPokeMap found a viable solution to deal with the Captcha. First he increased the number of worker accounts significantly from the 500,000 the service used. This reduces the number of captchas FPM triggers. Yesterday they still had 10,000 captchas per second. Secondly, they made a deal with a Captcha solving service to solve the captchas they hit. The end solution is to redirect the captchas to the 15 million daily users of FastPokeMap. This is not trivial and will take some hacking. Captcha solver and captcha solving services have been around since a long time, but now they get a lot of attention becaues of Pokemon Go. Not just large scale scanners have to deal with captchas. Anybody who is running a personal scanner or bot needs to deal with them and they do with similar methods as FPM. The fact that you can circumvent Google's reCaptcha with a "earn money online" service scheme makes Google look bad. Pokemon Go is going to make the web more secure by forcing Google to make its security solutions better. Banking and online payment services should lead that charge and not a game.

Rogers has also introduced a worry free data management tool that allows the telecom’s customers to assert control over their data usage. Will control be the key to customers being comfortable spending more on their phone bills? Tune in to hear the SyrupCast team’s thoughts.

Smanny As far as why they made the Pixel with a big chin is exactly for symmetry. You guys didn’t even mention anything about the Pixels Daydream VR. It has to sit in a VR headset, so the screen has to be in the middle, and the headset needs to hold onto something. Plus Samsung has their own Gear VR and they are partnered with Oculus. Google started the whole mobile VR back in 2013 with their Cardboard. They needed someone to showcase their Daydream VR. So that is what the Pixel is exactly doing. Not to mention showcase their new camera software which uses the same VR sensors for image stabilization. They are using the fastest gyroscope and accelerometer sensors on any smartphone. A tech blog was saying that they can acquire 200 samples per second, which brings down latency and improves image stabilization, plus those sensors help out in VR as well. This time Google had to take the matters into their own hands. Because the software needed to have specific hardware, cpu, gpu, and sensors as well. Does anyone think that Google honestly wants to see any fragmentation. Absolutely not. You have to remember that if an OEM keeps updating a device for the next 5 years. They they will be loosing money, especially if you only paid $200 for a device (purchased outright). Mawhayden Interest in the Phone not the VR, VR will come 1st to the home,VR mobile is it really ready…maybe in5 years but not now. Smanny It certainly won’t be 5 years from now. VR is here today, and especially in mobile. The mobile processors today already can handle VR. From games to education, to movies, and videos. For instance the PS VR can and does already work perfectly for two displays (TV and VR headset). The mobile versions only needs to worry about feeding one display, only. The reason why the newer PS/4 is going to be 4 teraflops is so it can support multiple VR headsets simultaneously. Mobile devices (smartphones) will never have to worry about driving more than one display. Mawhayden Nah, I will pass, I will leave those toys to the “Younglings, I will choose 5G Technologies, Fibre Tech, advanced materials and advanced Mesh Networks, I willleave VR to you,you are more interested in this than I am have fun though. Not for you Nice to hear a discussion about the impacts on new services due to the lack of diversity amongst those who build them.

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

In its place, the company will instead include Duo, its recently released FaceTime competitor for instant video chatting. Hangouts isn't totally going away. It will remain an optional member of the Google Mobile Services package, which Google requires manufacturers to install so consumers have integral services like the Chrome browser and Google Maps. However, the demotion means Hangouts will have significantly less visibility among new phone buyers if companies do decide to leave it out. This does not mean manufacturers will decide to leave Hangouts wallowing in the Play Store. The app could very well make its way onto Android handsets for many months to come. And the app will be available for download even if it is left out of the GMS suite — that is until Google decides to shutter it. Still, the move is a telling one from the search giant, which has moved aggressively to promote Duo and its new artificial intelligence-powered chat app Allo. It's a bit of a strange move that Allo won't be a mandatory app in the GMS suite, as Android Police points out, but it could be included down the line. Right now, it's clear Google wants to promote video chatting above all else.

First, the recoveries have started and Google confirmed it should be done fairly soon, probably next few days. The recoveries thus far look very impressive. Early on, our polls showed that the recoveries were not but that has changed. Google says you should keep on using the disavow file even though Google devalues with Penguin versus demotes. Google paid $100,000 for a link from Apache.org, nah but still funny. Google said negative SEO still not a concern for them. Google said directories are not the right way to build links. Google said 301 redirecting all your old pages to your home page will result in them being a soft 404. Google showed off the Google Home and Assistant and how they handle featured snippets is way cool. Most SEOs want an intrusive ad interstitial penalty tool from Google. Google is testing an advanced verification method for Google My Business. Google is displaying more images in the mobile results. Google AdWords updated their mobile apps. Google AdWords Editor upgraded to version 11.6. Google AdSense launched a new design for their ad units. Google Analytics is working on the referrer spam issue.

In Google Maps 4.23 for iOS, you can now upload photos along with your reviews of places and see descriptions of places including features, atmosphere and amenities. This is what the old Google Maps widgets looked like. And here they are in all their iOS 10 glory. On the “Nearby Transit” widget, any transit station can be expanded to show more information regarding your available transit options. The “Travel Times” widget shows the estimated drive time to your Home and Work locations, like before. You can update your Home and Work locations inside Google Maps for iOS or on the web. Most of the stock apps in iOS 10 now have widgets. Previously available through the Notification Center’s Today section, widgets in iOS 10 show up on the Lock screen and Home screen 0 and inside of the Notification Center. Widgets in iOS 10 use the light, blurred background provided by the system for consistency and legibility. Google Maps is a free download from the App Store.

All IOS needs now is Finder and I’ll be completely satisfied. AMB_07 I really would like a file system on my iphone. It doesn’t have to give you root access (for obvious reasons) but at least a basic one with a download folder for any file downloaded off safari etc. Rowan09 Yes iFile is one of my favorites Chris iOS is a file system, what you want is a file explorer which is Finder. nova voter along the same lines, the Maps Destinations widget for Apple Maps kinda sucks. Great concept, but it never actually shows me the next destination in my calendar. Unless I’m misunderstanding the point of the widget. JohnS Am I the only one that likes the look of those first screenshots better? Personally I much prefer that frosted glass look to that harsh gray pallet. Sohail Wahab I like that look too, I don’t know Micke på taket Google maps is a joke here in sweden ,, so outdated maps.. The Zlatan Personally I prefer to use Sarajevo for my public transportation screenshots, but that’s just me.. techfreak23 That white is so ugly. Really hope they come out with a dark mode in 10.2 because the white is annoying and burns my eyes at night even with night shift on with low brightness. PhoneTechJay Do you wear glasses?

more_vert androidAndroid App facebookFacebook gplusGoogle + twitterTwitter youtubeYouTube rssRSS Feed search close android facebook gplus twitter youtube rss whatshotNews starsReviews phone_androidPhones tabletTablets appsApps gamesGames network_cellCarriers forumForums attach_moneyDeals Download the App Our Team Tip Us Drippler ruins app with “Digital Assistant” update (and 2 alternatives to download) +6,636 Rob Jackson Oct 7th, 2016 Drippler users updating to version 3.0 will be gravely disappointed in the app’s direction as the company has adopted a Google Assistant style chatbot, nicknamed “Wiz”, for all your tech support needs. There are just two main problems: Wiz doesn’t seem to know a dang thing You’re then asked to “buy” a monthly package for better support No thanks, Drippler! If you miss Drippler’s curated Android news, try downloading EarlyBird – News for Android. And if you’re looking for tech support for your phone and apps/games (without paying monthly for a hipster chatbot), download Channels – Forums for Android. Both apps are owned by our parent company, Neverstill Media. We have been fans of Drippler in the past, but the latest update showcases a few dangerous moves any tech company can make. Blindly Chasing Trends At the Google Pixel event, Sundar Pichai said that the future has moved from “mobile” to “artificial intelligence”, a way to explain the company’s love affair with their new product- Google Assistant. Drippler’s “Tech Assistant” feels like a carbon copy knockoff, personalized with a cartoony mascot to make it seem like you’re talking to an actual entity. The problem? Google is home to the world’s largest treasure chest of information, has the largest and smartest team of engineers to systematically unlock that information, and even Google’s product feels somewhat elementary. Ask “Giz” almost anything and you feel like you’re talking to a wall. This achieves the opposite of the intended effect… but it gets worse. Following the money It seems Drippler already had a solid monetization strategy, infusing tech-focused sponsored stories into their news feed. They were non-intrusive, fit the theme of the app, jived with the interest of readers, and seemed to work well. Management and angel investors must not have liked the results, seeking additional revenue in the form of premium monthly subscriptions. That’s a great idea and potentially lucrative idea, in theory, but Drippler messed up by pushing the new feature too hard, too fast. Over Promise, Under Deliver You know the old adage, “Under promise, over deliver,” right? The new Drippler does just the opposite. You’re introduced to the app with a wonderfully simple onboarding process that claims the app will fulfill all your tech needs, but when you start asking questions, you’re pushed to a sales pitch every. single. time. Update: it seems Drippler has temporarily buried the option for Premium Subscriptions due to extremely negative feedback, including a flood of 1-star Google Play Store Reviews and articles like this. Most successful subscription services work because the user gets something free and enjoys it so much, they want more and are willing to pay for it. In Drippler’s case, the subscription is shrouded in the uncertainty of a self-proclaimed groundbreaking digital genius-bot who seems to know nothing, so for what exactly are you paying? Nobody knows… and so nobody will. The Alternatives We hope Drippler returns to their trusty blue driplet, but until/unless they do, you may be looking for a go to source for Android News and Android Help. Thankfully, we’ve been working hard on 2 new apps that deliver these specific solutions. Android News – (EarlyBird) This app is like the Tinder of Android News, with community voting to create a trending news list, and the ability to follow specific topics and get notifications for any related updates. It’s been getting continually high praise on the Google Play Store and shows no signs of slowing down. Download EarlyBird Android Help – Channels This app will automatically detect your phone and the apps and games you’ve got on it, creating discussion forums for each so you can have conversations with like-minded device owners and users. Start conversations, get notifications of replies, and get the most out of Android through 1-on-1 discussions about everything from support and troubleshooting, to tips and tricks, to product and accessory reviews and suggestions. Download ChannelsWe hope you enjoy these two apps and Drippler team – if you’re listening – please drop the Tech Assistant and return to your roots! Take Our Poll Have you downloaded the Drippler update, EarlyBird, and/or Channels? Love them or hate them?

Why it matters: Google Assistant is important because it is the linchpin in Google's AI-first strategy for the future, and will likely come to define how users interact with almost all of Google's core products. Who does it affect: Consumers who are invested in the Google ecosystem will be affected by this, as will other smartphone manufacturers who may be prompted to create or acquire their own competing AI product. When is this happening: Google Assistant was first unveiled at the 2016 Google I/O developer conference in May 2016, and it will be first available on some products in fall 2016. It will likely come to more devices and platforms in the future. How to take advantage of Google Assistant: Currently, Google Assistant will be exclusive to the Google Pixel phone in terms of smartphones, but it also being previewed as part of Google's smart chat app, Allo, and will also integrate with Google Home. What it is Google Assistant is a voice-activated personal digital assistant, first introduced by Google at the 2016 I/O conference in California. Much like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, or Microsoft's Cortana, the Google Assistant provides contextual information and performs actions such as booking a restaurant reservation or sending a message on behalf of the user.

To perform its functions, Google Assistant relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning to understand what the user is saying, and to make suggestions or act on that language input. Google Assistant is the foundational piece of Google's "AI-first" strategy that CEO Sundar Pichai recently discussed at a Made by Google event. Before Google Assistant, Google created another digital assistant software known as Google Now. And, while Google Now is still in operation, there are some subtle differences between the two platforms. Google Now operates within an app available on Android or iOS, while Google Assistant is currently exclusive to certain products like Google Allo and the Google Pixel phone. As CNET's Sarah Jacobsson Purewal pointed out, Google Assistant can perform all of the actions that Google Now can, but it is more conversational and uses a deeper level of AI. The goal of Google Assistant, Pichai previously said, is to "build a personal Google for each and every user." Google Assistant will eventually be the connective tissue among all of Google's core software and hardware products.

As noted above, Google believes that, just as the tech world moved from web to mobile, the next stage in that evolution is to move from mobile to AI. As hardware becomes more commoditized, smartphone manufacturers must compete on what they can provide through next-generation software and AI. Not only that, but they also must build out an ecosystem of products and devices that share access to this AI. Google Assistant will be embedded in the new Google Pixel phone, but it also works in its smart chat app, Allo, and is a key part of its smart home hub, Google Home. Other companies are following a similar trajectory. Samsung recently purchased Viv Labs and plans on embedding conversational interfaces in its devices and home appliances. Microsoft put Cortana in the Xbox One, and Apple is working on integrating Siri into more of its products as well.

(ZDNet) Google's spruced-up digital assistant wants to chat you up (CNET) Who does this affect? The advent of Google Assistant, first and foremost, affects consumers in the Google ecosystems. Smartphone users who purchase a Pixel phone, or smart home fans who install a Google Home hub, will be able to use Google Assistant to stay more connected and automate many parts of their daily lives. Developers will also be affected by Google Assistant, as it opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for AI-powered services. In fact, Google announced that it will be releasing an Embedded Google Assistant SDK, aimed at hardware vendors and developers who can find new integrations for the technology. Other smart home product manufacturers will also be affected by Google Assistant, as it adds another major player to the market. Amazon Alexa, despite its strong lead with the Amazon Echo and Dot, will likely face major competition in home automation from Google Home as the ecosystem is built out.

Google first announced Google Assistant in May 2016 at the 10th annual Google I/O developer event at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. In September 2016, one of the first previews of Google Assistant came with the launch of Google Allo, the smart messaging app. The first phone that will take advantage of Google Assistant, the Google Pixel phone, was unveiled on October 4, 2016. That same day it opened for preorders, and is expected to arrive in stores by October 20, 2016. Google Home, which also utilized Google Assistant, is also now available for preorder, and is expected to ship on November 4, 2016.

SUBSCRIBE Exploring a newly granted Google patent around social signals Columnist Dave Davies takes a deep dive into a recently published Google patent for clues on how the search giant is thinking about social signals and search results. Dave Davies on October 7, 2016 at 11:41 am More Disclaimer: When discussing patents, it’s important to remember that simply filing a patent does not mean a technology is in use or will ever be used. It is simply a strong indication that an idea is being considered and likely tested. Every now and then, a patent comes across my radar that gets me excited, and one granted recently to Google fits that bill perfectly. We’re heard repeatedly from Google that social interactions are not a search ranking signal.  In fact, you can read a Tweet from Google’s Gary Illyes in response to the statement, “Some controversy over whether Google takes social into account for SEO …” His reply: @RicardoBlanco take a look at this video. https://t.co/zPKuZRNaoy The short version is, no, we don't@louisgray @PRNews @JohnMu — Gary Illyes (@methode) June 7, 2016 So the answer is “No,” right? Maybe, and here’s where it gets interesting. Understanding that the folks at Google tend to give answers that are technically correct but not always in the spirit of the question asked, we can hear what’s being said as, “Social is not taken into account as a direct signal when determining the rankings.” This is very different from not being a signal at all, for reasons we’ll illustrate shortly. Another aspect of Google search that we need to be constantly aware of is that RankBrain now applies to all queries. Essentially, this means that artificial intelligence (AI) is interpreting all queries to some degree. While at this time the AI implementation revolves more around using machine learning to understand the nature of the query (and likely type of content and format being sought), its rollout to all queries and the promotion of John Giannandrea to Head of Search at Google marks the push into AI control over larger portions of the Google algorithm. “Why does this matter?” you might ask. The answer is that once machine learning and AI influence sections of the ranking algorithm — and not just the query interpretation — there will forever be factors and functions and results that not even the engineers at Google can fully determine. The answers Google gives will no longer be based on an actually conclusive understanding of what’s going on, but rather a better-than-average guess — and the exact factors and their weights won’t be fully known. I mention these things to wrap context around the patent we’ll now discuss. Google was recently granted patent US 2016/0246789 A1 titled, “Searching Content Of Prominent Users In Social Networks.” If it sounds incredibly interesting, that’s because it is. Good! Let’s get started. To keep things clear, I’m going to go through some of the key points and sections of the patent. I’ll begin with what they’ve written and immediately follow that with my interpretation of what it means in real English, then discuss any implications for SEOs. The abstract The abstract of a patent is essentially the outline of what it covers. They wrote: Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage medium, for receiving a query; retrieving one or more social restricts associated with the user, the one or more social restricts comprising a set of author-based query restricts; generating an augmented query based on the query and the set of author-based query restricts; obtaining a set of social search results that are responsive to the augmented query, each social search result in a first sub-set of the set of social search results being associated with an author-based document restrict that corresponds to an author-based query restrict in the set of author-based query restricts; and providing the social search results for display to the user. What it means: Essentially, what they’re stating in the abstract is that this is a patent for the “methods, systems, and apparatus” for the following steps: Receive a query from a user. Retrieve for that user an adjusted set of results based on social connections and what those connections write, share, post and so on. Adjust the initial user query based on these social adjustments. Display a search result based in part on the initial query and adjusted based on social conditions. Basically, they’re talking about taking into account what your friends and connections are doing and augmenting your search results based on it. Before we move on, there is a term used frequently in the patent which could use some clarification. They use the word “restricts” often in reference to both authors and queries. In this context, they are referring to the restricting of the referenced/ranked content based on either the authors/social connections and queries to those impacted by a social condition. To put it in a more everyday application, using Google Maps would “restrict” the results to those companies/sites where Google knows a physical location for them. Section 7 They wrote: … adding a respective author-based query restrict to the set of author-based query restricts; actions further include: identifying a plurality of prominent users that the user is connected … for each of the one or more prominent users in the set of prominent users, adding a respective author-based query restrict … receiving a plurality of scores, each score being associated with a respective prominent user … the score includes a prominence score that reflects a relative prominence of a respective prominent user within the one or more computer-implemented services; the score is based on a number of followers of the respective prominent user within the one or more computer-implemented services … the author-based document restrict is associated with the prominent user … the resource being associated with a social search result in the social search results … the author user has at least a threshold number of relationships with other users … the relationships include asymmetric relationships … the user-based query restrict is specific to the user; the user-based document restrict reflects that an author user distributed a resource associated with a respective social search result to the user using one or more computer-implemented services; the one or more social restricts further comprise a user-based query restrict …  the one or more social restricts are associated with a social graph of the user, the social graph reflecting relationships between the user and other users of one or more computer-implemented services. This is probably the most varied section of the patent, with a wide range of important points, so let’s cover each worthwhile bit of verbiage in point form: What it means: Google will index social content and determine the prominent users to which the searcher is connected. For those prominent users, Google will generate a query restrict (that is, an augmented search result based on that prominent user and their actions). For each prominent user, a score will be generated. This score will be based in part on their prominence in the searcher’s social circles, their number of followers and so on. The prominent user may need to have a minimum number of followers or global influence to have a good score (think of links in traditional SEO). The restricts (or adjustments) will be specific to the person searching. The queries may take into account the full social graph of the searcher. Section 16 They wrote: … enhancing serving of resources that are published by prominent users using one or more computer-implemented services … Implementations of the present disclosure are further directed to augmenting queries submitted by searching users to discover resources that are published by prominent users … a resource can be identified as a potential social search result when an author-based document restrict associated with the resource matches an author-based query restrict appended to the query. What it means: In section 16, we see that the goal of the restricts is to provide to the searcher a set of results that enhances or raises the results that prominent users in their social graph (read: people they engage with often or who are otherwise influential) have previously shared, written or otherwise engaged with. Section 26 They wrote: … a social graph can refer to a single social graph or multiple interconnected social graphs … Each social graph can include edges to additional individuals or entities at higher degrees of separation from the user. What it means: What Google is covering here is that they may take into account a single social network or multiple social networks and that the graph may extend past immediate connections to augment search results based on connections outside those that are direct. Section 27 They wrote: … user mail or chat contact, direct contacts on social sites … the social graph includes content generated by individuals (e.g., social networking posts, blog posts, reviews) as connections to the user. What it means: The scope of the social graph is not simply traditional social sites but all things that could be considered social.  This includes email, chat programs, blog posts, review sites and so on.  One might even think that their own product, Allo, could be considered a vehicle to gain connection information. Section 31 They wrote: … the membership and degree of separation in the social graph is based on other factors, including a frequency of interaction … respective weights can be associated with nodes and/or edges, and a degree of separation between users can be determined based on the weights. What it means: In section 31, we read Google’s recognition of making adjustments to the restricts based on factors such as the degree of separation from the searcher (i.e., how closely they are acquainted) and the frequency with which they interact. Section 38 They wrote: … the user’s profile also identifies other aliases used by the user …  For example, a user may have a first identity for a chat application and a second identity for a restaurant review web site. These two identities can be linked together in order to unify the content associated with that user. What it means: This section doesn’t really need translation; Google will try to connect different user profiles, and if they can, they will use this connection to add further weight to the searcher’s interests and social graph. Section 41 They wrote: Identified content associated with the user’s social graph can include, for example, content or posting to resources subscribed to by the user (e.g., particular blogs). The identified information can also include content generated by members of the user’s social graph. For example, members of a user’s social graph can generate content including, for example, local reviews (e.g., for restaurants or services), video reviews and ratings, product reviews, book reviews, blog comments, news comments, maps, public web annotations, public documents, streaming updates, photos and photo albums. What it means: In this section, we see the capability to augment search results not just based on what is shared or engaged with by members of a searcher’s social graph, but also what is created by them. They use examples such as restaurant reviews and long-form content like blogs and photos. Section 48 They wrote: In some implementations, the presentation and ranking of search results associated with the user’s social graph is adjusted by one or more factors including one or more social signals. For example, affinity can be used to determine whether to show content from a particular member of the user’s social graph or whether to promote or demote the member’s ranking. Affinity identifies the closeness of a member to the user. For example, a friend of a friend who has five common middle friends with the user has a higher affinity than a friend of a friend who has only one common middle friend. What it means: Here we learn that the patent includes the ability to assign affinity values to the relationship between a searcher and a prominent user. This is to say, the more friends they have in common, the higher the affinity score and the more likely their content would be to impact the other’s search results. Section 51 While everything above has been very interesting, it’s in section 51 that we start to see the full impact. They wrote: … when interleaving search results associated with the user’s social graph along with general search results, a promotion can be applied to the search results associated with the user’s social graph in order to increase their visibility. For example, the ranking of search results associated with the user’s friends is often lower than a general wide-spread result. Thus, promotion of search results associated with the user’s social graph can prevent them from being buried by general search results. What it means: Here’s where we read the actual intent, and it’s in the line, “promotion of search results associated with the user’s social graph can prevent them from being buried by general search results.” Where traditionally, certain web pages may not naturally rank highly, they would be promoted to higher positions if prominent members of a searcher’s social graph have engaged with them. Section 52 They wrote: The boosting factor could be based on, for example, the number of friends who endorsed the identified resource or a top affinity to a friend who endorsed the identified resource. Boosting can also be based on authorship (e.g., what is the relationship or affinity with the individual that endorsed the resource), or the type of endorsement did the member of the user’s social graph provide (e.g., an explicit endorsement by starring a result or page or an implicit endorsement by visiting the resource or commenting on a posting). What it means: Where section 51 covered that resources can be boosted based on how one’s social graph interacts with it, in section 52 we get a few more specifics regarding possible methods. For example, they discuss boosting a resource based on the searcher’s relationship with the author or person that endorsed the resource and the type of endorsement (which seems to add more weight to types that require a great engagement and commitment of time). Section 55 They wrote: The search results can be presented to the user, e.g., as a search results page, that includes one or more of the general search results and the search results associated with the user’s social graph. The search results can be presented with separate portions displaying general search results and social graph results … What it means: In section 55, we read how the search engine results page may include a separate section for content boosted from the searcher’s social graph, or those results may be mixed in with the general search results. Section 61 They wrote: … a user can be categorized as a prominent user based on a number of contacts that the user has within one or more computer-implemented services, a number of resources distributed by the user as an author user through one or more computer-implemented services, and/or traffic generated by the user within one or more computer-implemented services. In some examples, traffic can be determined based on a number of resources distributed by the author user and a number of follower users that follow the user within the one or more computer-implemented services (discussed in further detail below). In some examples, a prominent user can include a user having a number of asymmetric contacts within the one or more computer-implemented services that exceeds a threshold number of asymmetric contacts. By way of example, the author user can include a famous user (e.g., a well-known blogger, a celebrity, a professional athlete, a head of state, etc.) that has a significant number of asymmetric contacts … What it means: Here we read how prominent users may be ranked. Prominent users may be selected or prioritized based on a wide array of factors, including the number of people they influence, the amount of traffic they generate, the number of non-reciprocal connections they have and whether they are famous, as well as a host of other possible criteria. Section 66 They wrote: If the user interacts with content distributed by a second prominent user less often, a second affinity score between the user and the second prominent user can be associated with a second value … What it means: As always Google allows for on-the-fly adjustments based on user behavior. In this section, they cover the issue of promoting content from a prominent user in one’s social graph where the boost is not interesting to one in the search environment. Consider a scenario where one of your relatives with whom you communicate regularly via social media or email has their content boosted for your queries.  If you are looking up election information, and their political views are diametrically opposed to your own, this would not be at all useful. You may like them, you may engage with them often, but that doesn’t make them relevant to your everyday search experience. Conclusion So you’ve made it this far, congratulations! Only a few more points to go.  Let’s boil down what this patent includes: A searcher can have a social graph associated with them. This social graph can be created by accessing their social connections including social media sites, blogs, email and chat functions and so on. When Google can make a connection between a users’ persona on one property and another, they will to create a fuller picture of their social graph and connections. Members of a searcher’s social graph can be ranked based on how close they are to the searcher, how many shared connections they have, how popular they are globally, how often the searcher and that user engage with each other and so on. Resources by or recommended by a member of one’s social graph can be boosted into a higher search engine result for a query based on the searcher’s association with the user recommending said resource. If a searcher doesn’t engage with the recommended resources of a specific users consistently, that user’s recommendations may be devalued In short, according to this patent, the things that people you’re connected to recommend, like and engage with could be used to impact your rankings. While I haven’t yet seen any direct evidence of this at this time, it makes sense, and Google has toyed with similar systems in the past. The idea of boosting a restaurant that a friend of mine likes who lives in a city I’m visiting would have easily perceived advantages. Similarly, showing me the news sites my friends are referencing on Facebook when I search for election information also makes sense, knowing that my political views are more likely to be aligned with the majority of my connections. There are a significant number of advantages to a system like this, and because its foundation is based on engagement, it isn’t easily gamed. I’m pretty sure we’re going to see this type of augmentation of the general search results in the near future taking personalization to the next level. And so continues the journey down the long road of personalized results, where now not only will you need a strong site with great content, you need the friends of your prospective clients to engage with it.

Christine Churchill on October 7, 2016 at 10:54 am More The SMX East Session “The 2016 Quantitative Local SEO Ranking Factors Study” presented by Local SEO Guide‘s Dan Leibson (Vice President of Local & Product) and Andrew Shotland (President) explored the results of their recent study analyzing and prioritizing ranking factors that affect local search. Unlike many studies that simply summarize search marketing experts’ opinions, the Local SEO Guide study took actual quantitative data as input. Leibson and Shotland teamed with competitive intelligence tool maker Places Scout and statisticians from the University of California, Irvine. By partnering with the University’s Center for Statistical Consulting, they ensured the study results were independent and withstood objective statistical analysis. Their presentation, entitled “Reverse Engineering Google’s Local Search Algorithm,” highlighted the main findings of their study. It is important to remember that the results of the study reveal correlations, not causations. The study identified characteristics of sites that ranked well; it does not definitively say these characteristics are ranking factors. The study assembled data from over 100 different ranking factors, 30,000 businesses and 3,000 local searches. Factors analyzed in the study included Google My Business listings, on-site website factors, off-site local factors (including citations) and links. Industry standard link tools Majestic and Moz were used for collecting link metrics. (For more details on the methodology used, visit Local Search Ranking Factors Study on the Local SEO Guide website.) Factors Analyzed in Local Search Study The goal of the study was to identify factors that mattered in Google Local 3-Pack and Maps search so that business owners could have actionable data showing what to allocate resources and efforts towards with the goal of improving their local search performance. The results proved that to succeed in local search, the online marketer needs to pay attention to areas not normally considered in local search — namely, links and website optimization. Ordinal and categorical variables The study segmented the ranking factors into Ordinal and Categorical variables. Ordinal Variables were numeric based factors, and sites with higher values for these factors ranked higher. Categorical Variables were Yes/No — if a business had this top-rated characteristic, it tended to rank higher. Ordinal variables included in the study The chart below shows the factors included as Categorical variables (usually a yes/no test) for various ranking factors, again ranked by perceived weight. Categorical factors Many of these factors fall into “foundational SEO” or “foundational Google My Business” factors, which are basic best practices and under the site owner’s control. For example, Google My Business factors like having an Owner Verified (OV) listing or including business hours and photos are easy to do, and these factors will differentiate your site from those who don’t take these basic steps. The takeaway here was that it’s worthwhile to allocate time to build out a robust Google My Business profile. Reviews matter Two Google My Business (GMB) factors topped the list: reviews and profile views (though the latter is more a correlation than a factor — top pages get more views rather than the other way around). Google reviews came in at the top of the list. The sites with the most reviews outranked other businesses. It may be that sites with more reviews get more clicks, but the fact that sites with more reviews ranked at the top is a strong indication that local companies should ensure they have reviews. Another GMB factor was the presence of photos. This factor came in at the eighth position, followed closely by having an owner verified profile and including business hours. Again, taking the time to build out a quality GMB profile is seen as positive. Moving towards traditional organic factors The results of the study confirmed what many in the local search field have suspected: namely, that Google is moving more toward using traditional organic algorithm ranking factors and applying them to local search. Activities that benefit organic SEO also benefit local search. Links, in particular, proved to be a large factor in local search, with various link metrics taking 10 of the top 15 ranking factors. Links have long been considered a major ranking factor in regular organic search. Going forward, local businesses need to pay attention to their linkage data just as in regular search. Other actions that are recommended for organic SEO should also be applied to local SEO. Having a secure site, using keywords in backlink anchor text, and having keywords in the title were shown to be characteristics of sites ranking well in the study. Keywords in the business name showed up as a strong positive factor. It is not suggested that you abuse this, but if you are starting a new business, this might be something to keep in mind. Having a mobile-friendly site came in as the third highest Categorical factor, emphasizing that Google’s shift toward favoring mobile-friendly sites is universal. Google has been saying mobile is a ranking factor in regular organic search, and it appears to help local as well, although sites which are mobile friendly have often had numerous other optimizations done. “Near me” queries In this session, Leibson also presented new results for “near me” type queries. The core takeaway on the “near me” queries is that the anchor text profile of links is important for ranking for those types of queries. Having both a higher raw number and a higher percentage of backlinks with [city] in anchor text, and [city/state] in anchor text correlated with positive pack rankings for “near me” queries, much more so than those same signals showed for non-“near me” local searches. Time & money investment chart To help webmasters know where to prioritize their efforts, Dan and Andrew created their recommended investment chart that shows where to invest your resources for the highest payoff. Link work, followed by website optimization, will provide a big payoff in local search. Chart showing where to invest your time in local search Since traditional SEO best practices were included in the characteristics of ranking sites, local businesses might want to ensure that they allot time to improve their website if they want to stay competitive in local search. The study revealed that local businesses need to go beyond just doing GMB and local citations in a vacuum. They still need to do normal local search work like gathering reviews, developing a robust local profile and citation building, but these are prerequisites. Webmasters need to do all the local work plus traditional SEO. The true value of this study is that it brings quantitative data to an area that has long been dominated by opinions. The results give marketers insights on where to place emphasis and allocate resources in their optimization efforts. Local Search Guide plans to repeat the study next year. It will be interesting to see how factors change as Google moves more toward more artificial intelligence influencing the ranking algorithm.

They’ll pay you to show ads to people who watch your videos or visit your website. You can also pay them to show your ads to people, and it can quickly cost you thousands of dollars. That’s why you need to be really, really careful when you’re playing around in AdSense and AdWords. One pays you to use it, the other expects you to pay when you use it. Which is which? Well, apparently it’s all a bit confusing… especially if you’re a 12-year-old musician who’s trying to keep your feet on the ground while reaching for the stars. With dreams of adoring fans screaming while he and his band mates in Los Salerosos rolled through the gate to his mansion, 12-year-old Jose Javier signed up to make a few bucks off his band’s YouTube videos. He linked up his savings account and waited for the clicks to start rolling in. That they did, but not in the way he’d hoped. Somewhere along the line he confused Google’s products, and he wound up building an ad campaign in AdWords. Instead of seeing commissions piling up in his ledger, Google was sending him invoices. The initial €15 didn’t raise any eyebrows, but when the bank saw an account with a €2,000 balance pinged with charges that had risen to nearly €20,000 they immediately contacted Jose’s parents. By this point, the total on his AdWords account had rocketed to €120,000. His mother told reporters that it was a honest mistake, and that Jose didn’t even see what the big deal was. Maybe that’s because he knew that Google doesn’t enter into binding agreements with 12-year-olds and that they’d ultimately agree to wipe the slate clean. Google did just that, and wouldn’t you know it? Tons of free publicity for Los Salerosos. Well done, Jose! Accident or not, you not only escaped unscathed from a six-figure advertising bill but you also introduced the entire Internet to your band.

 Google's new phone isn’t really a threat to Apple's iPhone — yet Kif Leswing Oct. 7, 2016, 12:21 PM 5,421 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Images/Andrew Burton Google launched a pair of phones earlier this week that were positioned as alternatives to Apple's iPhone, which is the most profitable smartphone in the market thanks to its dominance over the high-end.  Apple shouldn't be too worried that the Pixel, which retails for $649, will immediately cut into its market share, though.  An early supply chain-based estimate from Digitimes, a Taiwanese trade publication, suggests that Google's Pixel could ship between 3-4 million phones in the second half of 2016. By comparison, Apple sold 232 million iPhones during 2015, and is on pace to do about the same amount sales in 2016. Apple ships over 4 million iPhones per week.  Of course, nobody expected Google's Pixel to reach the scale of Apple's iPhone instantly. Apple has spent nearly a decade building its supply chain, retail operation, and brand so that it could sell that many phones. It's just a reminder that Apple has quite the head start on Google in the hardware business.  EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

The benefit of buying a Google Nexus—now Pixel—device has always been that they are usually the first to receive major Android OS updates. Google said as much as its Tuesday event, promising Pixel upgrades as soon as they are available, downloaded in the background. If you buy your Pixel through Verizon, however, it might be business as usual when it comes to Android updates. A Google spokesman confirmed to PCMag that Verizon will handle Android update rollouts for Pixel phones on its network. "Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store," the company said. Last year, in the wake of the Stagefright bug, Google announced that it would roll out monthly security updates for Nexus devices. It appears that will continue with the Pixel, even for Verizon devices, but when it comes to OS updates, rollout schedules will be Verizon's call. Perhaps the carrier will deploy as soon as Google does, but maybe not. If you're eager to have Android updates as soon as they're available, buy directly from Google. While the Pixel is a "Verizon exclusive," meanwhile, there are other options, like Republic Wireless and Google's own Project Fi. Those who purchase a Pixel will get an upgraded version of Nougat that lets users swipe up from the bottom for a quick view of apps (see video above). Pixel comes in two sizes—5 or 5.5 inches—and runs a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. It sports a high-def AMOLED Corning Gorilla Glass 4 display with 4GB of RAM, a fingerprint sensor, USB-C connector, and 3.5mm headphone jack, as well as support for Bluetooth 4.2. Google is offering unlimited storage for full-resolution photos and 4K videos shot with the Pixel's 12.3-megapixel rear-facing camera. And VR fans can pop the Pixel into Google's new Daydream View—the first Daydream-ready headset and controller, available next month for $79. //Related Articles Hands On: Google's Pixel Smartphone Pre-orders are now open in the Australia, Canada, Germany, the US, and the UK.

Android is catching up to iOS -- in ad prices 0 Share: Tech Industry by Alfred Ng October 7, 2016 9:41 AM PDT @alfredwkng Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Enlarge Image Photo by James Martin/CNET Android is finally starting to bring in the big bucks for Google with its ad sales -- but still not as much as iOS does. According to new indexes from Fiksu DSP, a mobile marketing company, ad costs on Android devices have more than doubled since 2015, steadily growing year over year. Marketers have become more willing to pay per user as Android's platform becomes more popular. Android's growth is inching the mobile platform closer to iOS, but Apple is still the lead market for ad buys, as Google's operating system hasn't reached the same level of mass popularity as iOS has -- yet. Apple did not immediately return requests for comment. Google declined to comment. Despite the competition in pricing, a majority of mobile ads tend to run on both Android and iOS. Google hopes that its latest Pixel and Pixel XL phones will help Android take on Apple, as the two companies battle for mobile supremacy. "From last year to now, it's evident that both operating systems are experiencing changes that are largely a function of maturity," Tom Cummings, a vice president of new market development at Fiksu DSP said. Updated at 9:40 a.m. PT: To reflect that a majority of mobile ads run on both platforms.

Follow TechnoBuffalo After weeks of incessant leaks and confusing marketing by Google, the Pixel and Pixel XL were finally announced. The Google phone we’ve all been waiting for is finally here. Right off the bat, the most impressive thing about the Pixel is that it’s a Google phone, through and through. Software and hardware, it was all created by Google’s engineers. The phone itself was built by HTC, but that’s a note most casual consumers won’t ever care about. One of the key additions to the new phones is the Google Assistant, which migrates from Allo to the entire phone. You can now talk to the Assistant anywhere by pressing down on the home button and have a conversation with it. Google talked in detail about how close to human interaction it is, and how it’s aware of context without needing to repeat key words over and over. It looks pretty awesome. Google touted the 12.3MP camera as the best ever. That’s some high praise with the Note 7 and iPhone 7 Plus camera still churning out terrific pics. Apparently, though, the Pixel camera is the highest rated phone camera by DxOMark, earning an 89 score (compared to the iPhone 7’s 86). To add to the appeal of a top of the line camera, Google also includes unlimited Google Photos storage at full resolution with the Pixel phones. You’ll never have to worry about running out of storage due to photos, ever. One area where Android phones fall behind Apple’s products is customer service, and Google answered that head on with 24/7 customer support with screen sharing. If you have any questions or issues with the Pixel, you can call up support and they can see exactly what the issue is. The phone also boasts premium specs: high res displays, 4 gigs of RAM, Snapdragon 821 and USB-C along with some other notable features like quick charging and integration into the Google’s AI vision. There’s no doubt that this phone is a great alternative to Apple or Samsung’s phones. It integrates some of the best aspects of the Google ecosystem while improving on what the Nexus provided, which was already a solid experience. The Pixel is not without many faults, but what phone isn’t at this point—the iPhone 7 design is stale while the Note 7 is blowing up. Check out the video above to see what Jon likes about the Pixel phones.

Called “Made by Google,” the temporary shop will be located at 96 Spring St. and will open its doors to customers starting Oct. 20 just in time for the holidays. Google has not revealed when the shop will close down and whether it will open up similar shops in other cities. Google’s hardware competitors Apple and Microsoft have permanent stores throughout the country. While this marks Google’s first standalone physical venue, the company has played around with showroom-style installations and store-within-a-store shops. In 2014, Google opened up 4 “basecamps” in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, and London to retail the Google Glass. Buy by the end of the year, the Mountain View based company folded the four Google Glass Basecamps stating that more consumers purchased the product online than in store. Related Stories Google Announces New VR Headset At Tech Event In California Google's Chromecast Ultra Streams 4K Content Earlier this week, Google hosted an event—the company called it the largest hardware announcement in its history—where it unveiled a wide array of hardware including the new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphone, the Daydream View VR headset and controller, Google Home, Google Wi-Fi and an updated 4K streaming Chromecast. “One of the most important messages of today is that Google is taking hardware very seriously,” Google Canada’s Head of Public Affairs Aaron Brindle told TechCrunch. “What we’ve seen with the Android ecosystem is that the pace of innovation there is amazing — there are now 1.4 billion daily users on Android. However, this is not about bringing the best of Android to our users — it’s about bringing the best of Google to our users. So that’s taking in all of the investments and research that we’re doing around AI and ML, and packaging it front to back in hardware.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

McCarthy • 10/07/16 11:33am Alibaba Founder and CEO, Jack Ma Wang He/Getty Image As the financial media speculates about Twitter being acquired by Salesforce, Alphabet (formerly Google) or even Apple, companies outside the Californian tech scene have received little attention as potential suitors. There’s now clear interest, appetite and capacity for cross-border mega deals in online tech, as Tencent’s acquisition of Supercell in June this year has shown. “Asian strategic investment in European Tech firms has grown steadily over the last decade but this year it has gone through the roof” says London-based Jack Fisher, Senior Business Development Manager of Global Deals Data provider, PitchBook. Tencent is China’s largest online social media and gaming company. Its landmark majority investment in Finland’s Supercell (makers of the global smash hit mobile game Clash of Clans) valued the 200-person company at US$10.2 billion. This crowned it as Europe’s first “Decacorn” or private startup online tech company to reach a valuation of more than US$10 billion. In June 2016 Finland’s Supercell (and maker of Clash of Clans) became Europe’s 1st Decacorn (Private tech co valued at over $10Bn) thanks to a majority investment from China’s Tencent.

In September last year, China’s other online giant Alibaba hired Michael Evans, the former Vice-Chair of Goldman Sachs, to lead the company’s quest for offshore expansion. Evant has since overseeen five acquisitions, all worth more than US$200 million, and each of them outside China – in Singapore, India, Hong Kong and the US. The latest one is the largest yet — a US$1 billion deal for a controlling stake in the number one South-East Asian e-commerce startup, Singapore based Lazada Group. While Twitter may not be on the radar of overseas investors, there is now a large and growing stream of international global mergers and acquisitions in the technology sector every month. Cross-border deal flow has steadily increased each year since the emergence of the web and shows how the new economics of “online gravity” is accelerating globalization. This new economics has helped forge the five most valuable companies in the world right now — each now valued at more than US$300 billion. They include Apple (with a fortune built on the web connected iPhone), Alphabet (formerly Google), Microsoft (now parent to LinkedIn and Skype), Amazon and Facebook. Two more companies with massive fortunes also built on the incredible economics of the web, the Chinese online giants Tencent and Alibaba, also now enjoy market valuations in excess of US$250 billion each. They now rank among the worlds largest companies. Global tech cross-border dealflow is accelerating. October 2016. Paul X. McCarthy Since 2000, US technology companies have acquired 230 Asian tech companies with the numbers steadily increasing each year. With even more dramatic growth, Asian tech companies have acquired 373 companies since 2000. Between 2011-2013 Asian tech companies were acquiring between 20 to 30 US companies per year and now it’s double this rate with between 50-60 major deals being consummated each year. Recent noteworthy large-scale deals include: Acquirer Acquired Valuation at acquisition Date Softbank, Japan ARM Holdings, UK US $31.4 Billion July 2016 Tencent, China Supercell, Finland US $10.2 Billion June 2016 Tencent, China Riot Games, US US $400 Million February 2011 Rakuten, Japan Ebates, US US $1 Billion September 2014 Rakuten, Japan Viber, Cyprus US $900 Million February 2014 Acquisitions — one of the keys to tech innovation Mergers and acquisitions are a key but often overlooked part of the digital economy and central to the success of the global technology innovation ecosystem as we know it. Most of Alphabet’s significant innovation since it created the world’s most famous search engine has been the result of its 190 acquisitions. Google Maps, for example, was an acquisition, so too Google Docs, Gmail, and YouTube. Many elements at the core of Google’s breathtaking commercial success in online advertising rely on innovation from startups that were acquired and integrated into Google’s own internal efforts. The impact of the web on accelerating globalisation can be seen beyond the tech sector too. Many digitally transformed traditional industries like media, telecommunications and electronics have also become the subject of major Asia-based cross-border acquisitions including: Industry Acquirer Acquired Valuation at acquisition Date Publishing Nikkei, Japan Financial Times, UK US$1.32 billion 2015 Electronics Toshiba, Japan Landis+Gyr, Switzerland US$2.3 Billion 2011 Telecommunications Singtel, Singapore Optus, Australia US$8.5 billion 2001 Not first time there’s been a surge in cross-border deals In the early 1990s Japanese consumer electronics giants were on the hunt for Hollywood movie studios. They wanted media, software or “content” as it has become known to complement their hardware. Japanese companies invested more than US$13 billion (nearly US$25 billion adjusted to today’s money) in the US film and television industry, which included the mega acquisitions of two of the six largest Hollywood film studios — Matsushita’s acquisition of MCA and Sony’s purchase of Columbia Pictures. Even Walt Disney turned to Japan for US$600 million in financing for its films. It remains to be seen whether we may see a repeat of this scale of deal making with any of today’s US online giants given their unprecedented scale. What’s almost certain is we will see more frequent and larger scale cross-border acquisitions of companies up to the size of Twitter (around US$30 billion) and perhaps even at the scale of Paypal or eBay (US$50 billion+). At a smaller scale again, expect to see many more yo-yo deals with companies criss-crossing the planet to acquire others in their efforts to dominate a vertical market or technology sub-sector. Examples of these style deals include: LeEco (Beijing)‘s $10m acquisition of Sydney based LeSports (Sydney) in January Carsales (Melbourne) estimated $15m purchase of Chileautos (Santiago) in March and Naspers (Cape Town) $180m takeover of Citruspay (Mumbai) last month. This Chord diagram using seals data from Crunchbase illustrates the total number of Global cross-border technology deal flows since 2000 organised by continent. It shows the increasing amount of criss-crossing of the planet of capital chasing tech deals to consolidate global positions in market segments and technology verticals. The Conversation Paul X.

(Photo: Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY) SAN FRANCISCO — Something new may be coming soon from Google: A full-blown retail experience to showcase its new consumer electronics devices. For now, the Internet giant is opening a "Made by Google" pop-up shop in New York City. The shop that will spring up at 96 Spring St. on Oct. 20 isn't the first retail location for Google. The Internet giant has had stores inside other stores. But it does not — at least not yet — have the equivalent of Apple stores. The introduction of a high-end line of hardware marks a new era for the Internet giant and there's the hint that a more ambitious brick-and-mortar retail strategy may be in the making. Google is in the midst of a new and very aggressive push to sell its own consumer electronic devices, rather than supplying the software to manufacturers. USA TODAY Google Assistant is star of Google's hardware unveil Pop-up shops are a common prelude to establishing a bigger retail presence. That's what Microsoft did for its Xbox and Surface devices. Samsung has also opened these temporary stores  for the holidays. "It seems inevitable that they need some kind of hardware presence to show this stuff off in a consistent and joined-up way," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research. The challenge? Opening retail outlets is a costly and time-consuming endeavor if Google wants to reach a significant chunk of the U.S. population, Dawson said. "Look at Apple – it launched its first stores 15 years ago, has been ramping up steadily since, and still has under 300 US stores. Microsoft is an even more relevant and a more recent example," he said. "If you’re willing to sacrifice some of the premium in the retail experience, you can roll out more quickly – Microsoft has around 100 US stores. But Microsoft can show off both its own devices and third party devices – I’m not sure Google could reasonably do the same in its retail stores."

Comments By Patrick Thibodeau Follow Computerworld | Oct 6, 2016 12:21 AM PT RELATED TOPICS IT Careers IT Industry Search Comments An age discrimination lawsuit against Google was approved Wednesday as a '"collective action" by a federal court judge in San Jose. The decision means that certain types of software engineers, age 40 or over, who were rejected for jobs at Google since August 2014, and after an in-person interview, will be able to join the lawsuit. Thousands of others may be eligible. But this was more than an ordinary court ruling. Judge Beth Labson Freeman's ruling may be remembered for the artful flourish of its opening sentence and the challenge it seems to be delivering to Silicon Valley. "How does age factor into one's Googleyness?" Freeman wrote at the beginning of a 17-page decision that sets in motion an investigation of Google's hiring practices and corporate culture. The decision concludes by approving a "collective action" -- a type of class action -- that allows a certain class of Google job applicants to join the lawsuit. An effort will made to contact affected people. This lawsuit was brought by two job applicants, both over the age of 40, who alleged age discrimination against Google. One of the plaintiffs, Cheryl Fillekes, a programmer, was interviewed by Google on four separate occasions, including in-person interviews, and was rejected each time. A second plaintiff, Robert Heath, was interviewed by phone, but not in person. The judge limited the class to people who had an in-person interview, which means that job applicants who only had phone interviews can't join the class. The plaintiffs believe tens of thousands may be eligible to join this lawsuit. Google responded to the court's decision in an email: "We believe the allegations here are without merit and we will continue to defend our position vigorously. We have strong policies against discrimination on any unlawful basis, including age," a spokesman wrote. "Anyone who fits the class definition can opt in to the class," said Daniel Low, a Washington-based attorney for the plaintiffs. "For those interviewed in person with Google for a software engineer, site reliability engineer, or systems engineer position when they were 40 years old or older, and received notice on or after August 28, 2014, that they were refused employment, they will have an opportunity to join in the collective action against Google." The plaintiffs are negotiating with Google to get the email addresses of people who fit the class. Google doesn't have the birth dates of job applicants, so it's likely that the college graduation year and employment dates at other companies will be used as a tipoff for age. "We encourage anyone who receives notice to join the class to help vindicate the rights of those subject to age discrimination," Low said. Low said the case may have importance for Silicon Valley as well as Google. "This is an important step forward for the case, and allows us to seek much broader relief than an individual action would have, and it positions the case to have a greater deterrent effect on age discrimination at Google and in the tech industry if it is successful," Low said. In her ruling, Freeman gave weight to Fillekes arguments that she was a victim of age discrimination. Fillekes makes "substantial allegations," wrote the judge, "that the putative class members were together the victims of a single decision, policy, or plan." The lawsuit claimed the median age at Google was 29, based on data collected by Payscale, which the judge cited in the ruling. "Fillekes also recounts her own experience. Among other things, Fillekes describes an instruction from a Google recruiter to "put her dates of graduation on her resume 'so the interviewers [could] see how old [she is] and various concerns about her years of experience," the judge wrote. The judge said that Google's Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) statement was not enough to protect it. "Having such a policy does not necessarily shield a company from a discrimination suit, particularly in light of the evidence and allegations presented here," wrote Freeman, who said that most, if not all companies, "are well versed in anti-discrimination law and make great efforts to ensure that their written policies comply with anti-discrimination law." The decision does not mean that Google will lose the case. The judge said that evidence from an employer "is not germane at the first stage of the certification process, which is focused simply on whether notice should be disseminated to potential claimants." Google, in an earlier court filing, defended itself. It said that Fillekes was recruited by Google four times, in 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2013, and had in-person interviews. Why "waste Google employees' time" with "five or six onsite interviews only to reject the candidate on the basis of age," the company asked, in its filing. "Googleyness" is a term that job applicants at Google may be familiar with. The firm explains it, on its website, this way: "Googleyness: Share how you work individually and on a team, how you help others, how you navigate ambiguity, and how you push yourself to grow outside of your comfort zone."

Google Play Music teams up with Runtastic to offer new workout playlists, free trials Posted Oct 7, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Citymapper founder Azmat Yusuf to join us at TechCrunch Disrupt London, Dec 5-6 In an effort to attract more users to its streaming music service, Google today has teamed up with fitness app Runtastic to offer the app’s users a variety of new workout playlists, including songs for running that are over 130 beats per minute, that are powered by its music service. The songs are available for free within the app, in the 60 countries where Google Play Music is currently available, says Google. What’s interesting is that the deal isn’t just going after Android users. While the songs and playlists curated by Google will be available only in the Runtastic Running & Fitness Android application, both Android and iOS users will be offered free trials to Google Play Music as a part of the deal between the two companies. These new playlists include things like Today’s Running Hits, Sweaty EDM Workout or High-Energy Hard Rock, and will be made available directly in Runtastic’s music section in the app. It’s not unusual for Google to partner with third parties in an effort to push adoption of its Spotify and Apple Music competitor, Google Play Music.

Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « What To Expect When Working With Studio Musicians | Main | Lyor Cohen Takes the Cake by Joining the Google Empire [Op Ed] » Irving Azoff Claims YouTube "Pirates" Are "Really Evil" The CEO and Chairman of Azoff MSG Entertainment, Irving Azoff, is leveling some heavy criticism at YouTube in very public war as he attempts to get the popular video sharing site to properly compensate artists for their music. ______________________________ Guest Post by Dave Brooks on Amplify When you work in the music business, there are three rules you have to understand, according to legendary music manager Irving Azoff. First, “None of us exists except on the talents of others.” Second, “Getting even isn’t good enough.” And third? “Pay now or pay more later.” The Chairman and CEO of Azoff MSG Entertainment is leveraging all three against YouTube, who he is taking on in a very public battle to get the Google-owned video site to compensate artists and grant them more control over how their music appears online. Azoff spoke publicly about the YouTube battle with The Wrap’s editor Sharon Waxman during last week’s The Grill at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills. Just two days before YouTube hired 300 Entertainment founder Lyor Cohen to serve as its Global Head of Music, Azoff took the stage at the film and TV industry event to talk about his ongoing fight with YouTube. “It’s not just that they don’t pay enough. It’s also the control factor,” he told Waxman during the 45-minute Q&A. “Imagine calling up HBO and saying, ‘Game of Thrones premieres tonight. Can you put that up on Youtube, so everybody’s watching it for free also.’ What would that do to the subscription rates of HBO?” He mocked Google for telling its employee “don’t be evil” when it allows music to appear on the site and monetizes copyrighted material with ads. “This is evil. It’s really evil,” he said. “We’re at a time, especially in music, when there’s such a lack of respect for intellectual property, and they’re the worst defender of it,” later adding, “At the time when music has never been more popular, it’s less money for us.” He accused Youtube of “playing whack-a-mole” with its takedown system for copyright material and said artists like Bruno Mars and Don Henley don’t want fans uploading low-quality phone video from concerts to the site. About one-third of Christina Aguilera’s music is streamed on YouTube, but the site makes up less than 10% of her revenue. “About 80% of YouTube users use it for music and 81% of them listen to music they already know,” he said. “What does that tell me? It tells me that YouTube has become a substitute for Apple or Spotify. It’s free, on-demand streaming for consumers. Why would they pay, if they can go get it for free?” Monetizing music or putting it behind a paywall would hurt YouTube traffic, he argued, adding that “Google wants unlicensed music on YouTube because it drives searches through Google and sells advertising on Google.” He also brought up the practice of stream-ripping, where listeners download content from YouTube into MP3 files to later replay on their phones or computers. “This is piracy. They’re pirates,” he said.  “The fact that they can’t have a choice to put it behind a pay wall seems irrational, illogical and not fair.” Waxman pointed out that Youtube pays hundreds of millions to labels for the right to license music. “In the past, they’ve been able to push the artist against the record companies,” Azoff said. “The great thing that’s coming out of this is that for the first time, probably because the economics and business have been so hurt, you’ve got a united music industry. The record companies, publishers, artists, standing together. Streaming is the future. Paid streaming will make everything healthy. Not just economically. It will allow people to make a living rather than starve at it.” How many paid streaming accounts will it take to return the music industry to sustainability? “For the industry to really get healthy, we need 200 million streaming worldwide paid subscribers. You’re not getting there if it stays free,” he said.   Related articles Irving Azoff Threatens To Pull 20K Songs Off YouTube Music Publishing News Roundup 7.13.2015: Downtown + Codigo - Streaming In Spain - "Happy Birthday" Iriving Azoff Calls In Lawyers After YouTube Fails To Take Down 20,000 Songs Sperry | Katie Eary Tags Sharks in Miami Blog Sperry | Hello America Swims with Blue Whales Blog Stevie Wonder & Chaka Khan to headline official Prince tribute Prince Tribute Enlists Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera Posted by Guest Post on 10/07/2016 in Major Labels, More News, Music Biz Podcast, Video | Permalink Comments Irving Azoff Claims YouTube "Pirates" Are "Really Evil" The CEO and Chairman of Azoff MSG Entertainment, Irving Azoff, is leveling some heavy criticism at YouTube in very public war as he attempts to get the popular video sharing site to properly compensate artists for their music.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google unveiled its new Pixel smartphones at an event in San Francisco on Tuesday. Considering the frequency of leaks leading up to the event, including official renders the night before, the announcement became more of a formality than a celebration of groundbreaking technology. With the release, Android enthusiasts are getting access to the search giant’s ideal vision of what a smartphone should be, from the design, to the hardware, to the brainy new software, highlighted by Google Assistant. And while there’s a lot to like about the new devices—free full-resolution photos and videos backup!—there are plenty of reasons to skip Google’s answer to Apple’s iPhone. Among them, the Pixel’s design is pretty bland. Over the past few years, the mobile market’s top manufacturers, from HTC to Samsung, have churned out incredible designs, including the HTC 10 and Galaxy Note 7. The Pixel, on the other hand, is more like plain toast, the color beige. While not horrible, the Pixel design won’t win any awards. Design is subjective, of course, so something we find boring you might find exciting. There’s no getting around the Pixel’s other shortcomings, however. No wireless charging, no expandable storage, a high price of entry, and an IP53 rating, which is pretty low on the scale of dust and water resistance. Are all of these features necessary to make the Pixel successful? No, not at all. Is there such thing as the perfect smartphone? Keep dreaming. Still, it’s important you understand what the Pixel offers before you buy one. At $649 unlocked, it’s not the cheapest smartphone on the market. Then again, neither are the iPhone 7 or Galaxy Note 7. Check out the video above to hear more thoughts from Jon about why you should skip the Google Pixel.

David Dayen David Dayen 2016-10-07T14:17:24+00:00 Photo: Kimihiro Hoshino/AFP/Getty Images In May, when Google announced it would ban all payday loan advertisements through its AdWords service, consumer advocates were thrilled. “Banning predatory payday loan ads shows that Google is willing to put people before profits,” gushed Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. But months after the policy was implemented, brokers that connect borrowers to payday lenders still buy Google ads. They appear to have easily sidestepped the company’s rules, leaving consumers still vulnerable to high-cost debt traps that can ruin their financial lives. Under Google’s rules, which went into effect in July, advertisers for what they call “personal loans” can be banned if they require repayment in full in 60 days or less, or carry an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) above 36 percent. This eliminates all payday loans, which are typically due within two weeks, and have APRs well over 300 percent. The terms for the loans must be stated in a disclaimer at the site. The policy applies to direct lenders as well as those who connect borrowers with third parties. “We want to protect our users from deceptive or harmful financial products,” Google’s rules say. But today, a simple Google query for “payday loans” yields a number of paid links at the top of the search, from companies like GOInstallmentLoans.com, WeLend2U and QuickLoanTree. A screenshot of Google’s payday loan ads. Image: Google These are not payday lenders but what are known as “lead generators.” They take consumers’ personal information, run a credit history, and then sell the file to payday lenders, based on what kind of loan they can afford. Lead generators can get up to $200 for a good lead. “Hiding behind lead generators allows payday companies to skirt state law,” said Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder of PawnGuru.com, a website that connects consumers and pawn shops. Birnholtz first discovered the lead generator ads because he tracks keywords to see how users enter his site. Lead generators are covered under Google’s policy. But the various companies’ disclaimers are almost comically vague. “Rates start as low as 6.59%-35.8%,” reads the “Fees and Interest” page at GoInstallmentLoans.com. But “For those that do not meet the minimum requirements for a personal loan, alternative loan solutions may be offered to you,” where the above rates don’t apply. That negates the entire purpose of posting the rates. A loan advertisement from GoInstallmentloans.com. Image: goinstallmentloans.com QuickLoanTree advises it “cannot guarantee any APR.” It nevertheless says, “The maximum Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is 35.99%,” but quickly adds that “the lender can provide a different APR than our range.” Loans of Success, a separate lead generator, features the same language. An explanation of Quick Loan Tree’s APR policy. Image: Quick Loan Tree WeLend2U counsels that consumers “can be offered loans with APRs below 36% and have payment terms ranging from 61 days to 60 months, or more.” But it does not guarantee those rates, and later in its terms and conditions it adds, “The lender determines all fees and rates based on the information provided in the registration form,” rendering any rates they post irrelevant. Welend2u Loans’ APR policy. Image: WeLend2U.com CashAnytime, another lead generator, similarly says that consumers can get a 36% APR loan due in more than 60 days, but “not all lenders can provide the maximum amount or terms advertised.” Cash Anytime’s policy. Image: Cash Anytime Only BadCreditLoans comes close to meeting Google’s standards, saying borrowers “can” get loans with terms within the Google policy guidelines. They are the only site to prominently display a representative example of the total cost of the loan, as required. An advertisement from Bad Credit Loans. Image: Badcreditloans.com “While things have improved it looks like some [lead generators] are, predictably, trying to get around the rules,” said Gynnie Robnett, Campaign Director for Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of consumer groups. This is extremely common for the payday lending industry, whose business model is in some part predicated on skirting regulatory barriers to get high-cost loans into customers’ hands. Payday lenders have asserted exemptions from state laws because they operate on sovereign tribal land; they’ve sold online loans inside payday storefronts to get around state interest rate caps. It’s only natural that they would use similar tactics to skate past the internal rules of a private-sector company. In a statement, a spokesperson for Google said: “We continue to implement our policy and will take action on ads and advertisers that are not in compliance. These actions include removing ads and permanently banning advertisers from using AdWords.” The company also claims that over 3 million proposed ad placements have been disapproved since they’ve implemented the policy change, and thousands of advertiser accounts have been either suspended or sanctioned. According to the Google blog, in 2015 they disapproved 780 million proposed ad placements ads for a range of abuses, including phishing scams and counterfeiting. “We’re always updating our technology and our policies based on your feedback—and working to stay one step ahead of the fraudsters,” Google writes. But despite these attempts, the lead generator ads that are advertising on Google are almost defiant in their obvious bid to peddle high-cost payday loans to consumers. Their disclaimers are self-negating and do not commit them to serving any type of loan to a borrower. “If Google wants to maintain this policy, they should maintain it,” said Jordan Birnholtz of PawnGuru. “It’s not a difficult task to look a couple pages into the website.” According to PawnGuru data, millennials who use alternative financial products are three times more likely than other age groups to start their search online; Birnholtz says the ads target younger people with low financial literacy. And with Google the dominant search engine for Web users, compliance with their policies dictates to a large extent what ads Americans see. Under Google’s policy, individuals or consumer associations can report ads that violate their standards. But as of Oct. 5, lead generator ads with dubious disclaimers were still running. The advocacy groups that supported Google’s policy change continue to stand by them. “We expect some in the payday industry to try and game the system,” said Scott Simpson of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “Google is doing the right thing; predatory lenders are just continuing to be predatory.” Top photo: The Google logo is seen on display at the company’s headquarters Oct. 18, 2007, in Mountain View, California.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar) Share Written by Alison Griswold Obsession Machines with Brains October 07, 2016 One of the worst crashes yet involving a Google self-driving car happened on Sept. 23, when another vehicle ran a red light and barreled into the passenger side of one the company’s Lexus SUVs. When the incident was first reported last month, Google emphasized that the light “was green for at least six seconds before our car entered the intersection.” But on Oct. 6 in its monthly self-driving car project report the company released a more startling detail: the crash was severe enough that its test driver “voluntarily went to a local hospital.” Here’s what happened, according to Google’s latest report: As the Google [autonomous vehicle] proceeded through a green light at the El Camino Real intersection, its autonomous technology detected another vehicle traveling westbound on El Camino Real approaching the intersection at 30 mph and began to apply the Google AV’s brakes in anticipation that the other vehicle would run through the red light. The Google AV test driver then disengaged the autonomous technology and took manual control of the Google AV. Immediately thereafter, the other vehicle ran through the red light and collided with the right side of the Google AV at 30 mph. At the time of collision, the Google AV was traveling at 22 mph. The Google AV sustained substantial damage to its front and rear passenger doors. The other vehicle sustained significant damage to its front end. The driver turned out to be fine, “evaluated by medical staff and released,” according to Google’s report. Even so, the anecdote is a bit unsettling when tech companies and automakers alike are rushing to get autonomous technology ready for the road, and Uber has begun putting real passengers into its driverless vehicles in Pittsburgh. Earlier this week, Quartz reported on two minor scrapes that Uber’s self-driving cars have already gotten into in the Steel City. Higher profile incidents involving driverless technologies this year include a self-driving Google car hitting a public bus in Silicon Valley, and a crash that killed the driver of a Tesla Model S while autopilot was enabled. For now, tests of truly driverless cars like Google’s and Uber’s always involve an engineer or other form of safety driver behind the wheel. This can add an even greater degree of uncertainty, as human operators are inevitably forced to make split-second decisions about whether they should intervene, or trust the vehicle to negotiate a tricky spot. Google’s report does not comment on whether the test driver responded appropriately by turning off the car’s autonomy, but the phrasing of its report implies that the driver may have interfered with the car’s ability to avoid a collision (“its autonomous technology detected another vehicle … and began to apply the Google AV’s brakes in anticipation that the other vehicle would run through the red light”). At the bottom of September’s self-driving car report, Google notes that future reports will not mention “collisions that occurred while our car was being manually driven.” The company did not elaborate on why. It will “continue to include manual collisions that occur when the test driver takes control at the last moment,” as seems to have been the case in the Sept. 23 accident. Google’s self-driving car project began in 2009 and on Oct. 5 the company announced that its vehicles had driven more than 2 million miles on public roads. Google, now a division of Alphabet, said it had reached the 1 million mile threshold just 16 months earlier. Its self-driving fleet in the US consists of 24 Lexus SUVs and 34 prototype vehicles, operating on the roadways of four different states.

Confirmed attendees include reps for Uber, the Internet Association, CTA, ITI and MPAA, sources told us. The Trump side will be represented by Rich Bagger, executive director of the transition effort; Bill Palatucci, its general counsel; Ado Machida, head of policy implementation; and Cam Henderson, the outfit’s finance director. A big name who won’t be there? New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who’s leading the Trump transition. He was initially slated to attend, but Christie will instead be traveling with the GOP candidate, according to an updated invite Tony snagged Thursday night. Story Continued Below — Many tech companies have opposed Trump’s candidacy because of his divisive rhetoric, and industry groups have also called for his campaign to establish a tech policy platform, something the Clinton team released this summer. “We hope the campaign will issue a tech agenda and consider the value of trade, highly skilled immigration, the harm from patent trolls and our burgeoning debt, as our American future depends on an innovation economy,” CTA President Gary Shapiro told MT, in a statement. Several of the groups lined up to attend today’s meeting have also met with the Clinton campaign one-on-one to talk tech policy, sources close to the matter say. PALLONE, PRIVACY GROUPS CHEER FCC RULES — An array of consumer interest groups heralded the protections of the FCC’s proposed broadband privacy rules, which would require ISPs to obtain a consumer’s affirmative consent before using or sharing their “sensitive” data, like web browsing information, reports Alex. Public Knowledge, the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Center for Digital Democracy were among those that praised the rules. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) noted how the new privacy policies would help to ensure that all consumers, regardless of income, are treated equally by telecom companies, some of which have previously employed pay-for-privacy programs. “No one — no matter their income — should be forced to choose between privacy and staying connected,” he said, in a statement. FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez also wrote in a statement supporting the policies, “I believe that our input has helped strengthen this important initiative.” — A ‘faux compromise’? Telecom companies, on the other hand, said the proposed rules are not consistent with the FTC’s approach to privacy and user data, reports Margaret. Though FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler narrowed the original proposal — which would have applied an opt-in requirement for use of any consumer data — groups like NCTA — The Internet & Television Association argue that the agency’s definition of “sensitive data” is broader in scope than the FTC’s classification. USTelecom also noted that web companies and ISPs should be subject to consistent privacy policies, rather than different standards, while ITIF said the rules resembled the FTC’s “in name only.” A statement from the organization added: “Like many of FCC Chairman Wheeler’s last-minute policy initiatives, the FCC appears to be using poor process to push through a faux compromise.” GOOD FRIDAY MORNING!

EPIC ALLEGES GOOGLE TRIED TO SECRETLY INFLUENCE FCC PRIVACY PLAN — The Electronic Privacy Information Center is flagging an April email exchange between Google Vice President Vint Cerf and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler regarding the agency’s broadband privacy proposal as an inappropriate effort to lobby on the plan. The email discussion, revealed as part of an EPIC Freedom of Information Act request, revolves around whether the rules would cover IP addresses — an exchange for which Cerf did not submit an ex parte filing. “Everyone else has been very careful about their ex parte filings and here is a backdoor communication with the chairman by the top spokesperson for a key industry seeking to avoid coverage under the rule, which is of course precisely the reason for a public rulemaking,” EPIC’s Claire Gartland told MT. — An FCC official, however, said the agency deemed an ex parte filing was not necessary in this case, because the email was of a clarifying nature. Google declined to comment, but a source close to Cerf said he was acting in a private capacity and using a personal email address. TECH GROUPS WANT PUBLIC COMMENT ON SET-TOP BOX — A host of tech advocacy groups, including TechFreedom, CALInnovates and ITIF, are calling for the FCC to lift the Sunshine restrictions on its set-top box rules to allow for public comment on the full proposal, echoing the message of civil rights organizations from earlier this week. They argue, in a letter this morning, that the agency should issue a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would enable all concerned parties to share their feedback. The groups also highlight a statement that President Barack Obama once made when he was a senator. “Congress and the public have the right to review any specific proposal and decide whether or not it constitutes sound policy,” Obama wrote in 2007 to then-FCC Chair Kevin Martin. “And the Commission has the responsibility to defend any new proposal in public discourse and debate.” FCC’S HURRICANE MATTHEW GUIDANCE — The FCC made ready Thursday for Hurricane Matthew’s expected landfall in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas by issuing guidance to ensure that emergency communications run smoothly over the weekend. The agency has said it will be on-call 24/7 in the coming days, coordinating with several of its bureaus to maintain steady operations of wireless and wireline services. Airbnb has also initiated its disaster response feature in Florida and South Carolina, which allows users on the platform to list their homes for free, so those in affected areas can seek refuge. TECHIE JOINS MCMULLIN’S TICKET — Conservative independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin has selected as his running mate Mindy Finn, a businesswoman who helped establish Twitter’s strategic partnerships program in D.C. and also founded Misschief Media, a public affairs company that’s worked with clients including Change.org and Medium. DATA FOR DRONES — Verizon on Thursday announced its data for drones program, which will enable the aerial devices to connect with its wireless services and go online while in flight. The drone data plans begin at $25 a month for 1 GB of data and will allow drones to stream video and take photos that it can transmit back to users. One application of such data plans that the company outlines is the potential to allow drones to fly more remotely, beyond the FAA’s requirement that they be deployed within an operator’s line of sight. FACEBOOK’S FREE BASICS COMING TO THE U.S.? — The social network is reportedly in talks with the White House to bring its internet app, which faltered in India, to regions that have limited internet access here in the U.S., reports The Washington Post. Facebook’s Free Basics app works with mobile service providers to allow users to access various online sites related to health information and news without using data. Sources tell the Post that Facebook is proceeding gingerly toward a potential U.S. rollout — which would be aimed at low-income and rural consumers — because it doesn’t want to encounter the same regulatory snags that emerged in India. One of the key concerns about Free Basics is that it violates the premise of net neutrality: limiting the kind of information that users can access, based on the wireless program they’re locked into. DOES SLAMMING PATENT TROLLS WEAKEN PATENT PROTECTIONS? — The FTC’s study on patent trolls, more formally known as patent assertion entities, concluded on Thursday that litigation costs should be reduced for defendants in patent infringement suits and notifications about such suits should be more clear. Its findings were met with praise from tech companies, which have long been plagued by such filings. “We applaud the commission’s efforts to rethink the system so that companies like ours can continue to innovate on behalf of our customers without burdensome, frivolous and costly court battles,” said Amazon, in a statement. The Innovation Alliance, however, said that the decision could potentially weaken patent protections and argued that its limited sample size shouldn’t have such generalized applications. SOCIALIZING IN VIRTUAL REALITY — Once primarily dominated by gamers, virtual reality is expanding its world to include more social applications, like video-chatting with friends. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated just that on an Oculus Rift headset while onstage at the Oculus Connect presentation on Thursday, video-chatting with his wife, Priscilla Chan, using the device. Other updates to the technology, including the ability to develop a customized avatar that can showcase a range of emotions, also serve to open up the headsets to broader uses. Conspicuously missing at the event: Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, who recently landed in hot water when it was revealed that he’s been funding a group that helps produce alt-right content and memes.

[Photo: Flickr user Sigmadp2j] Tina Amirtha 10.07.16 10:00 AM In May, Google research scientist Douglas Eck left his Silicon Valley office to spend a few days at Moogfest, a gathering for music, art, and technology enthusiasts deep in North Carolina's Smoky Mountains. Eck told the festival's music-savvy attendees about his team’s new ideas about how to teach computers to help musicians write music—generate harmonies, create transitions in a song, and elaborate on a recurring theme. Someday, the machine could learn to write a song all on its own. Eck hadn't come to the festival—which was inspired by the legendary creator of the Moog synthesizer and peopled with musicians and electronic music nerds—simply to introduce his team's challenging project. To "learn" how to create art and music, he and his colleagues need users to feed the machines tons of data, using MIDI, a format more often associated with dinky video game sounds than with complex machine learning. An example of a composition in MIDI. Researchers have been experimenting with AI-generated music for years. Scientists at Sony's Computer Science Laboratory in France recently released what some have called the first AI-generated pop songs, composed from their in-house AI algorithms (although they were arranged by a human musician, who also wrote their lyrics). Their AI platform, FlowMachines, has also composed jazz and classical scores in the past using MIDI. Eck's talk at Moogfest was a prelude to a Google research program called Magenta, which aims to write code that can learn how to generate art, starting with music. A song cowritten by Sony's FlowMachines algorithm. Listening to and making music is worth pursuing because, researchers say, both activities can help intelligent systems achieve the holy grail of intelligence: cognition. Just as computers are starting to evolve from simply reading text to understanding speech, computers might start to regularly interpret and generate their own music. "You can learn an awful lot about language by studying text. MIDI gives us the musical equivalent. The more we understand about music creation and music perception, the more we’ll understand general, important aspects of communication and cognition," says Eck, now a research scientist on Google’s Magenta project. From Crashing Computers To Making Them More Creative As synthesizers gained popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, engineers started to experiment with ways to get their electronic instruments to communicate with each other. The result was the Musical Instrument Digital Interface, or MIDI, which the music industry adopted as a technical standard in 1983 after its creators, Dave Smith and Ikutaro Kakehashi, made it royalty-free, offering up the idea for the world to use. "In hindsight, I think it was the right thing to do," Smith told Fortune in 2013. "We wanted to be sure we had 100% participation, so we decided not to charge any other companies that wanted to use it." Personal computers soon evolved to read and store MIDI files, which reduce high-level, abstract pieces of music into machine-readable data in a very compact format (a song stored in a 4 MB MP3 file would be a mere few hundred kilobytes in MIDI). MIDI would become standard on electronic instruments, from keyboards and drum machines to MIDI guitar controllers and electronic drum kits. Music composed through MIDI has powered the rise of dance, techno, house, and drum and bass music, and its sound can be heard in most television and film scores. MIDI is the symbolic representation of music, just like text is the symbolic representation of speech. "MIDI itself doesn’t contain sound—it’s just instructions," says Jonathan Lee, a musician who specializes in MIDI. One MIDI link can carry up to 16 channels of data, indicating information about things like musical notation, pitch and velocity, volume, vibrato, audio panning, cues, and tempo. Instruments can also retrieve sounds from a set of prerecorded sounds, called SoundFonts, which are stored in a separate file. The format provides a wide latitude for musicians, allowing novices to compose sophisticated arrangements and more experienced talents to build complex orchestrations. A MIDI composition. Though digital instruments still use the 30-year-old, five-pin MIDI connection, every modern computer and even the Chrome browser has the ability to receive instructions from MIDI devices via a USB adapter. The format has come a long way since 1990s Geocities pages and games like Doom, thanks to better computing power, digital samplers, and recent movements like "Black MIDI," in which MIDI musicians like Lee saturate a digital musical score with so many notes, typically in the thousands or millions, that little white peers through. The most popular song that Lee has ever released—1.6 million views on his YouTube channel, TheSuperMarioBros2—contains 7.6 million musical notes. Playing it on YouTube sounds like Philip Glass on acid; playing it through MIDI software like Piano From Above or Synthesia would likely crash your computer. "Ninety percent of computers wouldn’t be able to play it without giving up," says Lee. An example of Black MIDI Lee, a 17-year-old Houston native, said he burned through the RAM and CPUs of both of his parents’ laptops by experimenting with these Black MIDIs. He eventually bought himself a gaming-grade computer that could withstand his experimentation. Lee believes that Black MIDIs, with their densely complex set of computer instructions, could push engineers to create software that relies less on RAM and more on CPU power, for example. This could help prevent computers from crashing during periods of heavy processing. Deep Learning With Music As learning material, MIDI files are a computer scientist’s dream, unlike audio recordings; They are small, available in troves on the internet, and royalty-free, providing a resource that can be used to virtually train AI machines without limit. The state of the art in training computers is deep learning, artificial learning that uses neural networks, a method of storing information that loosely approximates the information processing of the brain and nervous system. In computer vision, where deep learning has become the standard machine learning technique, scientists know how a computer learns through a neural network when the computer knows what shapes to look for in an image. You can see this process in reverse in the Deep Dream algorithm. Google engineers Alexander Mordvintsev, Christopher Olah, and Mike Tyka used the company's image-recognition software to "hallucinate" images out of everyday scenes, based on the system's memory of other images it had found online. The Deep Dream algorithm reverses the image recognition process, "seeing" images in the patterns of other images. Music algorithms, fed with MIDI music and other inputs, can write songs through an analogous process. What perplexes scientists more is how and if computers can perceive something that is more subjective, like music genres, chords, and moods. Listening to music can help computers reach this higher-level cognitive step. In July, a team of scientists from Queen Mary University of London reported they had trained a neural network to determine musical genres with 75% accuracy by feeding it with 6,600 songs in three genres: ballad, dance, and hip-hop. Then they tore apart the layers of the computer’s neural network in order to see what the network learned at each layer when the scientists exposed it to songs from Bach and Eminem. The researchers saw that the computer started to detect basic patterns, like percussive instruments, at the neural network’s lower levels, and more abstract concepts, like harmonic patterns, at the highest level. Rather than using MIDI representations or other kinds of music notation, the researchers fed their learning algorithms 80,000 samples of raw audio signals extracted from the 8,000 songs. That decision may reflect the limitations of MIDI and other digital representations for teaching machines to learn the nuances of analog music. In MIDI, the human voice is "that human intangible that ends up being a little bit absent, in the same way that you might have a Boston accent versus one from Texas or Minnesota." "Something like MIDI has a lot of potential in terms of modeling classical elements of music such as harmony, or rhythm, or structure and form," says Eric Humphrey, a former doctoral researcher at the Music and Audio Research Laboratory at New York University, who is now a senior machine learning researcher at Spotify. "But what is really interesting is that MIDI isn’t necessarily good at modeling timbre or production effects." Among other things, that means that "a lot of popular, modern music is not well-coded by MIDI." "In terms of the expressivity and the nuance of the performance, that’s that human intangible that ends up being a little bit absent, in the same way that you might have a Boston accent versus one from Texas or Minnesota," says Humphrey. To detect the multiple patterns present in a song, the Google researchers took a cue from the field of image recognition. Rather than meditating on what might get lost in the art form, Google has already started to build new deep learning models to generate music. Over the summer, Project Magenta researcher Anna Huang designed a neural network to write in new voice sections in Bach chorales, whose original voice sections she had sporadically deleted. Huang and the team initially considered using the techniques of computer speech generation to finish the middle of a song if a musician had already written the beginning and the end. But the researchers saw two problems with reusing the machine learning models used for speech generation. First, music is multifarious; several instruments and voices play out at once. In speech recognition, the computer essentially must only learn the pattern of one person talking. Second, musicians might not write scores in a linear fashion but, instead, opt to go back and fill in gaps as they compose. Spoken languages, on the other hand, build ideas in a logical sequence. To address the first problem, the researchers took a cue from the field of image recognition. They found a machine learning model that taught computers to reconstruct the blanks in an image, a method called "inpainting." They thought that if computers could simultaneously recognize three RGB values in a picture, then they could think of each voice as a separate RGB value in their new model. To address the second problem, they decided to write an algorithm that let the computer generate melodies randomly, rather than sequentially. The team trained its computers with several MIDI Bach chorales containing soprano, alto, mezzo-soprano, and baritone voice parts that they randomly cut out at different points in the pieces. At any given time during the modified sections, the computer would "hear" one to three voices. Then, the researchers tested what the computer learned by gradually taking out each voice part in a single Bach chorale until none were left. The team left the computer’s 28-layer neural network to generate new voices from each previous voice it had generated. Music generated by Google's Magenta. In the end, Google researchers were pleased with the overall aesthetic of the computer’s new work. Analyzing these Bach chorales taught Google that it could teach a computer to resolve musical dissonance, lean toward a preferred set of harmonies, and learn the musical key. But their model only digitally approximated a few real-world musical style points. For one thing, their model did not account for the natural limits in pitch range that specialized vocalists, like a soprano or alto, would have. At certain points, the computer inflected the pitch in a voice line to stay in line with the musical key. The team is working on new ways to better code these human aspects into its machine learning model. Music generated by Google's Magenta. To do that, it will need more music to "teach" from. Besides producing new research useful for artificial intelligence more broadly, the Magenta engineers are also enthusiastic about growing their collaboration with the music community. In August, the team issued an updated interface between musicians and TensorFlow, Google’s open-source AI software. The new release allows musicians to connect Google’s AI model to their own synthesizers and MIDI controllers to make AI-generated music in real time. Meanwhile software developers can also connect their own AI models in lieu of the one from Google, in the hopes that injecting non-Google ideas into the Magenta community will trigger more experimentation. Lee, meanwhile, continues to make his own brand of Black MIDIs and publish them on YouTube. His MIDI compositions weave novel "note art," like swirls, letters, and even Morse code, into the visual effects of the musical score. Some are more mathematical in nature—one video, "Pi," contains exactly 3.141592 million musical notes and is 3:14 long, and another one, "Fractal Images," describes a set of mathematical equations called the Mandelbrot set. Lee's MIDI-composed "Pi" When told that Google was looking for people to contribute MIDI files to its new AI project, Lee was eager to contribute. He plans to canvas the entire Black MIDI community to upload their files to the project. If those super-dense MIDI files don't crash computers, perhaps they could teach them a few things about how to write their own Black MIDI songs. "We’re going to flood them with good content," he says. This story was originally published with the headline, "The Music That Inspires Computers To Write Their Own Songs" Never miss a story.

The combination of modern, capable hardware and a relatively affordable price will improve chances of Xiaomi’s STB to become popular among those who use Google's Android TV platform. The Xiaomi Mi is powered by Amlogic’s S905X-H SoC (four ARM Cortex-A53 cores at 2.0 GHz, five ARM Mali-450MP clusters) and is equipped with 2 GB of DDR3 memory, 8 GB of NAND flash, a wireless module supporting Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0, a USB port as well as an HDMI 2.0a output with HDCP 2.2 and CEC. Xiaomi bundles a Bluetooth remote with a mic and voice search feature with its STB for extra convenience. In addition, the company sells its Mi Game Controller for those, who would like to play Android games on TV. Since the STB runs Android TV 6.0, it supports various popular streaming services (including those from Google, Hulu, Netflix, Pandora, VUDU and so on) and TV channels via apps (such as CNN, Disney and ESPN) out-of-the-box. Furthermore the box is also capable of acting as a Google Cast receiver, which allows it to work with applications that support casting but not stand-alone Android TV. This is especially notable since Google also announced their similarly priced Chomrcast Ultra this week, whose primary feature is 4K support as well. This gives the Mi Box a leg up on paper, since it should be able to do most of what the Chromecast can do while adding its Android TV capabilities on top of that. The hardware and software of Xiaomi’s Mi Box supports the latest codecs and standards, including VP9 Profile 2, H.265, and  HDR10 (but not Dolby Vision). So owners of appropriate subscriptions and TVs can access more or less every audio/video format under the sun, including 4Kp60 video with HDR metadata or 1080p60 video with DTS 2.0 or Dolby Digital Plus audio (the STB also has an S/PDIF optical out and a 3.5-mm out for audio). The Xiaomi Mi Box Specifications   Mi Box OS Google Android 6.0 (Google Cast compatible) SoC Amlogic’s S905X-H SoC Four ARM Cortex-A53 cores at 2.0 GHz 3+2 ARM Mali-450MP clusters RAM 2 GB DDR3 Storage 8 GB of NAND USB 2.0 Wi-Fi Dual-Band 802.11ac Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.0 Video Output Connector HDMI 2.0a Video Output Resolution 1080p 4Kp60 Video Up-Conversion Unknown HDR HDR10 Audio Output HDMI Optical 3.5 mm jack Audio Features DTS 2.0+ Digital Out, Dolby Digital Plus Up to 7.1 pass through Remote Bluetooth remote with voice search Video Decoding Capabilities VP9 Profile-2 up to 4K x 2K at 60fps H.265 HEVC MP-10 at L5.1, up to 4K x 2K at 60fps H.264 AVC HPat L5.1, up to 4K x 2K at 30fps H.264 MVC, up to 1080P at 60fps Supports HDR10/HLG HDR processing (software upgrade required) Power Consumption up to 11 W Price $69 At present, there are not a lot of 4Kp60-capable Android TV media players. In fact, until now only NVIDIA’s SHIELD Android TV console supported 4K at 60 fps along with HDR, so the launch of the Xiaomi Mi Box gives owners of UHDTVs a second Android TV option. The Mi Box is nowhere near as powerful for non-video tasks, but at $69, it's considerably more affordable than the $199 console from NVIDIA. The Xiaomi Mi Box is available right now from Mi.com and will also be sold by Walmart in the coming days or weeks. Sources: Xiaomi, CNX Software.

Reply djsvetljo - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link +1 Reply close - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link The only reasons I can think about for the need for Ethernet is that either you're constantly moving a huge amount of data between the two points and you need to do it fast or you have no WiFi available. Even 802.1n or less is enough for 4K streaming. I can assume you don't plan on moving 10TB of data through the media box. And if you do maybe it's time to rethink your network setup. Reply webdoctors - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link Wifi never seems reliable for me, regardless of routers or placement in my house. Especially when doing game streaming. Ethernet has already solved this issue and ethernet ports are cheap. Not having one is definitely a deal breaker. Reply close - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link Seeing how everybody complains about "unreliable WiFi" more than 3-4m (!!!) away I guess I can only praise the wireless gods for my 8 year old 802.1n router that somehow still manages to stream at a steady ~40Mbps. The newer router ($100 TP-Link) manages a steady 70-80Mbps on 2.4GHz (enough even for 4K BR assuming I'd ever want to do it) and ~130-150Mbps on 5GHz albeit at just 4-5m. I have to say I find it really strange that no reputable reviewer or sites like smallnetbuilder ever came to the same conclusion that's transpiring in this discussion: that WiFi simply can't stream reliably... But to each his own. Just as a suggestion, picking a good router and configuring it properly will go a long way and maybe save you the effort of laying "flat cables under baseboards" throughout the house. There's a limit to how many cables and switches you can or want to lay around and more and more devices are mobile or all-wireless simply because WiFi is good enough... for people who don't have a huge collection of 4K Blu-Rays that they need to send to a TV on another floor...

Crunch Network The case for Twitter’s independence (unless Google or management buys) Posted Oct 7, 2016 by Keith Teare (@kteare) 0 SHARES Next Story Reminder: We’re meeting tonight in São Paulo, Brazil Keith Teare Crunch Network Contributor Keith Teare is the co-founder of TechCrunch and today runs Palo Alto incubator Archimedes Labs. How to join the network The problems associated with the widespread rumors of Twitters “for sale” status and that the management team is divided on whether or not to sell the company were compounded this morning with reports that Google, Disney and Apple will not be bidders. The stock price is down 20 percent to $19.79 at the time of writing. Who runs Twitter — board or management? The impressive board of directors seems to have set itself against CEO Jack Dorsey by seeking an exit. This is not the first time the company seems to be being run by the board rather than management. Previous changes in strategy, management and even the decision to IPO do not seem to have been organic decisions planned by management, but rather reactive board-led decisions. As anybody who has run a business knows, a board-management tug-of-war almost never results in a win. Boards hold managers accountable on behalf of shareholders, and managers run companies. It is not clear that this is the case at Twitter — and that may be the source of many of the issues. The board is made up of many celebrity figures, including Peter Fenton, Marjorie Scardino, Bret Taylor, David Rosenblatt, Martha Lane Fox and Omid Kordestani. Previously, Fred Wilson had also been a strong-minded board member. The board’s opinions about the strategy and tactics may reflect a weak management needing direction, or may represent frustrated operators hoping for an exit and seeking to influence day-to-day decisions. Only an insider knows. But one thing is clear, unless Twitter management actually runs the company, the future of the company will be bleak. In this context, the big question that should be being asked is remarkably absent from the discussion. Should Twitter be sold? Another way to ask this question is — is Twitter like Yahoo? Is the company a product of a previous era, with limited growth potential, ready to be moved to a company with deep pockets that would value the 300 million or so monthly active users? Yes and No. The case for “No” Why no? In principle, Twitter is the communications bus for the entire world. I would guess that 2-3 billion people a month see a Tweet mentioned on TV, radio, in a movie, in print. It has become an almost ubiquitous broadcast platform for anybody wishing to publish an event, an opinion, a riposte. It is a marketing platform used by every brand in the world. Compared to the other means of disseminating content, Twitter is a giant. In its earliest manifestation, Twitter understood its position as a message dissemination infrastructure. It was happy for third parties to “carry” its messages to consumers and businesses via software integrations with its APIs. The potential reach of a Tweet was the addition of people who went to twitter.com, as well as people who used a piece of software provided by a third party to disseminate tweets. Others were allowed to index tweets and provide filtered views showing tweets that pertained to a topic or an interest. It was an open and widely distributed platform, somewhat like the internet itself. Search engines could index and point to it just as they do web pages. The biggest version of Twitter one could imagine? This stage of Twitter’s development evoked its true potential, and was the manifestation of the biggest version of Twitter one could imagine. A universal data bus for everything important now. With an index and search open to developers. The business model for this stage was obvious. An ad every n tweets no matter which environment the Tweet stream was consumed through, with Twitter as the “AdSense” and “AdWords” of the whole thing. This would have resulted in Google-sized revenues quickly. The smallest version of Twitter one could imagine? But at that time, there was a belief that Twitter needed to become a destination. This implied that any ability for a third party to take tweets and re-broadcast them through another app or site was bad. It implied that indexing and searching tweets was to be blocked, it set Twitter against its disseminators. By doing so, it limited the Twitter audience to those who directly engaged with the properties owned and operated by the company. This was the smallest version of Twitter one could imagine. It seems clear that many at the board level wanted Twitter to be a destination, a Yahoo if you will. And to create content “channels” that would attract the audience for the channel. And to prevent any other means of accessing those channels. This allowed Twitter to become a branded destination and created the conditions where its key KPIs were not “tweets seen” but became “logged-in users” on a Twitter-owned property. The advertising platform Twitter has so impressively built over the past 3-4 years is based on top of this approach. The $2 billion or so in revenues it generates is impressive, but tiny compared to what would result from a truly universal data bus available everywhere. This would be a replacement of Google for content discovery, whereas the current Twitter is at best a replacement for Yahoo as a destination for content — and a poor one at that. IPO was premature? Twitter’s IPO was done before the company had truly completed its transition to becoming a content-rich destination site. The suspicion is that the need to IPO early was driven by board decisions and not organic management choice. Dick Costolo did an excellent job of trying to manage a ship in a storm that had only partial navigation, but the stock price ultimately reflected two things. Firstly, a company that could not accurately predict revenues and, secondly, one that had a KPI (logged-in users) that was always going to be its worst metric. The market took the direction of the board and management that Twitter wanted to be a branded portal business with advertising and measured it accordingly. Most of the 2013-2016 ailments of Twitter emanate from this product decision and the decision to IPO before it was completely built and functioning. The management changes, the stock performance, the yearning to sell the company. The case for “Yes” Twitter is a dysfunctional company with an interfering board and, like any dysfunctional family, it needs a divorce. A buyer would gain a clean slate and would be able to build the biggest possible version of Twitter, free of internal squabbles. This is the strongest case for a sale. But who should be the buyer if this outcome is wanted? There are only two good answers. One is Google, the other is a private equity buy-out. Google is the obvious buyer. A universal data bus carrying everything that is important now to the entire world, with ads every n Tweets would probably have revenues close to and eventually surpassing web-search revenues. With the emergence of live video — an area YouTube should excel in — the impact of this would be compounded by the video ad opportunity. And the vision would be well-aligned with Google’s “organize the World’s Information, and make it Accessible” vision. If Google is truly out of the race, Larry or Sergey or David Drummond — call me and let me explain why you should re-consider. I’m always available at http://chat.center/keith. Twitter is a dysfunctional company with an interfering board and, like any dysfunctional family, it needs a divorce. If Google really is out of the running, the next best sale is to PE. Silverlake, KKR or Blackrock should look at how they worked with Skype previously and consider taking Twitter private, removing the short-term thinking and re-launch it as the biggest version of Twitter it can be. That company could own digital advertising and audience engagement for decades to come. If neither option materializes, Twitter should take itself private — Qihoo360 just did this, as did Dell. There would be no shortage of banks interested in helping. What’s next for Twitter? The board should not sell Twitter to a media or content buyer. By doing so they would cheat the world by taking away a wonderful chance to build a universal data and messaging bus able to scale to the challenges of 4 billion smartphone owners wanting news, entertainment, live video and more. Management should go back to Twitter’s founding principles and build that universal, open, biggest possible version of Twitter. And the markets should give the company the space to perform such a transition. Twitter is not Yahoo. It is a baby, struggling to grow up. Infanticide is wrong. Let the children grow. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Twitter Founded 2006 Overview Twitter is a global social networking platform that allows its users to send and read 140-character messages known as “tweets”.

Stock Apple investors should worry less about industry competition than the industry itself. Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Oct 7, 2016 at 8:30AM Alphabet's New Google Pixel phone. Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) new Pixel phone is here. In June, a report from The Telegraph noted the company was looking to "take more control over the design, manufacturing, and software" than in prior years. And it appears Alphabet did that by rebranding the phone with its high-end Pixel designation, killing the Nexus line of phones, and integrating its Google Assistant technology. For more insight into the phone's features and specifications, fellow Fool writer Evan Niu has you covered. Still, Alphabet's foray into smartphones hasn't moved the needle as of now. The company quickly retreated from being an integrated hardware and software provider when it sold its Motorola Mobility division to Lenovo within two years of its purchase after a string of operating losses. Later attempts to leverage its name cache and its ecosystem advantage with the Nexus phone line have produced, by most accounts, strong products that have failed to translate into significant sales. As such, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) should not be as concerned about Alphabet's new Pixel Phone as it should be about a poor outlook for device sales. Gartner's forecast brings (mostly) bad news for Apple Research and advisory firm Gartner recently released its updated worldwide device shipments estimate, and the results are bad news for all device manufacturers. Overall, the combined-shipment totals for tablets, ultra-mobile PCs, and PCs are forecast to drop approximately 3% this year before growing 1% per year through 2018. For a company as tethered to high-margin device sales as Apple is, this is a much bigger risk to the company than industry competition. Device Type 2015 2016 2017 2018 Traditional PCs (Desk-Based and Notebook) 244 216 205 199 Ultramobiles (Premium) 44 49 61 75 PC Market 288 265 266 274 Ultramobiles (Basic and Utility) 196 177 173 173 Computing Devices Market 484 442 439 447 Mobile Phones 1,917 1,887 1,910 1,933 Total Devices Market 2,401 2,329 2,349 2,380 Data source: Gartner. Units are in millions. If there is a single positive in the chart above, it's that the mobile-phone category appears to outperform the entire device market. Gartner expects device shipments to drop only 1.6% this year before growing 1.2% per annum through 2018. These figures are certainly nothing to write home about, but they are marginally better than a declining market. Additionally, the ultramobile PC market, which includes Apple's MacBook Air, is slated for continued strong growth, but it won't be nearly enough to offset higher-margin iPhone weakness, should it continue. Apple could be a beneficiary of overly bearish sentiment Interestingly enough, Apple could be the beneficiary of Gartner's bearish outlook. Versus the greater S&P's price-to-earnings ratio of 25 times, Apple currently trades at a PE ratio of 13 times. In the event Apple is able to register earnings growth above expectations -- even slightly -- valuation repricing could add billions in market capitalization. On the other hand, if Apple only matches prior-year earnings, it's hard to imagine further valuation compression for a company that now trades at half the level of the S&P 500. It's also important for Apple investors to note that market forecasts are not destiny. For years, Apple was able to grow at a faster clip than the overall mobile-phone market as the company continued to gobble up market share. However, if Garter's forecast is accurate, it should be noted that any significant growth will come from riding Apple's coattails, and not from industrywide tailwinds. If Apple is able to bring an exciting new technology to the next iteration of its iPhone, the stock could be tremendously undervalued.

The apparent golden age of digital marketing let travel brands focus solely on two things: optimising pages based on their content, so they could appear as high as possible in natural search results; and bidding against competitors on keywords so that their text ads would appear on the right-hand side of the organic results. This period actually lasted a fairly long time, at least in web terms, but things started to change at the turn of the decade. A flurry of additions to SERPS (search engine results pages), especially on travel-related search queries, saw the appearance of elements such as maps, local information, images, videos and Wikipedia data. And then came Google’s own services, such as modules for Google Flight Search and Hotel Finder. Later items include Twitter cards, Google News-sourced articles and the Knowledge Graph. Google’s search results pages, in short, have changed dramatically (albeit gradually) from how they looked half a decade ago. Digital marketing software provider SearchMetrics recently analysed page one of Google SERPS for half a million frequently searched terms to understand how much the real estate has changed. One of the top-line findings is that the number of organic links displayed on page one has fallen from the original ten to around 8.5, with the real estate taken up with other modules and items. In addition, almost every search query now produces at least one related image, video, Twitter card, or news item. But SearchMetrics found there are some major differences in how SERPS work on desktop and mobile devices. EMEA marketing director, Lars Hartkopf, says: “Gone are the days when optimising for search was all about trying to appear in the classic ten blue organic links on Google’s first page. “Now marketers must also plan their strategies to include opportunities around a variety of Universal and Extended Search boxes, understanding how to create and optimise content which Google will consider useful for each.” So, what can digital marketers do about it? SearchMetrics came up with five areas to look at: 1. Integration boxes Google is probably trying to discourage image-laden pages with long download times (often a key feature of travel websites), so is less likely to feature them in organic results. Mobile results also include more Google Maps and Twitter Card integrations but fewer Product Listing Ads integrations related to search queries. Marketers, therefore, should make sure they strike a balance between content types and fully understand the impact of that strategy in SERPS. 2. App suggestions On mobile searches, Google often integrates what is known as an App Pack box, essentially to show different smartphone apps that are available in the respective Apple of Google app stores that are related to the search query. Marketers need to ensure that their own application is optimised to appear (using known techniques) in those packs. It’s a virtuous circle, too – the more downloads, the higher the chance that Google will feature it the pack. 3. Video boxes With around a quarter of search results featuring at least one featured video (nine out of ten, inevitably, coming via Google-owned YouTube), travel marketers have to ensure they do a lot more than produce clips. To boost the chance of a video being featured against a search term, creators must ensure they include the relevant and optimised descriptions and tags, as well as selecting a thumbnail for the static image and, as has been seen more recently, subtitles. 4. Knowledge Graph These modules are hugely important for travel brands, mainly as they appear frequently against search terms relating to destinations and attractions within a location. Google obtains the information from various online sources, allowing known brands to have some influence on what appears when users carry out a search. Such information includes logos/images, social network profiles and contact information. Another frequently integrated module is from Wikipedia, although SearchMetrics notes that officially this is a web user-generated page and supposedly hard to control. 5. Direct Answer boxes These often appear when a user fires up a query that includes the words “how” or “what”. Well-placed above organic listings, results are known to generate a fair amount of organic traffic to a website. Securing a spot there is harder, with content needing to be optimised, resting on a high authority site (page rank) and structured using specific web code.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Kevin May Kevin is senior editor and a co-founder at Tnooz.

Actually, the development of SERP can be regarded both as a challenge and as an opportunity for travel related website owners. Researches show that for example in Direct Answers you can find information (and a link of course) from a website rather far down from the top organic positions. Therefore, it cannot be said that on-page optimization as a part of your SEO efforts is no longer needed. Only properly structured and optimized information can get to the boxes in vertical search results. The same can be applied to images and videos: webmaster will need to know how to use all the image attributes correctly so it will appear in images section of the SERP for the relevant keywords, and have their video pages optimized too. Now all the types of the content are to be considered (images, videos, social media profile updates etc), all the types of data presentation (tables, lists etc) to cover the most of the blocks presented on the SERP.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Verizon responsible for Pixel system updates, according to Google By John Hoff - October 7, 2016 3 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter So when Google let the Pixel phones out of the bag, they also shred to the public the somewhat iffy news that Google’s brand spanking new smartphones will be exclusively sold by Verizon only, with the exception of the Google Play Store where you can buy them unlocked. So while the phones enjoyed some spectacular initial reviews, the news about being exclusively partnered with Verizon did raise some questions from the public. One of the more logical questions would be, who would be handling the updates for the devices? The guys over at 9 to 5 Google had a Google spokesperson answer the question, and here is the direct answer below: “Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store.” So it’s a mixed bag, that answer. While Google will still be the one pushing security updates to all Pixel phones (including Verizon models), it will be Verizon who will be handling system updates. That means any update to Android and future Android versions will be coming from the mobile carrier. All of this unless you buy your Pixel from the Google Play Store. At that point, we’re pretty sure you’ll be getting your updates straight from the mothership as well. So if you’ve decided you can take the challenge of the Pixel’s pricing, we can definitely say that it will be an advantage for you if you buy straight from Google, since the monthly financing details would pretty much come to around the same amount.

However months later, only a handful of Chromebooks have received Google Play support, and Google is taking rather slow steps to make it available to all the compatible Chromebooks. Luckily, there is another cheat way to get Play Store to work on Chromebooks, and start using Android apps immediately. Of course, before we begin to tell you the way, it is important to warn you that the method is unsafe. It requires you to use the Canary canal, which is extremely unstable. If the method backfires, it could cause some damage to your machine, and we recommend you to move forward at your own risk.This method won't work on all models, but should at least work on the 50 models that Google listed earlier in the year. If you have one of these laptops, and want Google Play installed immediately, enable developer mode on your Chromebook by pressing Esc+F5+Power. Then Press Ctrl+D and follow the instructions. After the Chromebook boots, press Ctrl+D again to jump verification. Switch to Canary Canal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T, and type Shell in the command prompt. Then type 'sudo su' and then enter 'update_engine_client -channel=canary-channel -update' to switch to canary channel. Again press Ctrl+Alt+T > Type Shell > Type sudo su > then 'echo '-enable-arc' > /usr/local/chrome_dev.conf > mount -o bind /usr/local/chrome_dev.conf /etc/chrome_dev.conf'. Now press Ctrl + Shift + Q two times to log out. After signing out, sign back in and restart your machine. After the reboot, the Chromebook should have the Google Play Store installed. If you do not see it immediately, browse through the Settings menu to see if there is an option to enable Google Play. This process was posted by Google Plus users, and was first spotted by Chrome Story. Justin Slatten on Google Plus also notes that Toshiba Chromebook 2015 users need not switch to the Canary canal, and can find Google Play on the developer channel as well. 9to5Google has done a full video with step by step instructions as well. User can switch back to the stable Chrome OS channel anytime, by hitting Ctrl+Alt+T > Type Shell > Type sudo su > Enter following command: update_engine_client -channel=stable-channel -update > and then press space bar at boot.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 14, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Penguin 4.0: a link builder’s perspective Industry SEO 07 Oct 16 | Cory Collins Facebook0 Linkedin167 Google+34 Twitter 201 It’s been two weeks since Penguin 4.0 was officially announced. Dr. Pete continues to report high Mozcast temperatures, and stories of recoveries are starting to spread across the net. Today I want to take a step back and share my thoughts about Penguin 4.0, as a marketer at a link building agency. As an industry we have been laser-focused on the roll out, recoveries, and any tidbits of information we can glean from Google and their representatives. This is all important information, but I want to share my broader thoughts about Penguin 4.0 now that it’s here, and what it reveals about the SEO industry as a whole. In no particular order, here are my thoughts: Penguin devaluing links instead of demoting a site is an important step to a better relationship with Google, for all marketers and site owners. I don’t believe the move to devaluing spam will make grey hat or black hat more viable. Manipulation will be harder than ever, so focusing on good links will remain critical. Penguin 4.0 counters Negative SEO. Devaluing the links removes the (algorithmic) barb from NSEO. The era of Penguin is coming to a close. I suspect to see fewer large algorithms moving forward. Links are vital to Google’s algorithm, and the entire web. Penguin 4.0 reinforces that. Is that enough to cover? Let’s see. Penguin devaluing links instead of demoting (punishing) sites makes the web a better place Google wants to punish spam. I understand that. But algorithmic demotions shouldn’t have been part of the equation. Penguin never should have been punitive—it never should have demoted sites. Building in a layer of penalization (even if Google didn’t call it such) led to  fear, uncertainty, doubt, frustration, misinformation, and an overall worse relationship between Google and SEOs, marketers, entrepreneurs, and site owners. This poor relationship was further exacerbated by confusing recovery information, uncertainty surrounding whether your site was affected, and lengthy, unknowable wait times between data refreshes (and updates), which was the only way to recover. The Penguin 4.0 move to devalue spam links—as opposed to demoting entire sites—is the best news to come out of Penguin 4 so far. This is what SEOs, business owners, and marketers have wanted from Penguin since day one. If Google doesn’t want to spam to affect their results, then they should do just that: find a way to make sure spam doesn’t impact their results. Find a way to ignore spam. This comment from Danny Sullivan on Matt Cutts’ infamous rant against guest blogging in 2014 is the perfect summation:   Danny’s right: Google can’t take a zero tolerance policy on links. Not when links prove so vital to the web. Especially when Google’s advice everywhere else is promote, promote, promote. Penguin 4.0, fully integrated into the core algorithm, is a good step in the right direction. Google shouldn’t seek to mold the web to match their algorithm—they should mold their algorithm to the web. Penguin 4.0 will hopefully improve the relationship between Google, SEOs, site owners, and businesses. Devaluation instead of demotion ISN’T going to lead to a new wave of manipulation It’s an easy logic chain to follow: Now that Google’s not punishing spammy backlinks- only devaluing – there’s less risk in building said spammy links. Worst case scenario the links are ignored by Google. Add in the fact that Penguin happens in “real time” and is granular, and it’ll be easy to test which links are easy to secure but still add value to a page. From there all that’s left is to mass build those links and manipulate the algorithm. Right? This is NOT reality. This will not be the case. First, if the logic chain is easy to follow, I guarantee the ranking engineers and webspam team at Google have considered it and made sure such manipulation won’t be possible. Second, manual penalties still exist. It would be easy for the webspam team to follow in the wake of large-scale Penguin link devaluations and hand out manual penalties. Finally, I don’t believe it will be as easy as assumed above to observe and predict the effect of Penguin, for three reasons: Real time isn’t instantaneous. Devaluation has less impact than demotion. Granular is less noticeable than site-wide. The release of Penguin 4 has had the lowest impact of any Penguin to date. Anecdotes and data are still only beginning to spread across the industry, despite the official release on September 23rd. In my opinion, it’s going to be harder than ever before to accurately observe and measure the effect of Penguin. It’s going to be hard to track the impact and understand whether or not a link type is having the intended effect. There will be instances where Penguin can be manipulated and tested in isolation. Even then, it will be difficult to be sure. To take that data, the information, and apply it to the live web? It’s not going to work. Manipulation isn’t a good bet anymore. It hasn’t been since the first release of Penguin. If you want real visibility in search, you’re better served spending time investing real value into your website and promoting appropriately. So skip the manipulation. Do the hard work of creating value and promoting that value to the right audiences, in a way that will result in links. Optimize opportunity, and work strategically. Don’t try and manipulate the algorithm with tricks and hacks. Negative SEO won’t work with the new Penguin The entire concept of negative SEO was predicated on triggering a manual penalty or algorithmic demotion by pointing spammy links at a website. If the new Penguin only devalues spammy links, then pointing those links at a competitor will achieve nothing. Wait, scratch that. It will achieve something: it will waste your time. Which is as it should be. There shouldn’t be more potential benefit in harming a competitor than building up your own brand and visibility. Although its existence was often questioned, the opportunity of Negative SEO was too high. Spam links are easy to create, easy to control, and if they result in a manual action or algorithmic demotion, then spam links had a high impact as well. Penguin 4.0 and the move to devaluing bad links should end much of the value of Negative SEO. The only potential exception would be if you’re able to earn your competitor a manual penalty—but that’s something Penguin can’t fix. At least with this update, the Penguin factor in Negative SEO has been removed. And I for one couldn’t be happier – I want to create, not destroy.

They typically result in negative publicity, critical scrutiny of their algorithms, and unhappy site owners. With Penguin 4.0, Google has officially moved Penguin into the core algorithm. With this change, Google has also made it clear there will be no further Penguin announcements in the future. The era of Penguin is coming to a close. But more than that, I believe Google won’t unveil large, named updates to the public as often. Machine learning, deep learning, and AI continues to improve, and I suspect it will be harder and harder to understand when a new element is introduced to the algorithm. Consider the past few years. Matt Cutts has moved on, to be nominally replaced by John Mueller and Gary Illyes. Gary was clearly burned in his attempt to coordinate a Penguin release date. RankBrain was announced only after it was solidly in the algorithm, and only then to shine positive light on Google and their accomplishments. Amit Singhal has been replaced by the former head of AI. There is very little benefit for Google in confirming or releasing large updates. Traditionally, we only notice a handful of significant updates across the year. Google’s inside search states they made 665 changes in 2012 alone. I believe Penguin 4.0 marks the beginning of an era in which Google can update their algorithm with machine learning and AI, and not be forced to rely on large, manual updates that occur outside of the core algorithm. If Google is able to reduce their large, noticeable updates, then we can certainly expect less communication as well. Links will be vital to the web for the foreseeable future Ever since the original release of Penguin in 2012, SEOs have been predicting the release of a new, vital signal into search. And all we got was RankBrain. Here we are in 2016, and Google continues to invest into fine-tuning their link quality algorithm. Guys, just create great content. Links are dead. Just ignore that Google is still putting resources in 2016 towards better assessing them. — Jon Cooper (@PointBlankSEO) September 24, 2016 In fact, a Google Search Quality Senior Strategist just recently stated that links are one of the top two ranking factors (he named links and content as the top ranking factors). It’s safe to say we can quit predicting the death of links. Links remain vital to the Internet, humanity’s ability to use the web, and search engines’ ability to serve quality results in search. If driving traffic, building an audience, and growing relationships are important to your website, then links need to be addressed in your marketing strategy. Penguin 1.0 didn’t change that, nor did Penguin 4.0. The only change is quality—today, securing real links that represent a vote of confidence is more important than ever before.

This week we have Facebook, Amazon and Meerkat all trying something new. Spoiler alert: respectively, being Craigslist, banning reviews, not existing anymore. But first, let’s check in with the Big G… Google’s first SERP now displays fewer organic results Page one of Google search now displays fewer organic results (around 8.5 links instead of the 10 it used to traditionally show) according to new research from Searchmetrics. Nearly every search query now includes at least one example of boxed out content such as app suggestions, videos, images, integrated Twitter cards etc on the first page. There are also significant differences between Google’s smartphone and desktop results, with 34% of desktop results including at least one images box compared with only 14.4% for smartphones. Facebook targets eBay, Craigslist with Marketplace This week saw the launch of Facebook Marketplace, “a convenient destination to discover, buy and sell items with people in your community.” As reported by Al Roberts, through Marketplace, sellers can post the details and photos of the items that they’re looking to sell, and buyers can search for items for sale near them or in a specific location. A search function is available, and there are a number of filters offered, including category and price. Amazon now forbids incentivized reviews Amazon announced an update to its community guidelines that will put an end to incentivized reviews for products other than books. According to Chee Chew, Amazon’s VP of Customer Experience: “Our community guidelines have always prohibited compensation for reviews, with an exception – reviewers could post a review in exchange for a free or discounted product as long as they disclosed that fact. These so-called ‘incentivized reviews’ make up only a tiny fraction of the tens of millions of reviews on Amazon, and when done carefully, they can be helpful to customers by providing a foundation of reviews for new or less well-known products.” As Al Roberts points out however, Amazon will continue to permit authors and book publishers to provide advance review copies of new books, which is a standard industry practice. And for those not selling books, it will allow incentivized reviews through its Amazon Vine program.

Too late! Less than two years after its launch, Meerkat is no longer with us. Last week, the company behind it, Life On Air, pulled the Meerkat app from the App Store, as it focuses on its newest app, Houseparty, which as the name hints, offers multi-person video chat. As Al Roberts reports, despite protestations otherwise, it’s clear that Facebook Live and Twitter’s live app Periscope are to blame for the pivot. Google cracks down on fraudulent plumbers and locksmiths Google is rolling out an advanced verification process specific to plumbers and locksmiths. As Matt Southern reported for SEJ this week, all locksmiths and plumbers currently verified will have to go through the new verification process. Failure to do so before November 1 will result in the loss of verification and the removal from Google Maps. Why locksmiths and plumbers? Well apparently the ‘locksmith scam’ is a prevalent method for ripping people off, using Google My Business as bait. Here’s how it works, courtesy of SEJ: After being locked out of one’s home and not knowing what to do, a quick Google search brings up a list of local locksmiths. Google returns AdWords ads and Google My Business listings for locksmiths promising cheap or inexpensive service rates. Calling one of these bargain locksmiths actually routes you to an offshore call center, where they dispatch someone local to come to your door. The locksmith shows up and, before trying any other options, immediately drills the lock open and slaps you with a large bill for the service. Hmm. I don’t know why I just taught you that.

We compare it with the iPhone 7 Plus. The launch of the Google Pixel XL and its smaller sibling marks the first time Android users can really point to one phone as being the best representation of its operating system. In partnership with HTC, Google took a major role in designing the Pixel lineup, to the point that you'll only see Google branding. With the Pixel XL now taking over the emblem of flagship Android phablet, we put it against the Apple iPhone 7 Plus to see how the two super-sized phones compare. Name Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Apple iPhone 7 Plus   Lowest Price %displayPrice% %seller% $649.00 MSRP %displayPrice% %seller% $769.00 MSRP %displayPrice% %seller% $769.00 MSRP Editor Rating   Operating System as Tested Android 7.1 (Nougat) Android 7.1 (Nougat) iOS 10 CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Apple A10 Dimensions 5.6 by 2.7 by 0.3 inches 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches 6.23 by 3.07 by 0.29 inches Weight 5.4 oz 5.9 oz 6.63 oz Screen Size 5 inches 5.5 inches 5.5 inches Screen Type AMOLED Quad HD AMOLED Retina Screen Resolution 1,920 by 1,080 pixels 2,560 by 1,440 pixels 1,920 by 1,080 pixels Screen Pixels Per Inch 441 ppi 543 ppi 401 ppi Camera Resolution 12.3MP Rear, 8MP Front-Facing 12.3MP Rear, 8MP Front-Facing Dual 12MP Rear, 7MP Front-Facing Wireless Specification 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Bluetooth Version 4.2 4.2 4.2 NFC Yes Yes Yes   Read the Review Read the Review Read the Review Design, Features, and Display Google's inspiration for the Pixel XL's design is immediately apparent; it looks like a hybrid between the iPhone 7 Plus and 6s Plus. It has a metal unibody similar to both iPhones, the characteristic antenna lines from 6s Plus, the same camera placement (absent the hump), two bottom-firing speakers like the 7 Plus, and a sizable bezel on the top and bottom lip of the phone. allowfullscreen</g>" gr_="" gr_315="" gr-alert="" gr_spell="" gr_run_anim="" contextualspelling="" ins-del="" multireplace="" id="315" data-gr-id="315">allowfullscreen</g>?wmode=transparent"> The big differences are that the 7 Plus features a haptic Home button/fingerprint scanner on the front, while the Pixel XL has the fingerprint sensor on the back. Both phones have their charging ports on the bottom—USB-C for the Pixel XL and Lightning for the 7 Plus. The XL retains the 3.5mm headphone jack that Apple dropped from its iPhone 7 lineup. There are some small distinguishing qualities, like a panel of glass that partially covers the back of the XL, as well as the placement of the power button and volume rocker on the right. Either way, both phones are fairly similar in overall dimensions. The Pixel XL measures 6.1 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 5.9 ounces, while the 7 Plus (6.2 by 3.1 by 0.3 inches) comes in heavier at 6.6 ounces. Neither are really phones you can use one-handed, so be sure your thumb is ready to stretch to reach the opposite side. When it comes to physical features, the biggest difference between the two phones is waterproofing. The iPhone 7 Plus has it, the Pixel XL does not. The 7 Plus is IP67 waterproof, letting it survive for 30 minutes under three feet of water. The displays on both devices are 5.5 inches, but their panels are fairly different. The Pixel XL has a 2,560-by-1,440 Quad HD AMOLED display, giving it a rich pixel density of 534ppi. That's much sharper than the 1,920-by-1,080 Retina display on the iPhone 7 Plus, which only has 401ppi. That said, both displays have their strengths and weakness. The 7 Plus's panel is extraordinarily well-calibrated, bright, and has a wide color gamut. It benefits from excellent viewing angles and visibility in direct sunlight. In contrast, AMOLED panels benefit from true black, lighting pixels only as necessary, giving it somewhat richer and more saturated colors and battery savings. Both should look good in their own right. Processor and Battery The Pixel XL is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor with 4GB of RAM, and comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage. It's a chipset we expect to be more powerful than the Snapdragon 820 processor, which we've regularly benchmarked on AnTuTu (to test overall system performance) as scoring in the 120k to 150k range. The XL should also benefit from Google's lightweight Android UI. The Apple A10 Fusion processor is the fastest processor available on a phone in the US, and the fastest one we've tested. We found it to be 40 percent faster than the Snapdragon 820, taking advantage of two high-performance cores clocked at 2.3GHz and two low-power cores for applications like Bluetooth audio. We'll need to do our own testing, but preliminary benchmarks show that the Snapdragon 821 is significantly outmatched by the A10's Fusion processor in both multi-core performance and single core performance. Again, these are early unverified results, so stay posted for our own testing. Battery life is another factor that's hard to test without having the phone. For its part, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 2,900mAh cell under the hood, giving it a solid battery runtime of six hours during our rundown test, where we stream full-screen video over LTE at maximum brightness. The Pixel XL has a larger 3,450mAh battery, but as we've noted in our previous reviews, testing Android phones against iPhones in terms of battery life is particularly difficult because iPhones tend to have more power-hungry screens with a higher maximum brightness, but Android devices bleed more energy with background processes. Camera Camera performance is shaping up to the biggest factor when it comes to differentiating between the iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel XL. On paper, the XL has a 12.3-megapixel rear-facing sensor with a f/2.0 aperture, laser autofocus, and dual-LED flash. It's capable of recording in 4K at 30fps and has an 8-megapixel front camera. Google has also emphasized the time and effort it spent in perfecting the camera for low-light shots. There's no OIS, but video is stabilized by using the gyroscope. The iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent shooter. It has two 12-megapixel rear cameras on the back, one with OIS and another with 2x optical zoom. There's also a 7-megapixel front camera. It's not quite as sharp as the Galaxy S7's camera in our lab tests, but it's still one of the best sensors you can get. The use of the optical zoom also gives it much finer detail than the digital zoom of rival Android phones. The 7 Plus is capable of 4K video recording. However, the Pixel XL did top DxOmark's ranking, scoring 89, which is better than the 86 scored by the iPhone 7, which has the same 12-megapixel primary camera. We'll be putting both phones to the test in a shootout when we get our hands on the XL. Software Android and iOS are dramatically different platforms, but they've drawn closer in recent years. The general rule of thumb has been that if you prefer to customize every aspect of your phone, then Android is the way to go. On the other hand, iOS is preferable for a less fragmented experience, better app support, and more reliable updates. This may not be true for the Google Pixel XL. It comes running a version of Android 7.0 Nougat and will get updates directly from Google, so you can expect to be first to get new versions of Android. It also incldues 24/7 live customer support on the phone itself, and can take advantage of Google's advanced machine learning protocols for Google Assistant. However, this also means you may not get the same flexibility and degree of control you used to on Nexus devices like the 6P and 5X since Google is keeping a tighter grip on the OS. allowfullscreen</g>"> The iPhone 7 Plus runs iOS 10, which is very much Apple's own closed garden ecosystem. It comes with revamped messages, effects, third-party app integration, improved widgets, actionable notifications, an improved photos apps, and the ability to delete Apple's pre-installed apps. There's definitely been a convergence in terms of features and functionality between both platforms, and the Google Pixel XL only makes the gap even smaller. Price and Conclusions The Google Pixel XL comes in three colors—Very Silver, Quite Black, and the limited-edition Really Blue—at a starting price of $769 for its 32GB model. The 128GB model is $100 more, at $869. It is available for pre-order through the Google Store, Verizon, and Best Buy. //Related Articles Hands On: Google's Pixel Smartphone The iPhone 7 Plus is almost identically priced. It comes in jet black, black, silver, gold and rose gold. Its 32GB model is $769, 128GB is $869, and 256GB is $969. It's clear that with its pricing, Google is trying to position the Pixel XL as a legitimate competitor to the iPhone 7 Plus. We'll have to reserve judgment on if Google succeeds in this endeavor when we get the Pixel XL to test here at PC Labs, so stay tuned for our full review.

New Jersey’s Student Loan Agency Has Started Getting Good Reviews — By Giving Free Stuff The agency, which promotes loans with onerous terms, is giving out flash drives for online reviews. by Annie Waldman ProPublica, Oct. 7, 2016, 7:23 a.m. Print Print search Follow ProPublica Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook volumelow Podcast RSS RSS Email Updates by email optional Our Hottest Stories Most Read                     Rob Weychert/ProPublica Update, Oct. 11, 2016: Following our reporting, two New Jersey state senators sent a letter to the student loan agency, criticizing it for rewarding favorable online reviews with gifts. The senators called the scheme “a public relations stunt” and a “waste of time and resources.” They asked the agency to discontinue the practice, and instead focus on fixing the loan program. Over the past few years, dozens of borrowers have written devastating reviews of the New Jersey state agency whose student loans, as we have detailed, have strikingly onerous terms. “This place doesn’t even deserve one star,” posted Ashante Patterson on Google’s review platform. “It is a scam and horrendous organization that preys on and belittles borrowers.” “You are better off not going to college,” wrote another reviewer, Nik Sharma, about the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, also known as HESAA. “They are the absolute worst and are inhumane.” “Robbery, simply said,” critiqued Dane Gruenebaum, another borrower from HESAA. “They operate under the guise of the state, but use private funds.” But recently, the reviews have gone from scathing to raving. Over the past three weeks, the state agency has received about 140 glowing five-star reviews, in sharp contrast to the earlier online rebukes. What changed? Not much, except that the agency began to offer gifts to students in exchange for reviews. An agency official recently wrote to students asking them to post Google reviews “so that our State Legislature and our New Jersey families see the benefits of this great program.” “Email me back with a print screen of your shared verifiable posting so I can send you the 4 gigabyte HESAA flash drive,” wrote Andre Maglione, the agency’s “acting director of client services.” Giving away gifts in return for reviews is widely considered to be a questionable practice, and indeed is a violation of Google’s policies. According to the company’s guidelines, users should never “offer or accept money, products, or services to write reviews for a business,” stressing that honest and unbiased reviews are the most valuable to consumers. “We have a policy against conflict of interest in reviews,” said Mara Harris, a Google spokeswoman. She did not comment specifically on the agency’s reviews, but urged users to flag any reviews that violate guidelines so that the company could remove them from their platform. In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission has bolstered its regulation of online endorsements. The agency doesn’t ban “incentivized reviews,” but it does require that “the incentive is clearly and conspicuously disclosed in the review,” said Mary Engle, director of the FTC’s division of advertising practices. In February 2015, the commission sanctioned a car shipment broker for touting reviews from consumers who didn’t disclose that they had received discounts in exchange for reviews. This past March, the FTC reached a settlement with department store Lord & Taylor’s after the retailer paid fashion “influencers” to post photos on Instagram while wearing a free dress from the store without revealing their financial incentive. New Jersey’s student loan agency never told reviewers they were required to disclose the incentives. None of the student reviewers revealed that they had received a gift in exchange for a shining write-up. Bonnie Patten, executive director of nonprofit consumer group Truth In Advertising, told ProPublica that the state agency’s scheme may violate federal regulations. Examples of the online reviews. “At a minimum, you’re dealing with a deceptive advertisement and endorsement because they failed to disclose clearly and conspicuously material information that would be important to other consumers,” said Patten. “Other students are going to look at these reviews and make major decisions based on these reviews.” The agency did not respond to questions about why it did not tell students to disclose the flash drive giveaway in reviews. Jennifer Azzarano, the agency’s communications director, said in an emailed response to our questions that the giveaway was just a “small part of a much larger, ongoing effort to build awareness of the early availability of FAFSA,” the official application for federal student aid. But in the “giveaway” emails students shared with ProPublica, the agency does not mention the federal application for student aid. Azzarano said everyone who reviewed the agency received a flash drive with a reminder to file their federal application for student aid. “A thumb drive was provided no matter how a reviewer responded,” said Azzarano. When asked whether giving free flash drives might encourage positive reviews, Azzarano said that it would not. (Read the agency’s full response to our questions.) Donita Crudup, a student at Thomas Edison State University, had never posted an online review before the agency notified her of the flash drive giveaway. She had received a tuition grant from the state – part of a $385 million program that is also administered by the loan agency – and thought that perhaps the state just needed some help encouraging other students to apply for the grants, also known as TAG. “Who can say no to free money?” Crudup posted online, giving the agency five stars. Crudup didn’t realize the agency was also responsible for administering a controversial private student loan program that, over the years, had left a number of families financially ruined – and racked up dozens of cautionary online reviews. The agency only requested reviews from students who received the need-based tuition grants, which a third of full-time undergrads at New Jersey schools receive. Students who received loans from the agency were not emailed about the giveaway. In July, an investigation by ProPublica and the New York Times found that the agency’s loans come with rigid terms and aggressive collection practices. The state’s loans have higher interest rates than similar federal programs and limited repayment options for those who struggle to pay. The agency can garnish wages, take tax refunds and suspend professional licenses, all without obtaining a court judgment. And unlike federal and many other state-based programs, the loans are not forgiven after a borrower dies. The New Jersey agency has defended its practices as necessary in order to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility to the bondholders that fund the state’s student loan program. (Read the agency’s responses to our previous questions.) Following the onslaught of five-star posts, one reviewer noticed something was amiss. “All of the positive reviews here are fake,” wrote Dan Fitzgerald. “It’s sad that HESAA conceals how terrible they are this way. Avoid HESAA like the plague.” After Crudup posted her review, she did some research about the agency, and discovered that her favorable post contrasted with the agency’s previous reviews, many of them from distressed student borrowers. “I thought it was really messed up in retrospect,” Crudup told ProPublica, who now regrets posting her positive review of the agency. “After reading that they have so many bad reviews, I don’t want to overshadow these real reviews.” A few days after her post, Crudup received a small package from the agency. Tucked inside was an orange, four-gigabyte flash drive. “It was totally not worth it given all the information that I learned after,” said Crudup, who said she is considering taking down her review.

SUBSCRIBE AMP is one year old and growing fast. Will it ultimately trump responsive design? There are now 600 million AMP pages on 700,000 domains. Greg Sterling on October 7, 2016 at 6:37 am More On the heels of new Google research that shows the primacy of mobile in a cross-device world, the company is celebrating the first birthday of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and offering a roundup of milestones and success metrics. There are now 600 million AMP pages on 700,000 domains. AMP publishers are seeing more repeat traffic and better engagement/CTRs. For example: Washington Post: 23-percent increase in mobile search users who return within seven days. Wired: 25-percent increase in click-through rates from search results, with CTR on ads in AMP stories up 63 percent. The Miami Herald: mobile users who start with an AMP article spend 10 percent more time than those who land on regular mobile pages. In a DoubleClick study: 80 percent+ of AMP publishers realized higher viewability rates; 90 percent of AMP publishers drove greater engagement with higher CTRs; one publisher saw 600 percent greater CTR after AMP. Last month, Google rolled out AMP in the main mobile search results. The company emphasized that AMP is not a ranking factor. However, Google said it will show links to AMP-enabled pages vs. other versions of the same page. Google spent a great deal of time over the past several years convincing developers and publishers to adopt responsive design to improve the mobile user experience. Responsive design and AMP are not mutually exclusive; however, AMP pages typically load faster than responsive pages. It’s possible that AMP will ultimately be preferred over responsive pages; however, the company has not taken an official position on this question. More controversially, Google’s Adam Greenberg said at SMX East that AMP pages will override app deep links “for the foreseeable future.” It can be argued whether this delivers the best user experience. AMP is at its core an initiative to improve the mobile web experience. While AMP is open-source and being adopted by a wide array of companies, Google sees the viability of the mobile web (vs. apps) as vital to its continued success.

Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Google has been developing a new virtual reality technology platform that will run on mobile devices. The company's innovative technology called Tango will make applications in smartphones and tablet to be "spatially aware," allowing mobile users to interact with his surroundings in 3D with the help of special camera lens and processor. After several months, the public will have the chance to experience this highly interesting VR feature with the release of Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. The device is now set to be released next month. According to The Verge, the Lenovo Tab 2 Pro will be the first mobile device coming from Google Project Tango. It was first reported that Lenovo's next iteration of smartphone t tablet hybrid would be released in Summer 2016. However, possible revisions and modifications have further delayed its launch until the last months of the year. Lenovo's upcoming phablet model, designed to run Tango, will be featuring wide-angle and depth-sensing camera incorporated into its main 16MP sensor. This camera feature will allow the mobile device to create a spatial 3D map of the user's environment and display it on the screen. The 3D map can be overlaid with visual effects, track objects, and even map indoor spaces. Various applications can be developed to further explore and experiment with this new 3D mapping technology in mobile devices. Project Tango was initiated in 2014, but it is only now that the outcome of Google's groundbreaking venture will be experienced. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro will be a thin and classic device with 6.4-inch quad HD display, Digital Trends reported. It may not be so different from the previous phablet models from Lenovo, having Snapdragon 652, 4GB RAM, and 4,000 mAh battery capacity, although its Tango technology will make it stand out from the rest. There are no confirmed reports yet regarding the other specs of the phablet and its price, although the latest rumors suggest that the regular variant of Phab 2 Pro will cost around $500.

Thanks to all of SitePoint’s peer reviewers for making SitePoint content the best it can be! More from this author Single Page Apps Using AngularJS and the WordPress REST API Website owners very often decide on using Google’s Custom Search Engine (GCSE) for searching through their content instead of using built-in and/or custom search functionality. The reason is simple – it’s much less work, and most often it does the trick. If you don’t need advanced filters or custom search parameters then GSCE is for you. In this quick tip, I will show you how to manually render the search form (without using a special GCSE tag) and a results box which allows for more control and a cleaner way to style the search input field. The Problem Usually adding GCSE to your site is as simple as copy pasting a script and a custom HTML tag into your site. In the place where you put the special GCSE tag, an input search field will render. Typing and starting a search from this field will do a Google search based on previously configured parameters (e.g. search sitepoint.com only). One question that often comes up is “How do I change the placeholder of the GCSE input field?”. Unfortunately very often the suggested answer is wrong as it uses an unreliable setTimeout method in order to wait for the Ajax call from the GCSE to complete (making sure the input is already attached to the DOM) and then changes attributes via JavaScript. We are also going to query the element and change the attributes with JS, but instead of doing a blind setTimeout() we will use the callback provided by the GCSE which will guarantee that the input has already loaded. Creating a GCSE Account The search engine is configured completely online. The first step is to go to the GCSE site and click add. Follow the wizard by filling in the domain on which you want to search (usually your site URL). You can ignore any advanced settings for now. When you click done, you are presented with three options: Get Code, which will guide you through what and where you have to copy in order for the search to show on your site Public URL will show you a working preview of the search that you set up Control Panel for customising the search Go to Control Panel, click Search Engine ID and make a note of this value for later. HTML Setup In order to try this out, we will create a basic index.html containing the HTML needed and an app.js file containing the functions needed to render and customise the search. Go ahead and create a basic HTML file with this inside: <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>GCSE test</h1>
    <div class="gcse-search-wrapper"></div>
    <div class="gcse-results-wrapper"></div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
 We added two <div>‘s with special classes in order to be recognized as the elements where the search form and results should be rendered. Functions for Manual Rendering Now go into your app.js file and add this: var config = {
  gcseId: '006267341911716099344:r_iziouh0nw',
  resultsUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',
  searchWrapperClass: 'gcse-search-wrapper',
  resultsWrapperClass: 'gcse-results-wrapper'
};

var renderSearchForms = function () {
  if (document.readyState == 'complete') {
    queryAndRender();
  } else {
    google.setOnLoadCallback(function () {
      queryAndRender();
    }, true);
  }
};

var queryAndRender = function() {
  var gsceSearchForms = document.querySelectorAll('.' + config.searchWrapperClass);
  var gsceResults = document.querySelectorAll('.' + config.resultsWrapperClass);

  if (gsceSearchForms) {
    renderSearch(gsceSearchForms[0]);
  }
  if (gsceResults) {
    renderResults(gsceResults[0]);
  }
};

var renderSearch = function (div) {
    google.search.cse.element.render(
      {
        div: div.id,
        tag: 'searchbox-only',
        attributes: {
          resultsUrl: config.resultsUrl
        }
      }
    );
    if (div.dataset &&
        div.dataset.stylingFunction &&
        window[div.dataset.stylingFunction] &&
        typeof window[div.dataset.stylingFunction] === 'function') {
      window[div.dataset.stylingFunction](form);
    }
};

var renderResults = function(div) {
  google.search.cse.element.render(
    {
      div: div.id,
      tag: 'searchresults-only'
    });
};

window.__gcse = {
  parsetags: 'explicit',
  callback: renderSearchForms
};

(function () {
  var cx = config.gcseId;
  var gcse = document.createElement('script');
  gcse.type = 'text/javascript';
  gcse.async = true;
  gcse.src = (document.location.protocol == 'https:' ? 'https:' : 'http:') +
    '//cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=' + cx;
  var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
  s.parentNode.insertBefore(gcse, s);
})();
 First, we declare some variables for the configuration. Put the ID you noted down earlier into the gcseId field of the config. Put the URL of your local index.html file into the resultsUrl field. This is where the search will redirect after a user submits a query. Additionally, GCSE will expect there to be a results field rendered on the provided URL. addSearchForms This function checks if the page has been loaded and, if so, calls the function that will take care of rendering queryAndRender() or, if the document is not yet loaded, then set a callback in order to return here later after the document has finished loading. queryAndRender This function queries the DOM for elements with the classes provided in the config. If a wrapper div is found, call renderSearch() and renderResults() for rendering the search and results fields respectively. renderSearch Here is where the actual magic happens. We use the Google Search API (more documentation on how to use the google.search.cse.element object here) to create the search box, and if there is a query active (results), the results box. The render function takes more arguments than are provided in this example, so be sure to check the documentation if further customization is needed. The div argument actually takes the ID of the div where we want the search rendered, and the tag argument is to denote what exactly do we want to render (results or search or both). Additionally, renderSearch() looks for the data attributes of the wrapper element, and if there is a styling-function attribute given, it will look for that function name in the scope and apply it on the element. This is our opportunity where we can style the element. window.__gcse = {
  parsetags: 'explicit',
  callback: renderSearchForms
};
 In this code snippet, we set a callback variable in the global scope, so that GCSE uses this internally and executes the callback function when it has finished loading. This is the part which makes this method so much better than the setTimeout() solution for editing the placeholder (or anything else) of the input field. Test Run So far, we have included everything needed to render a search box and the results. If you have node.js installed, go into the folder where you placed the index.html and app.js files, and run the http-server command. Which will server the content from the folder on localhost on port 8080 by default. Styling Function Now we are ready to add the custom styling function to the search div. Go back to index.html and on the #searchForm div, add a styling-function attribute <div styling-function="removePlaceholder"
id="searchForm" class="gcse-search-wrapper"></div>
 Now go into app.js and on top of the file, under the config variable declaration, add a new function: var removePlaceholder = function(div) {
  var inputField = div.querySelector("input.gsc-input");

  // Change the placeholder
  inputField.placeholder = "Search SitePoint";

  // Remove the background
  inputField.style.background = "none";

  // The background will get re-attached on blur, so add an event that will also remove it on blur
  // Another way to do this would be to de-attach the element from the DOM and then re-attach again, hence wiping the listeners
  inputField.addEventListener("blur", function() {
    inputField.style.background = "none";
  });
};
 Now try to load the test page again, and you will see a proper placeholder. Conclusion For setting up a simple search quickly, especially if the site is just static HTML, the Google Custom Search Engine works perfectly. With a little bit of JavaScript it’s possible to customize not only the search form, but also the results page, providing a more seamless experience for users.

October 7th, 2016 By Thomas Ricker on October 7, 2016 07:30 am @Trixxy 14 Tweet Share Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share This was the week we finally got a complete picture of what virtual reality looks like in 2016, the year VR is supposed to hit the mainstream. The week started with Google taking the wraps off the $79 Daydream View VR headset and wireless controller. Google also introduced the first Pixel phones that start at $649 and run Android 7.1 with built-in VR support. That’ll put Google in direct competition with Samsung’s Galaxy VR offering when the View ships in November. Those interested in a more robust VR experience were treated to the first reviews of Sony’s PlayStation VR headset on Wednesday. While its baseline cost is $399, you’ll probably end up paying $499 for the PSVR bundle that includes the tracking camera and two Move controllers. Adi Robertson calls PSVR the "the lowest common denominator of tethered headsets" but contends that sometimes good enough can be great. PlayStation VR starts shipping on October 13th. Yesterday the final piece of the puzzle fell into place with the announcement of the $199 price for the Oculus Touch controllers shipping on December 6th. That brings the Oculus Rift to price parity with the $799 HTC Vive. The complete picture As a bonus, we also got a glimpse of future VR when Mark Zuckerberg teased a midrange wireless VR headset still under development at Oculus. It sits between mobile experiences like Gear VR and Daydream View, and top-end systems like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive that tether the user to a PC. Robertson took a prototype for a spin, saying it could be VR’s next great leap. Still, it’s not coming out anytime soon so let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves. In January I ran a poll asking which VR headset you thought you’d likely buy: the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or Sony PlayStation VR. At the time, 37 percent of you wanted a Vive, 36 percent wanted a PSVR, and just 25 percent wanted an Oculus Rift. But that was long before we had the complete picture. So, dear reader, now that you know all the details, which high-end VR headset are you going to buy (or have already bought)? Poll WHICH VR HEADSET DO YOU THINK YOU’LL BUY?

Andromeda was an intriguing though highly debatable idea, a true unification of Google’s two operating systems, Android and Chrome. In the end, of course, it didn’t come to pass. But what Google did was not only not announce any such Android and Chrome OS merger, it actually revealed something that, in the long run, would make both of those irrelevant, or at least invisible, to the user, in a future where everyone has their own, personal, Google Assistant. The evolution of computing Like most product announcements these days, Google didn’t immediately jump into talking about the Google Pixel at is press event. In fact, the ratio of time the Pixel actually spent on stage was quite short. A good portion of the spiel was, instead, devoted to Google’s latest software baby: Google Assistant. Google Assistant isn’t exactly new, but Google’s laser focus on it at its event was somewhat unexpected. It wasn’t simply a feature tacked on, like its ancestor Google Now. It was so central to not only the Pixel but Google itself that it dared claim that this was the next step in the evolution of computing. In Google’s version of the history of computing, there have been three ages before this, separated by about 10 years. First, there was the arrival of the personal computer, followed by the Web. Today we are in the middle of the Mobile age. And, in Google’s crystal ball, the future will be defined by an “AI first” paradigm. It’s not really hard to see proof of that these days. While the field of artificial intelligence is nothing new, it has taken a more mainstream character of late, invading mainstream media and showing up in more and more consumer products. And we’re not simply talking about the likes of Siri here. From self-driving cars to chatbots that will keep you entertained and informed, almost everything has one form of machine learning or natural language processing or another. Products, both hardware and software, are getting smarter. Sometimes even smarter than us. And that’s OK, because that is exactly what Google Assistant was built to do. Your own personal Google When was the last time you researched for a topic without using the Internet, by going to a library or diving into Encyclopedias? While it’s certainly possible, chances are your very first recourse for searching for information would be Google or, at least, some search engine. That is how ingrained the idea and behavior has become that it almost feels like second nature. Googling is actually accepted as a formal word today. And the company behind the name is taking advantage of that to make it the main, though not yet the only, way you’ll interact with computers. The idea of voice-controlled, or at least chat-controlled, computers goes as far back as science fiction came into existence, perhaps best embodied by Star Trek’s iconic computer system. In many ways, we’re still a good few years, maybe even decades, from realizing that dream, but Google believes it has already made significant strides forward. At least in the on-stage demo, Google Assistant did seem to be as responsive as a human conversation partner. But Google Assistant isn’t meant to simply be a voiced version of Google Search. That wouldn’t be ambitious enough. Instead, Google’s vision for the AI assistant includes, just like Search, learning about the user’s habits and preferences over time, adjusting its answers to those factors. Google Assistant will cover anything and everything you ask it, with each response carefully chosen to reflect the particular user, harvesting information from the Internet and local storage. It’s like having a search engine tailor-fit for you, and one that really doesn’t matter what you’re running it on. Neither here (Android) nor there (Chrome) When Sundar Pichai laid out the foundations of Google Assistant’s brain, there was no mention of any sort of operating system. In fact, there was really nothing really there that indicated any deep ties to a particular OS. Or to be even more specific, none of those things happen on the device directly, though it’s certainly possible to offload some of it locally. Knowledge Graph, Natural Language Processing, Translation, Voice Recognition, Image Recognition, all of these mostly take place on Google’s servers, not on the smartphone or laptop. In short, Google Assistant is practically OS agnostic. That it is coming first to an Android-based smartphone and home hub is perhaps a simple matter of logistics. It would be easier to use and get it into people’s hands if it were in a fashionable device like the Pixel or a Google Home. There is nothing, however, that ties it down to Android, at least not from the bird’s eye view of its functionality. Sure, Google Assistant will eventually need to hook into operating system features to work, like accessing the mic or getting permission to browse through photos. Those, however, can easily be provided by abstraction layers that would make Google Assistant work even on Chrome OS. And maybe, in the future, it will. Or maybe, in the future, it wouldn’t even matter. It might be a bit of a conspiracy theory, but Google’s attitude about the Google Pixel is strangely Android-agnostic at the very least. To an extent, it is almost downplaying Android’s role in selling the Google Pixel. Whereas other OEMs would even boast about their smartphone running the latest Android version, Google’s landing page for the Pixel barely makes a mention of it. It may also simply be a new marketing strategy, but coming from Android’s own maker and as the first “Made by Google” smartphone, that’s almost telling. It’s almost as if, at least for the Google Pixel and Google Assistant, Google wants to make the OS, Android in this case, invisible. As it should be In theory, that is actually how operating systems, even the things we call the “desktop” should be. They should be completely invisible to the user, getting out of the way and letting the user do his or her task as seamlessly as possible. In reality, that is never the case. Whole marketing efforts have been created around operating systems. Lines have been drawn and loyalties tested. The OS, especially in mobile, is as critical as the device itself. It wouldn’t be an understatement to say that some people are even willing to put up with a device, despite criticism, because of unwillingness to jump to a different OS. The OS, in short, defines the user experience. To that end, the Google Assistant obliterates that convention. Interacting with a computer, in this case in the form of a smartphone, happens through voice or typing. results are shown inside the chat, with an option to jump to a specific app if needed. That said, there might come a time when you won’t even have to. Everything you need to do or want to know, Google Assistant will tell you. HB4116 HB4116 HB4116 HB4116 HB4116 And in many cases, at least in Google’s world, it won’t matter what’s running underneath. Just as the Web works, or at least should work, regardless of OS, so would Google Assistant. It doesn’t even need a screen, as Google Home proves. It is, in other words, the perfect, invisible OS. Not going anywhere (for now) Of course, that’s still just the dream, and we might be years, even a decade, away from Google’s dream world, as fantastic or horrifying that may be. There will only be so much you can do with a virtual assistant, even one that will be as advanced as Google Assistant version 10.0 or whatnot. There will be tasks that simply can’t be done through voice or simple queries alone. You can’t, for example, edit a photo that way, much less create a video. You may be able to dictate a word document, but you certainly can’t a professional-looking slideshow. In those cases, the OS, the desktop, the apps, the chrome, all of those will impose themselves on the user’s consciousness. But that’s OK. Those are practically focused and highly specific tasks that might not fall within the majority of computing use cases. Sounds familiar? That’s pretty much the same arguments being thrown around in the never-ending “The PC is dead” debates. Substitute “Google Assistant” for “mobile device” and “OS” for “PC” and you pretty much have the same line of reasoning. Although there are definitely exceptions, especially with thins like Microsoft’s Continuum, most people use their smartphones for browsing the web, chatting,firing off emails, interacting on social media, playing videos and music, playing games, and, of course, searching. Most of those cases can be started off, or even completely done, in Google Assistant. Need to send a message or email? Ask the Assistant to do it. Need to know the open hours for the new Chinese restaurant down the block? Why bother opening a web browser when you can just ask? Wrap-up Of course, operating systems as we know them, like Android, Chrome, iOS, and the like, aren’t going anywhere. At least not yet. It will be years before Google Assistant even becomes the very smart personal assistant Google wants it to be. And it’s going to take time before it even becomes available to a wider public. Exclusively available only on the Pixel and Home, the Google Assistant isn’t going to be replacing either Android or Chrome any time soon. And it’s not like Google will suddenly drop Android or Chrome when that happens. They’ll still be running things behind the scenes, but that wouldn’t matter to the user anymore. Sure, there will be apps, which could probably be Android apps on either platform (hence Android apps on Chrome), but those will simply be at the service of the AI. Google’s “AI first” battlecry isn’t simply a sign of its focus on this “new age” of computing. It also hints at what it thinks will be the user’s first or primary interaction with a computing device. In short, you interact with the AI first, apps second, and OS last. That is how Google envisions the future of computing, and it’s no small coincidence that its technologies, services, and perhaps even ads, are at the center of it all.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Chatting with Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer about Pixel, Android OEMs, and more The man in charge of Google's software talks Pixel, Nexus, China, and more. by Ron Amadeo - Oct 7, 2016 11:30 am UTC Login to bookmark 87 Ron Amadeo/Google There were big changes announced at Google this week as the company's "Google Hardware" team came out of hiding and announced a slew of products. The star of the show was definitely the Google Pixel, Google's new pair of smartphones that the company is saying it designed while using HTC as a manufacturer. The advent of Pixel phones means Google is an Android OEM again, harkening back to the days when it owned Motorola. This time, though, the company is serious about hardware and software integration. Android, however, is the world's most popular operating system because of OEM partners like Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and LG. And if Google wants Android to continue to deliver Google services to billions of people, it will still need all those partners. Google once again has a delicate balancing act to pull off. The company must do its best to deliver a Google-y Android phone while not stealing the thunder from other OEMs or putting them at a serious competitive disadvantage. To get to the bottom of how this new Google setup works, we sat down with Hiroshi Lockheimer, SVP of Android, Chrome OS, and Google Play. Lockheimer is basically the king of "platforms" (software-side of things) at Google, while former Motorola CEO Rick Osterloh now runs the hardware team. Like the old setup when Google owned Motorola, the two groups will be kept somewhat separate. The return of "The Firewall" Ars: So who is responsible for what now? You only run software? Lockheimer: We were talking before that this is the year, in some ways, that Google has become an OEM. That's Rick [Osterloh's] team. My team is responsible for "Platforms"—that's Android, Chrome OS, and Google Play. Our job is to work with various partners, whether that's Samsung, LG, or now, Rick's team. He's a partner. It's kind of separated that way. So did OEMs get a heads up that this was happening? Do you know how they feel about Google launching its own line of phones? They get it, since the first phones launched in 2008, all OEMs knew there would be multiple OEMs. I work very closely with Samsung, but they know that I meet with LG, and LG knows that I meet with Samsung. There's a long list of OEMs that I meet with, and today we added one more to the list. That's how I think of it, and that's how the OEMs think of it as well. To answer your question directly, I did meet with a number of our partners and give them an update, and they were just "OK, business as usual." Everyone's focused on competing with each other and that's just 'The Android Way.' Is the "Motorola firewall" back? Would you compare the Pixel situation to the Microsoft Surface? The situations, obviously, are different, but we do have a firewall between [the Google Hardware team] and my team, just like we do with everyone else. I think this analogy would make the most sense: Samsung shares a lot of confidential information with us about their roadmaps, LG shares a lot of confidential information with us about their roadmaps. For the past eight years it's been like that, and there's never been a problem. Later Lockheimer mentioned he feels the Pixel phones are additive to the Android ecosystem and shouldn't steal the thunder from OEMs: Part of the philosophy of Android has been, first of all it's open source. The reason why it's open source is we thought manufacturers would want to differentiate and put their own twist on their devices. I think that's largely responsible for the scale that we've been able to achieve with Android. We have over 400 OEMs worldwide building various different devices. Google being able to have its own take on that, as represented through these Pixel phones, is a really good thing, certainly for Google and Google fans. But it doesn't take away anything from stuff that has existed. For instance, Samsung and the innovation put into their phones will continue. It just feels like a purely additive thing to an already thriving ecosystem. Enlarge How do Android versions get made without Nexus developer hardware? Google has stated it has "no plans" for future Nexus devices, which has saddened fans of the typically value-oriented brand. Nexus isn't just about creating a product for consumers, though, it was used as a development platform for Android. Dave Burke, Android's Head of Engineering, addressed rumors of the Nexus program's demise in 2014, saying that the Nexus line was critical to developing an OS. "I think of my team, and there's two outputs: there's the open source code we make available and everyone uses, and then there's Nexus devices, and there's no way I could do open source code without a Nexus device." Burke said back then. "You just can't get all the bugs, you can't actually experience it, you've got to live and breathe it day-in and day-out... So the idea of a Nexus device will never go away, can't ever go away... So I think Nexus continues to be very important for Android." When Android and Motorola existed under the Google umbrella, they were "firewalled" off from each other, but the Android team still had the Nexus program for development hardware. Now that there is a "firewall" between the Google hardware and software divisions, doesn't that mean Google loses the development model it used for the last several years? In this case, the "firewall" has a few ports open. We'll obviously use the Pixel devices [to develop Android]. We'll use old Nexus devices as well. Going forward, we've also been working with many partners as they develop their hardware, we make sure our software works on those as well. We've been sharing early access of the operating system way early. For instance, with [Android 7.0] I think it started in March. So we've been working with partners in many ways beyond Nexus, deeper than ever before, so all that will continue. At least for the first phase of this hardware/software relationship, it really seems like Android 7.1 was developed alongside the Pixel phones. Almost every new Android 7.1 API has a corresponding feature built around it in the Pixel phone's hardware and software. The Pixel launcher has round icons, and a special round icon declaration was added to Android 7.1. Android 7.1 has support for fingerprint gestures, and a f.lux-style "Night Light" mode, and the Pixel is the first to take advantage of them.

Tammy McIvor thought she had got away with the theft from a branch of Savers, the discount chain, in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire. But she was caught in the act when an IT worker stumbled across images online of the 30-year-old making her escape with the shoplifted items. The series of pictures show McIvor running away as a member of staff gave chase from the discount store Credit: Google Street View She was pictured by the camera, which had been taking shots in the street, emerging from the store with her haul in a Sports Direct carrier bag. McIvor is shown running away as a member of staff gave chase. Store bosses were unable to identify McIvor, who has a string of previous convictions, from the stills. But, while her face had been blurred out by Google, Cleveland Police identified McIvor from her distinctive white outfit, which she was wearing when she was arrested. A third image clearly shows the store member running after Tammy McIvor, far left Credit: Google Street View Peter Darby, an IT worker, stumbled across the images of McIvor fleeing the store while he killing time online. The 34-year-old said: “I'm an ex-Teesside University student so I thought I would see my old stomping ground, and as soon as I spotted it I thought 'that seemed a bit strange'. “I moved further down the street and you could see a bloke pursuing her. By the end she was going full speed. "You could tell as soon as you looked at the pictures that something was up as she came out of there very angrily. “She was running around with the Sports Direct bag and it was obvious she was up to no good.” Tammy McIvor has previously been told by a judge to keep away from the 'undesirable influences' that led her into drugs and crime Credit: Facebook The images were filmed as McIvor, who has a string of previous convictions, targeted the store at around 2.45pm on June 19. She appeared before Teesside magistrates, where she was handed a year-long community order, which has a drug rehabilitation requirement, after pleading guilty to theft. The court heard McIvor, of Middlesbrough, has a long history of offending and drug abuse.  It is unbelievable technology and I’ve found a lot of funny things on there, but this is up there with the bestPeter Darby, IT worker who spotted theft on Street View In 2013, she was jailed after burgling two properties in one night, took drugs into prison and used someone else’s name to get out of trouble. The judge at the time told McIvor she should keep away from the “undesirable influences” that led her into drugs and crime. But, with her long criminal record, he said he had no alternative to jailing her for her crime spree. A court heard how McIvor, then 26, had been a heroin addict from the age of 16. After the case, a friend of McIvor, said: "She's harmless but she gets into trouble for shoplifting quite a bit. "A lot of the shops in Middlesbrough and Stockton already know her and look out for her, but she's never been caught like this before. " Google's camera-equipped cars, designed to build up an efficient map of the world's urban and rural areas, allow 360-degree pictures to be taken and searched by anyone around the world. Funny Google Street View images It has been blurring out the faces of people captured on camera to protect their identity since 2008. Mr Darby, of Leyland, Lancashire, added: “It is unbelievable technology and I’ve found a lot of funny things on there, but this is up there with the best. "It was like an action scene from a cop show. I followed it right along the street but obviously couldn't tell whether she got away or not.  "It was bad luck on her part to be running away just as the Google camera was passing."

Jennifer Slegg pointed out to Rand that is and was not the case but Rand does not believe it. Here is that conversation with Rand and Jenn: @jenstar I never believed them on that. Too many examples of Penguin issues lifted post reconsideration+update. Granted, hard to know @Moz— Rand Fishkin (@randfish) October 7, 2016 I should point out that many many SEOs confuse link manual actions with Penguin and many cases there is an overlap of sites with Penguin issues that also have manual actions. But Google said before, Penguin penalties don't get manual actions notices. Google also said time and time again that algorithms can never be reversed by submitting a reconsideration request. I asked Gary Illyes from Google this morning and he said, never ever did a reconsideration request reverse a Penguin or algorithmic penalty: @rustybrick @JohnMu @schachin @randfish @jenstar @Moz absolutely not. Never did and it doesn't now— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 7, 2016 But some still may not believe him, I do. Back in 2013, Google moved the reconsideration request system to the manual action viewer because they couldn't reverse algorithmic penalties with this tool. So they got too many requests for things they could not do anything directly about. Google does know how to look up algorithmic issues but has chosen not to provide what I call an automated action viewer. That being said - again, Google said the reconsideration request doesn't help remove Penguin, Panda or other algorithmic issues for your site. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Jerry B. 10/07/2016 03:20 pm Since 2013, you can't even use the reconsideration request form unless there is a manual action notice. There were no notices for Penguin. WTF is Rand thinking? It isn't 2012 still, is it? Adam Heaton 10/07/2016 04:28 pm Always makes me happy seeing SEO "experts" being told they are wrong. guest 10/07/2016 05:47 pm it is useless question. manual action is rare but when it happen then you can easily rectify it by accessing your website. guest 10/07/2016 05:56 pm i do not think that any algorithm react upon manual action. it do not effect ranking in any way. Patti Paz 10/08/2016 11:59 am Have you ever worked with a website that had been hit with a manual penalty?? IF you are the owner or manager of a website, you probably don't think it is/was a rare occasion, and DEFINITELY don't think it is 'easily rectify' (bad grammar). blog comments powered by Disqus The pulse of the search community Subscribe Subscribe options ADVERTISERS Search buzz Video 11/11/2016 08:39 am Subscribe More videos Video Details Browse by: Browse by Date Find by Category Discover by Author Scan Most Recent See Comments View Tag Cloud SEM FORUM THREADS WebmasterWorld Forums Best Practices for Indexable Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) Facebook Messenger 1.3 Now Allows Sponsored Messages Digital Point Forums How long does google take to update meta tags and do your rankings go down after?

Gary Illyes from Google said this morning on Twitter that the Penguin 4.0 roll out that started and the recovery of Penguin 3.0 stage that started last Wednesday is just about done rolling out. He said it is in the "final stage" and "would take a few more days." Once this stage is done, "then it won't be noticeable anymore" he added, saying "it's working" and that is it. @akuchaaaan007 the final stage that you're seeing now would take a few more days, then it won't be noticeable anymore it's working— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 7, 2016 He also added the jumps and changes people are seeing now are just the normal fluctuations that you'd see, as it is rolling out to the datacenters and depending on which data center you hit, you might see Penguin 3.0 vs Penguin 4.0 results. @akuchaaaan007 no, that's just how it works. Different datacenters get it at different times— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 7, 2016 John also talked about this in the morning hangout on YouTube at the 59:25 minute mark. He said: It could be a matter of the datacenters and where the data is at the moment. It might be something you are seeing there, especially if you are seeing that type of fluctuations. And usually that means it takes a bit of time to kind of settle down. The other aspect that might be happening there is that maybe they are from the Penguin algorithm itself, it has kind of been loosened up and it is ranking a lot better. But it could mean the other algorithms kind of have to adapt a little bit and shuffle things and understand the new status of the web site or the new status of those kind of search results and see how that should settle down. So sometimes you’d see this immediate jump and some point and then shuffles backs into a more steady state. And that is not necessarily something from our Penguin side but from our various algorithms, that they interpret. So if you are seeing improvements, hold on for a few more days until it settles down and I am so happy for those of you who are ranking so much better now!

Do you thing the last stage is not rolling out ? penguin 3.0 is still alive ? thanks Richard 10/07/2016 11:54 am Typo in the first sentence: espesially => especially Not that I'm pedantic or anything... Jerry B's special friend 10/07/2016 11:54 am But according to all the reports, all the crap links they've accumulated in the last two years should now be getting ignored and as a result their rankings should drop. However that doesn't seem to be happening. Barry Schwartz 10/07/2016 11:55 am thank you Charlie B 10/07/2016 11:57 am Good news! We are all free from Penguin. Bad News ! Other quality algos are now surprising sites that were previously hit by Penguin:-( Jerry B's special friend 10/07/2016 11:57 am Any reports on pre-P4 link spammers getting demoted, as their last two years worth of dodgy link building starts getting ignored? Barry Schwartz 10/07/2016 11:58 am I’ll have something on that next week :) Jerry B's special friend 10/07/2016 12:05 pm Great, look forward to reading about that one Steve Bain 10/07/2016 01:34 pm Does anyone else find his constant over use of "kind of" irritating?

Now we KNOW you work for Google or the NSA. Boris 10/07/2016 02:15 pm That is true only if those crap links were giving those sites a ranking boost. They were probably already ignored. What is happening is that sites that had spam links but did not trigger Penguin are now dropping some because those links are now without value. Looks like penguin may now be more precise. Jerry B's special friend 10/07/2016 02:47 pm Well, yes that's a given so didn't bother pointing that out. In my vertical I know a few page one's have tons of dodgy links, but none have dropped even a little bit yet. We'll see.. looking forward to Barry's post on the subject next week. Jerry B's special friend 10/07/2016 02:49 pm Ouch Jer! bit disproportionate unless there's a bit of 'history' I'm unaware of.. hmmm? Anon User 10/07/2016 02:51 pm I thought that would be right up your street Jerry what with the gimp suite and all. Jerry B. 10/07/2016 02:54 pm Everyone has a history. Stevie-boy's history includes taking completely unprovoked, vulgar pot-shots at me which often included accusations of sucking c***. Must have been projecting. Bob 10/07/2016 03:02 pm Kind of. Anon User 10/07/2016 03:07 pm Jerry the victim ... LOL Boris 10/07/2016 03:12 pm I think sites like you describe did not drop because those spam links were already ignored. Since those links were without value good or bad, the sites were ranking good before Penguin 4 regardless of them. I agree that it does not look like many sites have dropped. But if many have risen, the same number must have dropped to some degree. Ben Guest 10/07/2016 03:48 pm What if you receive a client in October 2014, and everything was already cleaned up by the last SEO? How would you know they were Penguinized? Ben Guest 10/07/2016 03:49 pm P.S. You also have no data to compare. Jill veering 10/07/2016 04:01 pm My site was recovering now it looks like Google has rolled the update back. U.K. Based site. Site started to recover early September, then is did a lot dancing now it's going down. Anyone else noticed this? whatsheorderfishfilet 10/07/2016 04:16 pm You don't have access to any stats? It'd take about 5 minutes to tell after looking at their stats. Nick Ker 10/07/2016 04:23 pm If you don't have Google Analytics data going back far enough, try FEInternational's penalty checker https://feinternational.com/website-penalty-indicator/ which uses SEMRush data to estimate traffic. If you mean it was Penguinized after October 2014, you might be out of luck. Ben Guest 10/07/2016 04:34 pm No. It was a hostage situation, and we didn't even get the dang database for their wordpress site since we had to move from the "other guys" hosting. Ben Guest 10/07/2016 04:36 pm Awesome! Thank you. The thing is, nothing would've triggered us to even look. We checked the linking profile, and it was clean. And it looks like the client did take a dip on October 2014. Wonder if the "other guys" went, and cleaned everything up before we got our hands on it. Maybe that's why they didn't give us anything. Not even the DB for their WP site. smh Ben Guest 10/07/2016 04:41 pm LOL, and now that I'm looking at this, looks like the whole zoo affected this domain. Yes1 10/07/2016 05:07 pm Yes. Same here. Steve Bain 10/07/2016 05:56 pm Hehehe, fair play, you've got me on this one - although I hasten to add that my site isn't about ladyboys as such and I don't partake. My site's about Thai girl dating but you can't cover that niche (can barely mention it) without covering the transgender thing. Luckily, I've got broad shoulders and will take this in the jovial spirit with which it isn't intended... :) Lola, L-O-L-A, Lola 10/07/2016 06:09 pm Broad shoulders, like a visible Adam's apple, is one way to tell if she's really a he. Creep! 10/07/2016 06:17 pm As if dehumanizing women is somehow classier than selling ladyboy ebooks. Steve Bain 10/07/2016 06:19 pm I don't sell eBooks or dehumanize women - have you been chuffing on wood-glue or something? Creep! 10/07/2016 06:30 pm You treat "Thai girls" as if your readers are picking out a pet. I saw the ebook when I followed the link you said was to your site at the end of the article. please 10/07/2016 06:38 pm So people... are we now saying if my site is still ranking well and has not been hit at all that I am now free to quit my job as the risk of google destroying my site overnight has gone ? ( a fear ive had since the first penguin ) Jerry B. 10/07/2016 06:40 pm Yeah... your weak jab at me this morning was sooo jovial. Now that I think about it, every comment you have made toward me was nothing but bitterness. At least most people who get all upset with me have some kind of point to make. Not you, though - just insults. I couldn't care less what you do with your spare time or what your preferences are. When I found your sites, I thought it was very ironic that you are an authority on having to go halfway around the world for romance. Remember how you said I must not have a girlfriend or some juvenile nonsense like that? You were just projecting, I suppose. Recovering keyword spammer 10/07/2016 06:40 pm Does seem like we can all sleep slightly easier now, I'm waiting until this baby's fully rolled before i relax a bit though Jerry B. 10/07/2016 06:41 pm If Google is now your main source of income and is not your employer, don't quit your job. Recovering keyword spammer 10/07/2016 06:44 pm Lighten up dude, there are millions of sites all over the world that survive through organic traffic. When has there ever been any 'certainty' about anything? NOTHING is guaranteed Steve Bain 10/07/2016 06:46 pm I hear the same tired old nonsense that you've written here time and again; the truth is very different but this is not the place... And by the way, posting endless google-can-do-no-wrong garbage is provocative. Jerry B. 10/07/2016 06:51 pm I can guarantee that people made the mistake of relying on Google as an income and suffered when Penguin hit, and spent the last few years crying about it. Don't say nobody warned you. Jerry B. 10/07/2016 06:55 pm Show just one time where I said Google can do no wrong. Recovering keyword spammer 10/07/2016 06:58 pm Jerry mate, I hear you and in a perfect world what you're saying would all be lovely. As I'm sure you know though, the real world can be a very different place. Jerry B. 10/07/2016 07:01 pm Yep. The real world is full of people who make bad choices like relying on a third party as their whole business model without any sort of partnership agreement, then want to blame that party when it goes awry. Tian-Mian ✓ 10/07/2016 07:01 pm Today in New York I see mostly post-penguin 4 search results. Couldn't be happier. Anon User 10/07/2016 07:10 pm Jerry lives in his man cave wearing his gimp suit. He has little experience of the real world. I have been penguined, pandered, florida...erd... etc etc ... been at this nearly 20 years and still make more money in a day than Jerry prob earns in a year. All things are relative .... Recovering keyword spammer 10/07/2016 07:11 pm You're too black and white. There are many different situations out there. Jerry B. 10/07/2016 07:15 pm Of course there are. Please explain in what situation it would be a good idea for organic Google traffic to be one's sole source of income? Even the cleanest spam-free site could become a ghost town at the whim of Google. Always have a backup plan and multiple sources of revenue. Recovering keyword spammer 10/07/2016 07:16 pm Who said anything about not having a back up plan? In the meantime, enjoy the ride as long as you can. Jerry B. 10/07/2016 07:20 pm Um, the person who said they were thinking of quitting their job. Recovering keyword spammer 10/07/2016 07:24 pm Don't know about anywhere else but in the UK about 90% of people could survive about 1 month if they lost their 9-5 McJob. If the worst happens to me (online) I've currently got about 5 years to find something else. I say take the chance. Anon User 10/07/2016 07:27 pm The business you work for could go bankrupt. The sky could fall in. The earth could be hit by a meteor. Aliens could invade. You need to mitigate risk with reality mate. Mr. Charles 10/07/2016 07:32 pm Agree with Tian. Its offically hit here in NYC. Starting to think recovery was slim but seeing big bug changes in the green across the board. So happy, my hair is growing back in. Jerry B. 10/07/2016 07:33 pm Anon, you've been commenting here long enough to know I am talking about all those people who were crying about Google causing them to go under when they were relying on nothing but organic search. Bachinskyites. I know you've been feeling neglected since nobody seems to bother with you anymore, but you can't seriously think someone who loses sleep over their site's organic traffic should start banking on it. whatsheorderfishfilet 10/07/2016 07:35 pm Yeah, Penguin is here. Reality 10/07/2016 09:40 pm What a ridiculous comment. You do realize there are many multi million dollar companies whose main source of income comes from Google. Just because something is your main source of income doesn't mean it's your only source. Would you advise a successful high street shop not to open an online store in the fear that the income from that (via Google) overtakes their other income? Reality 10/07/2016 09:42 pm There was a Panda update in October 2014 as well so may be worth looking at this as well. GoliathMarketing 10/08/2016 12:02 am These jumps are making my rank tracker software very anxious. I so hope it settles down soon for track sakes. Chirag Thumar 10/08/2016 05:02 am Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. last 4 day was bad for Us...bcz keywords not stable...fully fluctuations SH AY KH 10/08/2016 06:57 am @BarrySchwartz i have a question i am seeing some strange activity in SERPS in last two days, there are some fluctuations , some tools tell me i am #4 on the first page some tell me i am not there at all , and i also see a little drop in traffic.... why is this happening? and other question is that will the fluctuations continue as penguin is real time ??? latlon technologies 10/08/2016 07:22 am In recent days they is a huge fluctuations in SERP results, even on the same day. Is Penguin responsible for this fluctuations? dsaasd 10/08/2016 07:23 am have you actually read any of the posts or info here SH AY KH 10/08/2016 07:26 am yes i am reading all updates, but this thing really makes me crazy that google is showing my website in certain parts of USA and for some parts it is not there at all.... Boris 10/08/2016 07:56 am You live in cloud cuckoo land mate. If everyone was as risk averse as you there wouldn't even be an internet. Reality 10/08/2016 09:09 am Maybe the links had already been disavowed so weren't helping the rankings anyway? I'd be surprised if the majority of site owners hadn't made some kind of effort to clean up spammy links in the 2 years between P3 and P4. pierre NI 10/08/2016 10:02 am Yes, just like google said, we will be out of misery soon Jerry B's mom 10/08/2016 12:01 pm Jerry B its time to come home now. Your father is disappointed in you son. Mohn Jueller 10/08/2016 12:06 pm Maybe you need to kind of take some time off the internets before you kind of get sort of upset over kinda trivial kinda things like that. Pedro 10/08/2016 12:59 pm Yes. Do not put all your eggs into that one basket. Pedro 10/08/2016 01:05 pm Everybody here maybe forget how Google put screws to many small businesses who had not social media, paid ads, email list, subscribers to keep money coming in when Google penalized. Every business online should be prepared for when Google stops showing his or her websites. NewWorldDisorder 10/08/2016 02:07 pm Read what Barry wrote about. If you are seeing major fluctuations it is most likely because you are getting results from different data centers - some still have P3 and some have P4. Barry spelled it out really well, so read or re-read his post and view the video too because it specifically answers your question. NewWorldDisorder 10/08/2016 02:09 pm You must have missed the part where Barry wrote: "It could be a matter of the datacenters and where the data is at the moment. It might be something you are seeing there, especially if you are seeing that type of fluctuations. And usually that means it takes a bit of time to kind of settle down. The other aspect that might be happening there is that maybe they are from the Penguin algorithm itself, it has kind of been loosened up and it is ranking a lot better. But it could mean the other algorithms kind of have to adapt a little bit and shuffle things and understand the new status of the web site or the new status of those kind of search results and see how that should settle down. So sometimes you’d see this immediate jump and some point and then shuffles backs into a more steady state. And that is not necessarily something from our Penguin side but from our various algorithms, that they interpret." That's the best answer you are going to get so please don't ask these types of questions when it is clear P4 is not rolled out to all data centers. Watch the video Barry posted because it is informative and answered your question. Jesse Cuba 10/08/2016 06:47 pm This will all be over soon. I think it's going to work out for the better too. http://apexwebfirm.com javadth 10/09/2016 04:19 pm 12/20 of google serp is just for one company all improved after p4 and we still dropping totally disappointment Fader 10/09/2016 10:53 pm Your site is pretty poor quality.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Google Noto is a font with every language in human history Listen | Print By James Walker     Oct 7, 2016 in Technology Google has announced the most ambitious font creation project ever undertaken. In collaboration with foundry Monotype, the company has created a font family that includes every character and language in history, a single unified font for all. Creating Noto for Google from Monotype on Vimeo. Google Noto is a typeface that includes dozens of fonts for different languages and styles. It was released today for free for any kind of usage under the OFL license. As part of the project, you'll find characters ranging from modern English to scripts last used in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Creating Noto has been a monumental effort that's taken the best part of five years of largely secret work. The version of Noto released today covers over 800 languages and includes more than 110,000 characters. Google created Noto out of a desire to build a "no more tofu" font project. "Tofu" refers to the blank boxes displayed on websites and in apps when a device isn't able to display a font character. This occurs when the character can't be found in any installed font, such as when viewing foreign language texts or material that uses historic scripts. Fed up with running into tofu issues while building Android and ChromeOS, operating systems designed to be used by millions of people worldwide, Google started work on Noto out of necessity. The original aim was to build a single cohesive font covering hundreds of languages, ensuring any text displayed in Android and ChromeOS would have a matching character in the system font. Over time, the scope of the project grew as Google expanded the number of languages included and brought in specialists for help with specific scripts. Noto is no longer a font aimed solely at ending the tofu problem on digital devices. Google now views it as a way to preserve the history and culture of rare and endangered languages, keeping them alive through digitisation. The company intends to add every new character introduced into the Unicode standard to Noto. It is working with Monotype, Adobe and volunteer reviewers to make this possible. The help it has received has enabled Google to create a "beautiful and consistent" typeface joining every character currently defined by Unicode. The English alphabet, modern Arabic, ancient Tibetan, contemporary emoji and hundreds more have all been represented in a single typeface, creating the largest font family in history. Every Noto character has a distinct look and feel, linking centuries-old scriptures with emoji introduced earlier this year. "Google Noto is a daunting project in size and scope, and I'm proud of how we've worked hard over the past five years to develop a really good product that solves a problem no one else has taken on before," Bob Jung, director of internationalization at Google said to TechCrunch in a statement. "Our goal for Noto has been to create fonts for our devices, but we're also very interested in keeping information alive. When it comes to some of these lesser used languages, or even the purely academic or dead languages, we think it’s really important to preserve them. Without the digital capability of Noto, it’s much more difficult to preserve that cultural resource." Noto is now available for designers and developers to use in their products. For apps and services that need to be available in regions across the world, Noto could be an important resource to have access to. While not the most exciting or inspiring font, as a functional typeface it excels in its scale and scope. Google's commitment to keep expanding Noto could make it an important record of the evolution of human communication and language over time. You can download Noto from Google's website dedicated to the project. The complete typeface weighs in at 472.6 MB. Individual font faces can be downloaded separately, letting you acquire parts of Noto as required. Google has also uploaded the fonts and tools used in Noto's development to its GitHub repository, letting other font creators see how it was built.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Monday, November 14, 2016 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 7184 63 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

News reports said the boy from the eastern city of Torrevieja ran up the Google AdWords bill over two months. His mother, Inma Quesada, told the El Pais newspaper that her son, Jose Javier, said he wanted to become a “famous youtuber” but did not realize what he was doing.Instead of AdSense he was using AdWords and the bill was racking up with great speed. ” We have analyzed this case and we haven’t received payment from this particular user. We will proceed to cancel the user’s pending AdWords balance. Many online services, including Google AdWords, have age restrictions policies in place. We know how important it is to keep the family environment safe on the Internet. That’s why parents have our Safety Center available.” The story came to light when the bank notified his parents that Google was looking to charge the amount to the boy’s account. Google confirmed Wednesday that it studied the case and had cancelled the bill.   Share this: Twitter Facebook Google Like this: Like Loading...

Opinion 41 0 0 October 6, 2016 People Are Googling ‘What Does Trump Pence Mean’: Why Are There So Many Uninformed Voters? Amanda Katherine The following article is entirely the opinion of Amanda Katherine and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr. We are one month and two days from Election Day 2016 on November 8, and one of the top Google searches for today is “What does trump pence mean?” Why are there still so many uninformed voters this late in the game? <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJPxtcx4dyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> In case you were unaware, Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president in the 2016 election this November. Mike Pence will be running alongside Trump for vice president. Hence, Trump and Pence for president 2016. [Image by Angelo Merendino/Getty Images] To see the official campaign site of the Republican nominee in 2016 for U.S. president, check out Donald Trump’s website. Today, October 6, Google search queries for “What does Trump Pence mean” went up 3,4000 percent, the search “Trump Pence meaning” went up 1,700 percent, and “What is Trump Pence” went up 1,350 percent. The majority of the searches came from the United States, Canada, and Australia. It may be a cause for concern that citizens in our country are still seemingly uninformed about the presidential candidates’ initiatives for the country, let alone who the nominee’s vice-president candidate is. On Jimmy Kimmel Live! this week, Jimmy went out onto the streets and was surprised to find out how many American citizens thought that there was a “First Lady Debate.” “Now obviously, there was no First Lady debate, although it would be pretty great if there was. There’s never been a First Lady debate and Bill Clinton is not a lady.” While this was done for a comedic purpose, it is pretty scary how little our citizens know about politics. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vG8lVhyWPmI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Some people are saying, “Do not vote, unless you’re informed.” However, if all of these people are uninformed, there is a pretty good chance a large percentage of them will be voting. People have a responsibility as citizens of this country to inform themselves about the candidates and issues on the ballot well before election day. Recently, an opinion piece was published in the Wall Street Journal by Dorothy Rabinowitz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the newspaper, urging people, especially uninformed voters, to vote for Hillary Clinton. The piece was titled “Hillary-Hated Derangement Syndrome.” “Her election alone is what stands between the American nation and the reign of the most unstable, proudly uninformed, psychologically unfit president ever to enter the White House.” The journalist attacks Trump and his supporters. “They are aware of his casual disregard for truth, his self-obsession, his ignorance, his ingrained vindictiveness.” Hillary Clinton is struggling to win over the millennial vote. Clinton is looking to former Vice President Al Gore to help her energize the youth vote on the issue of climate change. Clinton also wants Gore to reinforce the lasting consequences of voting for a third party candidate, given his experience back in 2000.

Going Out Pubs and Bars Night Tube: London’s best Jubilee line bars Frankie McCoy picks the best late-night drinking spots for the celebrating the Jubilee running all night Frankie McCoy Friday 7 October 2016 10:12 BST Late night fuel: a Dandelyan cocktail The Jubilee line night Tube starts tonight, and that means it’s your duty to stay out until dawn. Here are the best late-night silver-line spots. Aqua Shard Stare yourself dizzy at the bright lights of London from the 31st floor of the Shard, dine on decadent venison tartare and then be frugal and pop on the Tube at London Bridge. Info: 31 St Thomas Street, SE1, aquashard.co.uk The Blue Anchor An old-school pub near Bermondsey station with live music until 1.30am on Fridays and Saturdays, proudly serving real ale, sausages and chips. Info: 251 Southwark Park Road, SE16, blueanchorsouthwark.co.uk Sexy Fish If the sushi here’s good enough for David Beckham, it’ll do for you in the wee hours alongside a few Jaipur Juleps for the road before you call it a night at Green Park Tube. Info: Berkeley Square, W1, sexyfish.com Best pubs, bars and party spots on the Night Tube 36 show all Best pubs, bars and party spots on the Night Tube 1/36 The Drapers Arms 44 Barnsbury Street, N1, thedrapersarms.com Named after the cloth-cutters who once inhabited the area, The Drapers Arms is probably the best pub in London right now. This is mainly thanks to Nick Gibson, the wonderful manager/owner, and a stellar wine list, amazing pies, and Sunday roasts that are better than your mum’s. There are also frequent events to support Action Against Hunger — such as the recent Too Many Chefs, where 10 of the capital’s most brilliant cooks, including Neil Rankin and Will Bowlby, cooked an unforgettable 10-course meal — and dangerously good bin-end event Drink the List, where you have access to every bottle in the place. Hic. Victoria Line – North: Highbury and Islington 2/36 Black Axe Mangal 156 Canonbury Road, N1, blackaxemangal.com Barely a minute’s walk from Highbury & Islington lies former St John chef Lee Tiernan’s tiny, graffitied “haute kebab” restaurant. Granted, you won’t be able to hear anything for a week after an evening of hardcore heavy metal — but it’s worth it for the mind-blowing grub on offer. Or rather, on offal: think foie gras or smoked cod’s roe, Mission Chinese-spiced mutton and a lamb offal flatbread that’s like a smoky flavour-packed punch in the mouth. It doesn’t take reservations but Tiernan’s kebabs are worth queuing in rain, hailstones or a hurricane for. Victoria Line – North: Highbury and Islington Adrian Lourie 3/36 Almeida Theatre Almeida Street, N1, almeida.co.uk In the past 35 years, the Almeida has become one of London’s most well-known theatres outside of the West End, thanks to its penchant for new talent alongside marvellous reinterpretations of the classics. Recent productions have included Ben Whishaw in Bakkhai and Ralph Fiennes in Richard III. The next big thing is Anne-Marie Duff in eco drama Oil, before Andrew Scott takes to the stage as Hamlet alongside Juliet Stevenson. Priority tickets for that go on sale on August 30. Victoria Line – North: Highbury and Islington Wikimedia Commons 4/36 Rowans 10 Stroud Green Road, N4, rowans.co.uk Anyone who grew up in north London will have spent multiple birthday parties screaming and slurping slushies while haphazardly flinging bowling balls in this retro tenpin alley. Now it’s time to return as an adult, to, well, scream and slurp slushies while haphazardly flinging bowling balls. Except this time you can drink alcohol and keep tossing balls until 2am to the lively tunes of one of the venue’s DJs. Victoria Line – North: Finsbury Park 5/36 Yard Sale Pizza 54 Blackstock Road, N4, yardsalepizza.com Pizza aficionados will already be well versed in the joys of a Yard Sale pizza — dough master Nick Buckland and his team’s original site in Hackney was a pilgrimage site for melted mozzarella lovers. Now they’ve brought their massive 18-inch sourdough pizzas to the Victoria line. Sausage fans should head straight for the Holy Pepperoni: Cobble Lane pepperoni, Napoli picante and crumbled nduja sausage. Wash it down with a Five Points Ale or four. Victoria Line – North: Finsbury Park 6/36 Park Theatre Clifton Terrace, N4, parktheatre.co.uk This gem of a theatre which only opened in 2013 is a prime spot for seeing a future Ian McKellen, or the work of the next Trevor Nunn, for a fraction of the price. Book tickets now for The Burnt Part Boys, a musical about the miners. Or just come for the café, which has great cakes and is dog-friendly to boot. Victoria Line – North: Finsbury Park 7/36 Eat 17 28 Orford Road, E17, eat17.co.uk What started as a community-minded grocery has expanded into a pilgrimage spot for food lovers, partly thanks to the superlative bacon jam made there. Yep, bacon jam: a sticky, sweet, smoky, piggy spread that makes pretty much any sandwich in the world into a Michelin-starred experience. There’s also a cracking on-site restaurant that bakes its own bread, uses impeccably sourced ingredients, and serves such spectacular snacks as chorizo jam and mascarpone crostini, and jalapeno poppers. Victoria Line – North: Walthamstow 8/36 Wildcard Brewery Ravenswood Industrial Estate, E17, wildcardbrewery.co.uk Granted, the bleak patch of wasteland that is the Ravenswood Industrial Estate doesn’t look like the kind of place you want to hang around after dark. But you will if you’re into really good craft beer and late-night DJ sets from people you’ve actually heard of (Tame Impala’s Jay Watson recently played). Start with a Brew Your Own session (bacon sarnies included) then neck a pint or three of Wild Card’s marvellous caramelly Ace of Spades porter on the rickety outside picnic tables before the music starts. By the time you leave, you’ll wish you lived on an east London industrial estate. Victoria Line – North: Walthamstow Ben Rowe 9/36 The Bell 617 Forest Road, E17, belle17.com A classic real ale pub that’s made for parents, the Bell also happened to win Camra’s east London pub of 2015. That’s got to have something to do with its glorious Sunday roasts, complete with a nut roast that’s not only edible but so tasty, it might be worth skipping the roast chicken for. It can also lay claims to having Walthamstow’s best pub quiz. Victoria Line – North: Walthamstow Google Maps 10/36 Brunswick House 30 Wandsworth Road, SW8, brunswickhouse.co This stunning wreck of a Georgian mansion, originally built for the Duke of Brunswick in 1758, was rescued by salvager Lassco. Now it’s home to one of south London’s best modern British restaurants. It’s run by Jackson Boxer and Andrew Clarke, who turn out phenomenal daily changing dishes such as roast Swaledale veal and chocolate cumin pudding. All the antiques on display are for sale too, so don’t be surprised if you find yourself clutching a fringed Twenties lamp after one too many Hemingway Daiquiris. Victoria Line – South: Vauxhall Matt Writtle 11/36 Pharmacy 2 Newport Street, SE11, pharmacyrestaurant.com Don’t worry if you weren’t there for the original debauchery of Damien Hirst and Mark Hix’s first restaurant, Pharmacy. Now there’s Pharmacy 2, attached to Hirst’s Newport Street gallery, which has just started hosting late-night sessions until 2am every Saturday. Contemplate the floating basket balls in the Jeff Koons Now exhibition until 10pm, then hit restaurant next door for Black Cow vodka cocktails, Hix’s posh curry sauce ’n’ chips and surprise DJ sets. Victoria Line – South: Vauxhall 12/36 Royal Vauxhall Tavern 372 Kennington Lane, SE11, vauxhalltavern.com The RVT truly is a South London institution. The Grade II-listed Victorian music hall has been threatened with closure multiple times, but outrage and fabulous protests from its die-hard LGBT community has always saved it. A wonderfully welcoming atmosphere with spectacular cabaret and drag acts, live music, bingo and a hell of a lot of Britney and Madonna that has, as they put it, been “Serving confirmed bachelors and friends since long before Kylie was born”. Victoria Line – South: Vauxhall Google Maps 13/36 Crown and Anchor 246 Brixton Road, SW9, crownandanchorbrixton.co.uk Perfect for craft beer snobs whose mates refuse to visit another chilly, uncomfortable microbrewery in a car park or railway arch. This cosy pub has armchairs rather than barrels masquerading as seats, as well as a huge range of small-batch London brews — from Gipsy Hill to Northern Monk — and a weekly pub quiz. Victoria Line – South: Stockwell Google Maps 14/36 The Cavendish Arms 128 Hartington Road, SW8, thecavendisharmsstockwell.co.uk Locals know this place as the Cav and rock up to giggle/grimace at the weekly comedy open mic nights while tucking into giant gourmet hot dogs and its famous three-cheese disco fries. At the weekends, it’s open until 1.30am, when there’s also free live music from up to five acts in the ballroom — because what’s a pub without a ballroom? Victoria Line – South: Stockwell 15/36 LOST Theatre 208 Wandsworth Road, SW8, losttheatre.co.uk This tiny theatre might only seat 180, but from small things come massive actors: in its previous Fulham incarnation, it counted Ralph Fiennes and Mackenzie Crook as alumni. Frequent art exhibitions from emerging talent are held in its event space, but the main draw is the bargainous ticket price for offbeat plays from up-and-coming thesps. Grab the last few tickets to drag-centric comedy Do You Have a Secret Crush, or hold out for meta-comedy A Night at 64 Emptiness Lane, which starts its run on September 1. Victoria Line – South: Stockwell James Thacker 16/36 POP Brixton 49 Brixton Station Road, SW9 , popbrixton.org All day, late-night market built from shipping containers. Small businesses selling fashion and homewares are invited to pop up during the day, but in the evening it’s all about the brilliant street food traders, like Indian small plate restaurant Kricket and pizza maestros Made of Dough. Wash down your dinner with some surprising New World wines courtesy of NZ Wine Cellar. POP has just opened its outdoor space, POP Fields as well, where it’s running silent discos and movie screenings: Rocky and 500 Days of Summer are coming up in September. Victoria Line – South: Brixton 17/36 Dogstar 389 Coldharbour Lane, SW9, dogstarbrixton.com Mostly held up by scaffolding and with smeary, curtain-swathed windows, Dogstar might look like the kind of place you’d normally cross the road to avoid. But this so-grotty-it’s-great stalwart of Atlantic Road has stood the test of time for many reasons: set over three floors, it’s huge, and plays hosts to all manner of themed nights. Drinks are super cheap, the on-site pizzas are surprisingly great and there are big TV screens — so good luck getting in if there’s any kind of sporting event occurring. Open till 4am on Friday and Saturday nights, so you practically don’t need the Night Tube anyway. Victoria Line – South: Brixton 18/36 Ritzy Brixton Oval, SW2, picturehouses.com Sure, the Ritzy shows films, but it has so many other cool events on as well, such as weekly yoga, blues nights, and quizzes in its event space Upstairs at the Ritzy. There are also lots of Q&A sessions with actors and film directors, plus a café cum restaurant serving a healthy selection of booze. Just try not to fall asleep during a late movie. Victoria Line – South: Brixton Tim Kerr/Photocall Productions 19/36 Satan's Whiskers 343 Cambridge Heath Road, E2, twitter.com Regularly nabbing one of the top spots in the World’s Best Bars list, Satan’s Whiskers is the kind of cocktail bar you want up your sleeve for when your coolest out-of-town friends come to stay. There’s taxidermy, neon, excellent old-skool hip hop and some seriously good drinks — although don’t expect to walk out unaided after more than two Tuxedo #2s: gin, vermouth, maraschino, bitters and absinthe. Ooft. Central Line – East: Bethnal Green 20/36 The Horn of Plenty 36 Globe Road, E1, thehornofplentypub.co.uk Are you feeling lucky, punk? During the Horn’s happy hour, drinkers must play rock paper scissors with the bartender — you only get your half-price booze if you beat them. There’s a long, long list of Bloody Marys on offer and board games for when you’ve drunk six pints and have a hankering to relive your childhood days as a Boggle champion. Central Line – East: Bethnal Green 21/36 The George Tavern 73 Commercial Road, E1, thegeorgetavern.co.uk Possibly the hippest pub in London, with regular performances by post-punk minimalist two-pieces and more funk and soul than you can shake a pint glass at. But it’s also got history — the George is on the site of a 700-year-old tavern mentioned in the writings of Charles Dickens, Samuel Pepys and Geoffrey Chaucer. Besides, you’d have to be made of stone to not enjoy the regular East End Variety Bunker nights, which promise “singalong tunes, party games, and general camp old nonsense”. Open until 3am at weekends. Central Line – East: Bethnal Green The George Tavern 22/36 Here East Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, E20, hereeast.com There’s nothing like an Olympic venue to make you want to stuff your face with chips and craft beer. Lucky, then, that the Here East development has just opened in the old Olympic Press and Broadcast Centre in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. There’s lots of rentable offices and working spaces, but more importantly, there’s excellent grub on offer in this charming canalside spot. Randy’s Wings serve up some of London’s best chicken wings — good luck not becoming addicted to its Korean-inspired Gangnam wings, sticky and deeply umami-ish — while Mason and Company combines the excellent Five Points Brewery with Italian-American comfort food. Capiche? Central Line – East: Stratford 23/36 Tap East 7 International Square, Westfield Stratford City, E20, tapeast.co.uk Westfield isn’t just clothes shopping and cinema you know — it’s also home to an excellent microbrewery. In the “Great Eastern Market” area of the shopping centre is Tap East, with a huge selection of beer: 100 bottles from around the world, plus 16 on tap from its on-site brewery, such as East End Mild and Johnny Park Bitter. Drink them by the third so you can sample as many as possible. If you’re a vinyl junkie, tweet the bar the albums you’re dying to hear, then rock up to the weekly vinyl night to find out if your Seventies mod-revival choice has made the cut. Central Line – East: Stratford Tap East Blog 24/36 Flamingo Pier CRATE Brewery, 7, The White Building, Queen’s Yard, E9, flamingopier.net What makes a pop-up, booze-soaked party even better? Palm trees and flamingos, obviously. DJ Luke Walker teams up with the excellent CRATE brewery — home to craft beer, pizza, and a lot of vibes — each month to throw mega parties, with a ridiculous amount of booze and choons. They’ve recently moved homes to Mick’s Garage, which means you can refuel after dancing your socks off with Middle Eastern mezze from Berber and Q’s Shuk Shuk alongside all the CRATE beer. Central Line – East: Stratford Ravi Chand 25/36 Leyton Technical 265 High Road, E10, leytontechnical.com No, you haven’t accidentally wandered into a stately home, despite the soaring ceilings, mosaic floors and chandeliers. Because which National Trust joint have you ever known with seven Cask Marque ales on tap, live DJs playing every weekend until 1am and a weekly comedy night called Are You Having a Giraffe? Its vegetarian Wellington on Sundays is an oozy, crispy slab of cheesy goodness. Dogs are allowed. Central Line – East: Leyton 26/36 Luna Lounge 7 Church Lane, E11, lunalounge.info Live music buffs will have already made it out to this haven of all things jazz, acid, funk and well, any other variety of music you care to name. Like an actual monthly Western night — stetsons at the ready. Not only is it open until 1am, it’s also within spitting distance of the Tube for when you tear yourself away from the choons. Central Line – East: Leyton Andy Field 27/36 The Leyton Star 116 High Road, E15, leytonstar.co.uk The Star opened its doors just a month ago, but it has already become a staple in the craft beer drinker’s diet. Make the most of the dying days of summer in the beer garden (there’s a massive golden palm tree!). Plus the quite excellent We Serve Humans are doing the food: that means mental burgers like Mac the Ripper (deep–fried mac ’n’ cheese) and jockey whips: chips fried in beef dripping, topped with truffle. Drool. Central Line – East: Leyton The Leyton Star 28/36 Bush Theatre 7 Uxbridge Road, W12, bushtheatre.co.uk A real incubator for new and emerging talent, this titchy theatre by Shepherd’s Bush market has a reputation for being the first to show plays which go on to open in the West End and on Broadway. The Old Library, its home since 2011, is being refurbished to turn it into a modern space with more rehearsal rooms for amateur thesps and a technical workshop for budding production staff. Fingers crossed it’ll still serve the same amazing coffee and cakes. Central Line – West: Shepherd’s Bush Bush Theatre 29/36 Shikumen Dorsett Hotel, 58 Shepherd’s Bush Green, W12, shikumen.co.uk When made well, xiao long bao, the Chinese soup-filled dumplings, are some of the most delicious morsels on earth. And the examples at this unpromising-looking restaurant just off Shepherd’s Bush Green are superb. They’ve won over critics from Fay Maschler to Giles Coren thanks to their super-delicate skins and umami-ish broth. The restaurant has just launched a rainbow collection of multi-coloured dumplings, including beetroot-coloured Szechuan spicy pork and incredibly decadent black charcoal-dyed lobster truffle. Central Line – West: Shepherd’s Bush Hugh Flouch/Red Wheelbarrow 30/36 Brewdog 15 Goldhawk Road, W12, brewdog.com London’s not short of brilliant craft beer but it was BrewDog which really kicked off our obsession with punchy, hoppy IPAs. Although the pub chain has its detractors, the beer is still excellent, and the Goldhawk Road bar gives you the opportunity to try a dangerous amount. There are 40 different types on tap, from the bar’s classic Punk IPA through to the innocent-sounding but deadly Hello, My Name Is Ingrid, which clocks in 8.2%. There’s a healthy selection of guest beers and some stonking nachos to soak up all that hoppy goodness. Central Line – West: Shepherd’s Bush 31/36 Pergola on the Roof Multi-Storey Car Park, Television Centre, Wood Lane, W12, pergolaontheroof.co.uk London loves a good rooftop party. In W12, everyone’s getting high at the old BBC Television Centre, which has been taken over by a huge array of benches, boules pitches and leaves. There’s also some cracking food from burger legends Patty & Bun and tapas from Salt Yard, plus bathtubs of rose and beer. But get your skates on — you’ve only got until August 29 to get up there and eat yourself silly. Central Line – West: White City 32/36 Albertine 1 Wood Lane, W12, albertinewinebar.co.uk Wine, wine and more wine at this 40-year-old drinking hole. Opened specifically to serve the needs of thirsty BBC employees, particularly those on Newsnight, the quaint bar’s extremely reasonably priced wine selection has kept the place busy despite the Beeb’s exodus from the area. The farinata and sticky aromatic pork belly are delicious but really, you’re here for the plonk. Most are available to take away, although you’ll never recreate this convivial atmosphere at home. Central Line – West: White City 33/36 Bush Hall 310 Uxbridge Road, W12, bushhallmusic.co.uk ince 1904, this huge Edwardian space has been a dance hall, Second World War soup kitchen, bingo hall and rehearsal space for such as The Who, Cliff Richard and Adam Faith. Now it’s primarily a music venue (Ellie Goulding, Adele and Kings of Leon have all played here), although it also serves as a rather lovely event space. And you know that bloke you met in Brixton earlier in this feature? Reader, you can marry him here. Central Line – West: White City 34/36 Vindinista 74 Churchfield Road, W3, vindinista.com Sister to East Acton’s best wine shop, Park + Bridge, this tiny bar serves really interesting wines, including English white and skin-contact. Locals throng in for the regularly changing stock, sniffing and swilling small production grape juice as if they know exactly what they’re talking about. Even if your wine knowledge ends at “light and fruity”, you can focus on the short, high-quality food menu: empanadas sit alongside charcuterie boards and the rather fabulous Vindinista cheese and truffle toastie. Central Line – West: East Acton 35/36 The Aeronaut 264 Acton High Street, W3, aeronaut.pub f you like trapeze with your Trappist beer and somersaults with your cider — and frankly, who doesn’t? — you need to try the Aeronaut. Established in honour of Acton-born aviation pioneer George Lee Temple, the first man to fly a plane upside down, the sort of acrobatics on show are less plane-based and more plain impressive: expect contortionists bending themselves into knots and fire breathers — who said you couldn’t smoke inside pubs any more? Central Line – West: East Acton 36/36 Dragonfly Brewery 183 Acton High Street, W3, twitter.com Watch your beer being brewed right in front of your thirsty eyes at the George — the stills that make its Dragonfly range are beside the giant mermaid figurehead on a plinth that casually sits on the bar. 2 O’Clock Ordinary is exactly the light bitter you need to kick off a session; follow it with one of the mammoth burgers and an unfiltered Early Doors pale ale. The best news? All the in-house brewed beer is £3.50, which makes it among the cheapest in London. Central Line – West: East Acton Hawker House Snaffle Prawnography crab fries and Mother Clucker fried chicken, then sink a few Brit Spritzes in Kamm’s Kitchen. Canada Water station is close enough for stumbling home. Info: Canada Street, SE16, streetfeast.com Dandelyan Bar  You have until 2am to work your way through the World’s Best Cocktail menu — save room for the Vaudeville Venom (it features pisco, vodka and mango). Your carriage awaits at Waterloo.

Pixels bought at Best Buy are the Verizon models, so system updates for those, too, will be managed by Verizon. Combined with the news that Verizon models will have a locked bootloader and come with Verizon crapware, it's pretty clear that Americans among us should really, really opt to buy the Pixel outright from the Google Store. Yes, that means higher upfront costs, but you'll have lower monthly expenses, proper updates, and an unlocked bootloader. Anybody with even an ounce of common sense should avoid Verizon Pixels like the plague.
