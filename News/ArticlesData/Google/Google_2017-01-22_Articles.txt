Office life is better than ever before, but dissatisfaction is rising Mon, Jan 23, 2017, 05:30 Lucy Kellaway Companies are trying hard to make staff happy in their jobs, but it’s not working. Photograph: iStock         The boss of a friend recently gathered all his charges together for a ritual new year pep talk. “Each of you has the right to love your job,” he told them. She thought this was terrific and looked a bit dashed when I pointed out it was both dangerous and unrealistic. No one has the right to love their jobs. Not only that, most people hate them. If you type into Google “my job is –” the search engine predicts the way your sentence is going: “so boring” or “making me suicidal” or “ making me miserable”. If you start “my boss is –”, Google offers: “lazy”, “ is bullying me” or (my favourite) “a cow”. Even more alarming, if you type “my job is stimulating”, it assumes you have made a typo and suggests what you must have meant “not stimulating”. The internet has a way of whipping up bad feeling. Yet in this case, workplace disaffection is real and growing. We are in the middle of what Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor at UCL in London, calls an “epidemic of disengagement”. Most surveys show less than a third of workers care for their jobs, and the long-term trend is getting worse. In the UK, there is some evidence we like our jobs a good deal less than we did in the 1960s. This is most peculiar. I was not in the workforce in the 1960s. But I was in the 1980s, and can confirm things are better than they were back then. When I joined the City, pre-Big Bang, it was stuffed with upper-class men in pinstripes, many of whom were astonishingly dim. Getting criticism to deliver at work Making learning practical for small business owners Wild Geese: For PwC accountant, the way is clear in Fog City Jobs were still for life, so if you landed one you did not like, you were trapped. Promotions took ages, and even then were largely based on Buggins’ turn and who you played golf with. Bullying was so normal no one thought to complain. Office buildings were dingy, dirty and uncomfortable. There was no such thing as ergonomic chairs, and you were likely to get lung cancer from all the passive smoking. ADVERTISEMENT Miserable Now, not only are offices bright and beautiful, we do not even have to go to them if we do not feel like it – we can work at home instead. Bosses have been taught not to shout. There are gyms and free fruit. And if you happen to be a woman, things have improved beyond recognition. In the 1960s you were limited to filing and shorthand, while now (at least in theory) you can run the show. So why are we so miserable? The most common reason is having a bad manager. But this is a puzzle as managers are surely less hopeless now than they were half a century ago. All those MBA degrees, mentoring, coaching and training, none of which existed 50 years ago, cannot have been entirely in vain. Part of our modern disaffection may be due to job hopping. Because we can leave at the drop of a hat, we are less likely to make a go of wherever we are. If everyone is constantly coming and going, no one ever feels secure or has any sense of belonging. But the biggest reason for unhappiness is that we expect too much. Office jobs may have improved, but our expectations have far outstripped them. Better education has not helped. People with university degrees tend to dislike their jobs more than people without them. And so, as more people have degrees, unhappiness rises. As we march up Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, it is harder to enjoy the view from the top. Disaffected Things are made worse by the well-meaning actions of the companies themselves. Faced with a disaffected workforce, they insist it is vital for us to be happy. They trumpet their values. They tell us they are changing the world. They demand we are all not merely engaged, but passionately so. They encourage us to volunteer at good work, all in the name of meaning. The result is not happiness. According to new research from Sussex university, when done crassly this sort of thing makes workers unhappier and more disenchanted than they were before. The corporate obsession with happiness is part of the cause of our unhappiness. When everyone around you is claiming to feel passion or to have found meaning, or when managers say you have a right to love what you do, it is only natural – at the smallest hint of boredom, or after a minor run-in with a manager – to conclude that your job makes you suicidal and your boss is a cow. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Tomas Chamorro Premuzic Google London(GB) United Kingdom Read More Search for mentors can produce stellar results Rejected at work: Should I stay or should I go?

HTC's Android Wear Smartwatch Caught in Live Pictures GO This is the second set of photos showing the wearable device Jan 23, 2017 05:21 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Google debuted 2017 with a couple of Android Wear-related announcements, which suggests the search giant plans to focus on the development of the new ecosystem for wearable devices in the first half of the year. With the launch of Android Wear 2.0 around the corner, many companies announced their support for the new OS with the launch of new smartwatches. Even Google is supposed to launch its own Android Wear 2.0-powered smartwatches, which will be built by LG. We reported about these Google smartwatches last week, as we learned that the Watch Sport and Watch Style would be announced on February 9, at the same time Android Wear 2.0 is set to be officially released. Now, a new set of pictures showing the rumored HTC Halfbeak smartwatch have just been published on Weibo, the Chinese alternative to Facebook. This is the second time we get to see HTC's smartwatch after the gadget leaked online last October. HTC Halfbeak The circular form factor that we already knew from the previous pictures is confirmed once again, along with the two buttons placed on the right side of the smartwatch. According to the latest rumors, HTC Halfbeak should pack a small display with 360 x 360 pixel resolution. The smartwatch is made in collaboration with Under Armor, which is why the logo of the accessory company appears on the back side. The pictures show that the smartwatch is running Android Wear 1.0, but if HTC plans to launch it this year, we can safely assume it will ship with Android Wear 2.0 right out of the box. Unfortunately, it appears that HTC is still assessing the smartwatch market, so it's unclear whether or not the Halfbeak will be made official anytime soon. Our best bet would be an announcement at Mobile World Congress, but HTC fans shouldn't get their hopes too high.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (13 Images) #Android Wear 2.0#HTC Halfbeak#HTC smartwatch#LG Watch Sport#wearable device subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it HTC Halfbeak (13 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news TAG Heuer Connected Defies Report of Smartwatches Being Unpopular, Sales Triple LG Watch Sport and Watch Style Are Google's First Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches Android Wear 2.0 Confirmed to Arrive in Early February HTC’s Halfbeak Smartwatch Running Android Wear Leaks in Photos New LG G6 Leaked Picture Shows Metal Frame, Thin Bezels Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB3216755 Apple in Trouble As More Buyers Get the iPhone 6s Instead of the iPhone 7 LeakedSource Website Goes Dark Shazam Adds Three App Shortcuts for Faster Song Recognition on Android Phones LG Files Patent Applications for Foldable Smartphones Alcatel to Announce Five New Smartphones During MWC 2017 Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast 13 photos    HTC Halfbeak new android apps Brave Browser APK: Updated January 27th, 14:13 GMT Signal APK: Updated January 27th, 14:10 GMT PokeAlert - Notification for Pokemon GO APK: Updated January 27th, 14:08 GMT SmartThings Mobile APK: Updated January 27th, 14:07 GMT Newsroom APK: Updated January 27th, 14:03 GMT United Airlines APK: Updated January 27th, 14:01 GMT Reddit APK: Updated January 27th, 13:56 GMT Reader comments New LG G6 Leaked Picture Shows Metal Frame, Thin Bezels more on: MWC 2017 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Google Rolls Out Instant Tethering Functionality to Pixel and Nexus Devices GO Introduced as part of the new Google Play Services 10.2 Jan 23, 2017 05:01 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Google has silently pushed a new feature to Nexus and Pixel devices that is called Instant Tethering. It's a slightly more advanced implementation of the standard tethering functionality, which is supposed to make the process of setting up connectivity using this feature much easier. The new Instant Tethering feature has been implemented as part of Google Play Services 10.2, so if you own a Nexus or Pixel device and haven't yet updated to this version, then you won't be able to benefit from it. It's also worth noting that some Nexus and Pixel devices that have already been updated to Google Play Services 10.2 don't have the new Instant Tethering feature enabled, but you can check for it by heading to the settings and Google menu. According to AndroidPolice, with the new feature, Nexus and Pixel devices will automatically set up a new tethering connection without having to make any special settings. Nexus 6P It looks like Instant Tethering can connect devices that are associated with a Google account, thus making it easier to stay online when the connection drops. Basically, whenever the connection drops, the phone will ask you whether you want to tether to another device associated with your Google account or not. If your answer is “yes,” then you won't need to make any additional changes, but keep in mind that the feature uses Bluetooth to negotiate the connection, so make sure it's enabled. Instant Tethering also allows users to see the battery level of their other device. Google hasn't yet announced anything related to Instant Tethering, but it looks like the new feature is being pushed to Nexus and Pixel devices that are powered by Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system. Moreover, the Nexus 9 and Pixel C are supported as clients only, which means these devices can connect to compatible phones. The new feature also allows two phones to connect to each other if one of them loses its connection.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Instant Tethering#Android 7.1.1 Nougat#Nexus phone#Pixel XL#tethering phone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Says Fix for Known Audio Issue Is Coming Soon to Pixel Phones Audio Issue on Pixel Phones Is Hardware Related, Google Says Nexus 6P Units Affected by Early Shutdowns Following Android Nougat Update Google Pixel Audio Problem Can Be Fixed by Flashing Custom ROM New LG G6 Leaked Picture Shows Metal Frame, Thin Bezels Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB3216755 Apple in Trouble As More Buyers Get the iPhone 6s Instead of the iPhone 7 LeakedSource Website Goes Dark Shazam Adds Three App Shortcuts for Faster Song Recognition on Android Phones LG Files Patent Applications for Foldable Smartphones Alcatel to Announce Five New Smartphones During MWC 2017 Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast 2 photos    Instant Tethering feature new android apps Brave Browser APK: Updated January 27th, 14:13 GMT Signal APK: Updated January 27th, 14:10 GMT PokeAlert - Notification for Pokemon GO APK: Updated January 27th, 14:08 GMT SmartThings Mobile APK: Updated January 27th, 14:07 GMT Newsroom APK: Updated January 27th, 14:03 GMT United Airlines APK: Updated January 27th, 14:01 GMT Reddit APK: Updated January 27th, 13:56 GMT Reader comments Motorola Files Patent for Iris Scanner, Could Be Featured on Moto Z 2017 more on: Motorola i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Amazon and Google always thrive in the fourth quarter as people get out their wallets for Christmas. Both companies – or in Google’s case, its parent group, Alphabet – are therefore expected to announce booming revenues in their fourth-quarter results over the next fortnight, with Alphabet going first on Thursday and Amazon the following week. But analysts are already looking beyond the simple question of how many cardboard boxes Amazon filled and how many searches Google answered. They’re wondering which company will win the battle to control your home. That battle is being fought by two carafe-sized cylinders from the respective companies. One is Amazon’s Echo, with its voice-operated “personal assistant”, Alexa; the other is Google Home, which responds to the phrase “OK Google”. Both are internet-connected, home-based devices which can be command to do things: give the weather forecast; play music; read out news headlines; update shopping lists; and control “smart” devices in the home such as light bulbs or power points. In theory, if a device can be linked to it, the Echo can control or monitor it, and keep you informed. And simply by saying “Alexa, add sugar to the shopping list”, users can keep up to date on house supplies and even purchase them directly. Amazon is in the lead, having launched the Echo in November 2014, two years before Google Home came out. Though Amazon has not – and does not – release sales figures for any individual item, investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that 11m Echos had been sold by the end of November 2016; other estimates suggest a further 7m have been sold since. About 700,000 were estimated to have been sold in the UK and Germany, the only countries outside the US where it is available. The Morgan Stanley estimate would put an Echo in more than 8% of US households. This is a significant figure, especially compared with the best estimates for Google Home, which put its sales at less than a million since its launch in October 2016. Why should Google care about Amazon? Because voice is seen as the next big field for computer interaction, and the home is a far better environment for voice detection than the great outdoors. Research company Gartner reckons that by 2018, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type, and the technology behind voice interaction is improving all the time. The risk to Google is that at the moment, almost everyone starting a general search at home begins at Google’s home page on a PC or phone. That leads to a results page topped by text adverts – which help generate about 90% of Google’s revenue, and probably more of its profits. But if people begin searching or ordering goods via an Echo, bypassing Google, that ad revenue will fall. And Google has cause to be uncomfortable. The shift from desktop to mobile saw the average number of searches per person fall as people moved to dedicated apps; Google responded by adding more ads to both desktop and search pages, juicing revenues. A shift that cut out the desktop in favour of voice-oriented search, or no search at all, would imperil its lucrative revenue stream. Amazon is copying one feature of Google’s success in smartphones: it is offering methods to connect and control smart devices via the Echo for free, rather as Google’s Android software was offered as a free platform for smartphones. There are signs it is paying off: Wynn hotels in Las Vegas announced in December that it would be adding Echos to all 5,000 rooms, for functions such as playing music and controlling curtains and blinds. That gained some notice, as much as anything because the life cycle of such hotels implies they will be there for a decade or so. Similarly, at January’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), also in Las Vegas, commentators were struck by how many devices incorporated Alexa. And Amazon is even stealing into Google’s territory: some phones sold in the US from China’s Huawei, which uses Android, will incorporate Alexa rather than Google’s Assistant programme. Google’s natural reaction is to have its own voice-driven home system, in Home. But that poses a difficulty, illustrated by the problems it claims to solve. At the device’s launch, one presenter from the company explained how it could speak the answer to questions such as “how do you get wine stains out of a rug?” Most people would pose that question on a PC or mobile, and the results page would offer a series of paid-for ads. On Home, you just get the answer – without ads. What analysts wonder is: how can Home bridge that revenue gap? So far, Google hasn’t explained. Even if it can fend off the Echo, it may not be able to defend its core business. By contrast, the Echo’s benefit to Amazon is much clearer: it can make online shopping (at Amazon) a breeze, play music from Amazon’s paid-for subscription service, and generally act as a passive block on your using rival shopping sites – rather as Google cemented its dominance by being the default search engine on multiple browsers in the mid-2000s. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research suggests that time is running out for Google: “It has to act quickly, as Amazon is on the brink of becoming the industry standard for controlling smart home devices. “At CES, everyone was integrating with Echo, with Google Home and Apple HomeKit barely present.” Indeed, where are Apple and Microsoft, which also have their own voice-driven assistants in the form of Siri and Cortana? Although both can be used in the home – Siri on the iPhone or iPad, and to play content on the Apple TV set-top box, and Cortana on the Xbox games console – neither seems to be intent on the “home assistant” market. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice-president of marketing, seemed to suggest recently that Apple wouldn’t follow Amazon and Google into offering a voice-only device: “Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” He also emphasised the importance of a visual display: “We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.” Even so, there are persistent rumours that Apple has prototyped an Echo-like device in secret but is undecided on whether to release it. The company hasn’t commented. It could be ready to unveil something – or may never do so. Microsoft, meanwhile, is in more homes than the Echo via the Xbox, but isn’t trying to make itself a listening device linked to a shop. So, will we all be burbling away to thin air in a few years, asking how long our commute will take while our smartphones sit unused in the kitchen? Perhaps – though Ken Sena, a senior analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, suggests that home-based voice assistants will never be used as widely as smartphones. According to Sena, they are not such a must-have. Yet, they were a hot Christmas present – and voice interaction is still in its early days, perhaps comparable to the smartphone market in 2005, when BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft dominated. Or, it could be like the smartphone market now, effectively dominated by Google and Apple. But which? Alexa, can you see into the future?

Image Credit: Screenshot Google has integrated part of the Explore feature of Google Maps into its core web search. It recently came to desktop Google Search results after arriving first on mobile devices, where the Explore feature made its debut in 2013 as part of Google Maps. The carousel-style widget appears under the heading “Discover more places” and showcases eight or nine categories of places that are relevant to your search. For example, when I search for “fried chicken,” the new feature in search results display photos and names of restaurants under the categories “Best spots for lunch with kids,” “Chicken and waffles,” “Chicken restaurants,” “American restaurants,” and so on. Clicking on one of these results on desktop takes you to a Google Maps-like interface showing the places in a column on the left and on a big map on the right — from there you can select individual places to see in more detail. But these pages are located at URLs that begin with https://www.google.com/search, as opposed to https://www.google.com/maps. On the mobile web, after tapping one of the categories, you see a stack of cards of places, along with pictures you can swipe through — a stripped-down implementation of Explore in the native Google Maps apps. The feature rolled out to desktop earlier this month, after hitting the mobile web in October, and it’s visible for searches about things pertaining to food and drinks for people using U.S. English as their default language, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. “Google is committed to helping people find the most up-to-date, comprehensive, and useful information, so they can make the best decision on where to go. And we’re always working on new ways to help improve that experience for our users,” the spokesperson wrote. Above: What you see if you click one of the categories surfaced in “Discover more places” from Google Search on desktop. Image Credit: Screenshot Google has taken steps to enhance Explore in Google Maps over the years. In 2015, the Explore portion of the Android app was revamped with a new look and a more granular discovery mechanism, and similar improvements came to Google Maps for iOS in 2016. “Discover more places” typically appears at the bottom of desktop search results and near the bottom on the mobile web; sometimes above it there is other content sourced from Google Maps, such as nearby places plotted on a map and listed immediately below. That Google would show multiple representations of Google Maps content in Search suggests that the company simply wants to figure out what works best. Google might well end up blending the map and list with the option of highlighting collections of places à la the Explore/Discover more places feature — but for now, there is overlap.

It is getting harder for web users to tell the difference between trusted websites and malicious content, according to a developer working on Google Chrome. In a blog post, Google engineer Eric Lawrence said that it helps to think of browsers having a “line of death” between pixels controlled by the browser and those that are under the control of a website and therefore subject to manipulation by a malicious actor. “In web browsers, the browser itself usually fully controls the top of the window, while pixels under the top are under control of the site. I've recently heard this called the line of death,” he said. “If a user trusts pixels above the line of death, the thinking goes, they'll be safe, but if they can be convinced to trust the pixels below the line, they're gonna die.” Lawrence added that this crucial demarcation isn't explicitly pointed out to the user, and worse than that, it's not an absolute. He cited an example where chevrons are used to cross over this line of death so that the browser can show extra information, such as if a connection is secure. Phishers, while not being able to cross this line, can fake something like this that touches the line and most users will fall for a fake chevron and notification which can be clicked on to serve up malicious content. But a bigger problem, as far as Lawrence is concerned, is that some attacker data is allowed above the line of death, such as an icon and page title, which is in control of the attacker, as it's the attacker's domain name in the address bar. Lawrence said this may consist entirely of deceptive content and lies. Another problem is the web content. “Nothing in this area is to be believed. Unfortunately, on windowed operating systems, this is worse than it sounds, because it creates the possibility of picture-in-picture attacks, where an entire browser window, including its trusted pixels,” he warned. He said that even defences such as using a custom theme (as this would show up a fake window in default colours) wouldn't protect users against such attacks. Such attacks have rendered Extended Validation (EV) certificates pointless as they can also fake a green padlock, used for denoting validated sites. Lawrence said that his favourite mitigation technique for this kind of attack was a proposal that browsers should use PetNames for site identity. “Not only would they make every HTTPS site's identity look unique to each user, but this could also be used as a means of detecting fraudulent or mis-issued certificates (in a world before we had certificate transparency),” he said. However, the line of death has all but gone with the advent of HTML5-based browsers as this allows fullscreen windows without any address bar or chrome. He said that the Metro/Immersive/Modern mode of Internet Explorer in Windows 8 suffered from the same problem; because it was designed with a philosophy of “content over chrome”, there were no reliable trustworthy pixels.  “I begged for a persistent trust badge to adorn the bottom-right of the screen (showing a security origin and a lock) but was overruled. One enterprising security tester in Windows made a visually-perfect spoofing site of PayPal, where even the user gestures that displayed the ephemeral browser UI were intercepted and fake indicators were shown. It was terrifying stuff, mitigated only by the hope that no one would use the new mode,” he said. He added that virtually all mobile operating systems suffer from the same issue. “Due to UI space constraints, there are no trustworthy pixels, allowing any application to spoof another application or the operating system itself,” said Lawrence.

It hopes to cooperate closely with a hardware manufacturer to launch a device priced US$300 or less in the first half of 2017 this year. This new handphone will be part of Google’s “Android One” programme. The program first debuted in India in 2014. Google is asking those involved in the Android One program, more specifically, their manufacturers to produce devices that will adhere closely guidelines so that a pure Android experience will be what users receive and there won’t be any unnecessary customizations or bloatware. Google will support its manufacturers with ad campaigns to help with sales too. Budget phones though, are everywhere now. There isn’t a shortage of them at all. Telcos regularly give off low-cost smartphones and pretty much every company has a cheap device you can get for $100-$200. However, these devices are often subpar in quality with horrible hardware and outdated Android software. Furthermore, most manufacturers customise the user interface of Android to give their phones a unique look and feel. This gives each company’s phone a signature look, but it comes at the cost of bloatware. Personally, I find the stock Android look much more appealing. In addition, Google doesn’t like this kind of customisation as it undoes some of the work that the company itself has spent trying to design Android, and also because these various tweaks by manufacturers hinder the update process across Android OS phone.   Leave a comment SCAN THIS QR CODE WITH YOUR PHONE Close Next Post Microsoft To Ship Their Mixed Reality Headsets This March Related Post Another alleged LG G6 image crops up online Just a few days back, we saw the very first image of the upcoming LG Related Post New leak reveals complete specs of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 In a new report published on Venture Beat earlier today, smartphone leakster Evan Blass detailed Tags Android Android One Google Google Pixel HTC Samsung smartphone © 1999 - 2016 VR Zone AP Pte.

However, there's a catch for those interested in using the feature.  ( Andreas Proschofsky | Google+ ) Advertisement Google has started to roll out a new feature for Android devices that will allow users to remain connected to the internet when their connection is lost. Named Instant Tethering, the feature that is part of Google Play Services 10.2 makes it easier for users to utilize their Android devices as mobile hotspots. How Does Instant Tethering Work? According to a post by Austrian journalist Andreas Proschofsky on his Google+ account, when instant tethering is activated, Android devices with no internet connections will be offered to go online by sharing the data of other smartphones and tablets. The device that would like to go online and the one that will be sharing its internet connection should be linked to the same Google account, with the negotiations of the connection facilitated through Bluetooth. It is very easy to use the feature, as once the initial set-up of the user agreeing to use it has been completed, there will be no further set-up necessary for Instant Tethering. A prompt will simply appear on the screen of the device with no connection asking if the user would like to connect to a mobile hotspot that will be created by a linked Android device. However, the prompt also warns that the device that will function as the mobile hotspot will use cellular data, will use up its battery quicker, and will disconnect from any Wi-Fi networks that it may be connected to at the time. What's The Catch? Instant Tethering sounds like a feature that will be very useful for people who own several Android devices, but with only one or two of them having access to mobile data. However, Instant Tethering is currently in a limited rollout. According to Android Police, the feature is being launched first for Pixel and Nexus devices that are being powered by Android 7.1.1 Nougat. The Pixel C and Nexus 9 are also being granted the feature, but will be limited to being clients that can connect to the mobile hotspots offered by other Android devices with Instant Tethering. The Pixel C and Nexus 9 will not be able to function as mobile hotspots, but they will be able to connect to mobile hotspots created by the feature even if they are still on Android Marshmallow. Android Police added that there is a server-side component to Instant Tethering, so compatible devices which have installed Google Play Service 10.2 might not see the feature appear right away. For these devices, it is recommended to have them restarted as that might do the trick of launching the feature. When Will Instant Tethering Roll Out To All Android Devices? Google has not issued an expected date for Instant Tethering to be rolled out to all Android smartphones and tablets. However, as the feature continues to be tested on Pixel and Nexus devices, more Android devices should start seeing the Instant Tethering option. Users with non-Pixel and Nexus devices should keep checking Google Play Services every once in a while to see if the feature has arrived on their device.

Amazon and Google always thrive in the fourth quarter as people get out their wallets for Christmas. Both companies – or in Google’s case, its parent group, Alphabet – are therefore expected to announce booming revenues in their fourth-quarter results over the next fortnight, with Alphabet going first on Thursday and Amazon the following week. But analysts are already looking beyond the simple question of how many cardboard boxes Amazon filled and how many searches Google answered. They’re wondering which company will win the battle to control your home. That battle is being fought by two carafe-sized cylinders from the respective companies. One is Amazon’s Echo, with its voice-operated “personal assistant”, Alexa; the other is Google Home, which responds to the phrase “OK Google”. Both are internet-connected, home-based devices which can be command to do things: give the weather forecast; play music; read out news headlines; update shopping lists; and control “smart” devices in the home such as light bulbs or power points. In theory, if a device can be linked to it, the Echo can control or monitor it, and keep you informed. And simply by saying “Alexa, add sugar to the shopping list”, users can keep up to date on house supplies and even purchase them directly. Amazon is in the lead, having launched the Echo in November 2014, two years before Google Home came out. Though Amazon has not – and does not – release sales figures for any individual item, investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that 11m Echos had been sold by the end of November 2016; other estimates suggest a further 7m have been sold since. About 700,000 were estimated to have been sold in the UK and Germany, the only countries outside the US where it is available. The Morgan Stanley estimate would put an Echo in more than 8% of US households. This is a significant figure, especially compared with the best estimates for Google Home, which put its sales at less than a million since its launch in October 2016. Why should Google care about Amazon? Because voice is seen as the next big field for computer interaction, and the home is a far better environment for voice detection than the great outdoors. Research company Gartner reckons that by 2018, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type, and the technology behind voice interaction is improving all the time. The risk to Google is that at the moment, almost everyone starting a general search at home begins at Google’s home page on a PC or phone. That leads to a results page topped by text adverts – which help generate about 90% of Google’s revenue, and probably more of its profits. But if people begin searching or ordering goods via an Echo, bypassing Google, that ad revenue will fall. And Google has cause to be uncomfortable. The shift from desktop to mobile saw the average number of searches per person fall as people moved to dedicated apps; Google responded by adding more ads to both desktop and search pages, juicing revenues. A shift that cut out the desktop in favour of voice-oriented search, or no search at all, would imperil its lucrative revenue stream. Amazon is copying one feature of Google’s success in smartphones: it is offering methods to connect and control smart devices via the Echo for free, rather as Google’s Android software was offered as a free platform for smartphones. There are signs it is paying off: Wynn hotels in Las Vegas announced in December that it would be adding Echos to all 5,000 rooms, for functions such as playing music and controlling curtains and blinds. That gained some notice, as much as anything because the life cycle of such hotels implies they will be there for a decade or so. Similarly, at January’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), also in Las Vegas, commentators were struck by how many devices incorporated Alexa. And Amazon is even stealing into Google’s territory: some phones sold in the US from China’s Huawei, which uses Android, will incorporate Alexa rather than Google’s Assistant programme. Google’s natural reaction is to have its own voice-driven home system, in Home. But that poses a difficulty, illustrated by the problems it claims to solve. At the device’s launch, one presenter from the company explained how it could speak the answer to questions such as “how do you get wine stains out of a rug?” Most people would pose that question on a PC or mobile, and the results page would offer a series of paid-for ads. On Home, you just get the answer – without ads. What analysts wonder is: how can Home bridge that revenue gap? So far, Google hasn’t explained. Even if it can fend off the Echo, it may not be able to defend its core business. By contrast, the Echo’s benefit to Amazon is much clearer: it can make online shopping (at Amazon) a breeze, play music from Amazon’s paid-for subscription service, and generally act as a passive block on your using rival shopping sites – rather as Google cemented its dominance by being the default search engine on multiple browsers in the mid-2000s. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research suggests that time is running out for Google: “It has to act quickly, as Amazon is on the brink of becoming the industry standard for controlling smart home devices. “At CES, everyone was integrating with Echo, with Google Home and Apple HomeKit barely present.” Indeed, where are Apple and Microsoft, which also have their own voice-driven assistants in the form of Siri and Cortana? Although both can be used in the home – Siri on the iPhone or iPad, and to play content on the Apple TV set-top box, and Cortana on the Xbox games console – neither seems to be intent on the “home assistant” market. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice-president of marketing, seemed to suggest recently that Apple wouldn’t follow Amazon and Google into offering a voice-only device: “Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” He also emphasised the importance of a visual display: “We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.” Even so, there are persistent rumours that Apple has prototyped an Echo-like device in secret but is undecided on whether to release it. The company hasn’t commented. It could be ready to unveil something – or may never do so. Microsoft, meanwhile, is in more homes than the Echo via the Xbox, but isn’t trying to make itself a listening device linked to a shop. So, will we all be burbling away to thin air in a few years, asking how long our commute will take while our smartphones sit unused in the kitchen? Perhaps – though Ken Sena, a senior analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, suggests that home-based voice assistants will never be used as widely as smartphones. According to Sena, they are not such a must-have. Yet, they were a hot Christmas present – and voice interaction is still in its early days, perhaps comparable to the smartphone market in 2005, when BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft dominated. Or, it could be like the smartphone market now, effectively dominated by Google and Apple. But which? Alexa, can you see into the future?

A Staff Writer It is important for policymakers to closely examine how the advent of industrial robots and their impact on manufacturing transformed companies in other developing nations. Photo: Reuters With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy, recommends an August 2016 report titled India and the Artificial Intelligence Revolution. Authored by Shashi Shekhar Vempati of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the report advocates spurring AI-based innovation and establishing AI-ready infrastructure as prerequisites for preparing India’s jobs and skills markets for an AI-based future and securing its strategic interests. Here are highlights from the report: AI’s potential in India Thanks to the increasingly digital economy, fuelled by improving education and globalization, the Indian consumer is unknowingly the country’s biggest beneficiary of recent advances in AI, notes the report. From utilizing various applications powered by AI to using a range of online services such as Amazon Marketplace and Netflix that learn from consumers’ online behaviour to make intelligent product and service recommendations, consumers are readily engaged with the proliferation of AI in India, whether they appreciate it or not. Policymakers, however, lag behind, not exploiting AI for national security, public services, or other priorities. Indian academics, public researchers, labs, and entrepreneurs face a different challenge than the corporations that dominate the space—the infrastructure necessary for an AI revolution in India has been neglected by policymakers. Why China is stealing a march in AI research While lack of physical infrastructure is certainly a major impediment, India’s AI development also suffers from the paucity of the necessary cultural infrastructure, which is key for recent advances from lab to marketplace in AI. Fostering a culture of innovation and a commitment to research and, most important, nurturing an ecosystem beyond the four walls of the organization are all common to Google’s DeepMind, IBM’s Watson, and Baidu’s Institute of Deep Learning, the most successful AI projects of the past half decade. While it must come as no surprise that Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, and other global technology giants have invested significantly over the decades in machine intelligence, it is the story of Baidu that holds the most pertinent lessons for India. The story of AI at Baidu is the story of Andrew Ng—an associate professor at Stanford University who teaches a popular course on machine learning (also available via Coursera, an online learning platform that he co-founded). Ng was hired away from the Google Brain project in 2014, following which Baidu invested heavily in physical infrastructure. Baidu is investing in deep speech for voice-based searches that leverage speech recognition. This intelligence is being built for understanding and interpreting queries in Mandarin rather than English; as such, Baidu is constructing a uniquely Chinese platform, independent of that which is used ubiquitously in the English-speaking West. This version of AI thus offers the possibility for the development of AI in India, as an example of AI technology successfully developed in and employed by a non-Western nation. Baidu’s investment in AI research exposes the relative backwardness of India’s technological infrastructure: China has recognized the importance of bridging the gap between the lab and the market while nurturing a research and innovation ecosystem unbounded by national borders and corporate firewalls. India, in contrast, boasts neither the material nor the cultural institutions required for such innovation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi often challenges Indian IT entrepreneurs, asking when India will give birth to the next Google or Microsoft. But until India attains the infrastructure omnipresent in the US, and increasingly existent in China, the deep-learning capabilities necessary to address the vast linguistic diversity across India using machine intelligence may prove elusive. AI’s impact on Indian jobs While India dreams of its own manufacturing revolution through Modi’s Make in India programme, it is important for policymakers to closely examine how the advent of industrial robots and their impact on manufacturing transformed companies in other developing nations. Consider the case of Foxconn—one of the world’s largest contract manufacturers for electronics. In 2015, Foxconn made news when its chief executive, Terry Gou, predicted that 70% of all manufacturing in Foxconn’s assembly lines would be automated with robots displacing humans. Some back-pedalling later, his estimate was scaled down to 30%. Foxconn is among the top owners of robotics patents filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and produces thousands of industrial robots a year that in aggregate are capable of performing more than ten types of manufacturing tasks. This is expected to have a significant impact on the workforce: as many as 60,000 workers have been displaced by robots in one Foxconn factory alone in the Kunshan region of China. China was projected to have more installed industrial robots by the end of 2016 than any other country, with more than 30 robots for every 10,000 industrial workers. If China were to increase that density, employment would be further damaged. While the dire predictions of a robot takeover of manufacturing have not come to pass, the reality of automation is that manufacturing is unlikely to create jobs at the scale that it did in the past. Quoting the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013 on future employment projections, Darrell M. West of the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings highlights how jobs will decline over the next decade in manufacturing and information technology among other sectors. Writing in Pacific Standard magazine, Frank Levy, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, places jobs dislocation on account of AI in perspective when he dismisses the dire projections of a robot takeover. According to Levy, the greatest area of concern for policymakers ought to be the impact of AI on jobs in the middle-skill category—assembly line workers, clerical workers, and the like. Levy also warns of significant dislocation caused by automation leading to a reduction in an individual’s potential for upward mobility. He emphasizes that a good education will be critical to acquire the necessary skills and to be competitive in this evolved labour market. In their book The Second Machine Age, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee make several specific policy recommendations for coping with the job crisis likely to be spurred by AI. A key recommendation of particular importance for India, given Modi’s Startup India initiative, is the need to “restart startups”. Brynjolfsson and McAfee view creative destruction inherent within the start-up economy as the best bet for experimenting with the new jobs and industries that can thrive in an AI-driven economy. The authors provide examples of start-ups such as TaskRabbit and Airbnb that contrive previously non-existent economic opportunities for ordinary people with spare time and assets, thus creating economically productive work. Skill development for future jobs Not everyone is as sanguine as Brynjolfsson and McAfee about the coming AI revolution. The recent victory of AlphaGo (a computer program developed by Google DeepMind) over the world champion in Go has prompted fears of the threat posed by intelligent machines that are capable of superhuman tasks. The direst warning comes from noted physicist Stephen Hawking, who apocalyptically predicts the end of the human race with the development of “full artificial intelligence”. In the provocative book Humans Need Not Apply, Jerry Kaplan, an American computer scientist and futurist, explores this and several other questions while attempting to paint a picture of an apocalyptic future and what it might look like if and when machines take over. Specifically, Kaplan raises two issues that should be of interest to policymakers in India. The first is the education system and the second involves skills and jobs. While discussing the likely impact of AI on labour markets, Kaplan poses the radical question: Is the current system of sequential education and work outdated, and does it require an overhaul? In his book, Kaplan also proposes a so-called “job mortgage” as a new type of financial instrument through which employers, vocational schools and colleges would have an incentive to collaborate in a new way. In this proposed job mortgage market, Kaplan attempts to use free market mechanisms to match current skills acquisition to future job opportunities. He proposes to accomplish this by compelling employers to commit to an intent to employ an individual in the future if that person commits to acquire a specific set of skills over a certain time frame. India will have to experiment with the kind of innovative instruments that Kaplan proposes if it is to prepare itself for the challenges from a machine intelligence-driven economy in the near future.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 23 January 2017 Secure your digital life by tan kit hoong Value your data: While many of us can afford to lose our smartphone, we can't risk having our private info stolen. — Reuters Our smartphones and PCs hold a lot of our sensitive data. Here's a guide on how to keep your digital devices safe in an online world Before the Internet, the only way to get a virus on your computer was via the ­venerable floppy disk. With a few exceptions, most viruses in those days were just silly – and relatively benign – pranks that made the PC do weird things. Today, however, the world is a different place – with the rise of e-commerce and e-banking, hackers now have more sinister motives when creating malware, such as stealing credit card details or private information. With almost all our devices connected to the Internet in some way, making sure our smartphones, tablets and computers stay free from malware is like trying to navigate a minefield. We’ve compiled the best tips to help you keep your online life safer – do remember that there is no one solution that can protect you. To stay safe in the digital world, you need a combination of best practices and ­programs. Smartphone security Many of us don’t realise how much private information is stored on our smartphones until the day it’s stolen or lost. A good indication that the online banking site is secure is a little green lock icon which appears next to the URL in the address bar in your web browser. —  TAN KIT HOONG/The Star It not only houses all your online ­transactions but also your private photos and videos, so it’s in your interest to ­protect it by following the tips listed here. Activate screenlock We lock our doors so people can’t come in and steal our stuff, so why doesn’t everybody lock their smartphones with a passcode? If you want to make it more secure, consider using a passphrase with letters and numbers instead of a passcode with just numbers (more later). Even better, if your smartphone has a ­fingerprint sensor, use it instead. It can be a hassle to set it up but you only have to do it once. Most phones will also allow you to turn on a ­feature that will erase the phone after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts – use this with care. Limit your sources If you’re an Android user, you will notice that it will by default only allow you to install apps from the Google Play store. If your smartphone has a fingerprint scanner, you should enable the feature to prevent others from accessing your phone. —  TAN KIT HOONG/The Star If you try to install an app from another source, you’ll be presented with a warning that you’re installing an app from outside the relatively safe confines of Google’s curated store. While Google Play itself is not free from dodgy apps, it’s far safer than third-party sources. By installing apps from a third-party app store, you’re opening yourself up to installing malware unless it’s from a source that you know is safe, like the Amazon App Store. You can check whether you’ve set your Android for installing from third-party ­sources by going into Settings, System, Security and finally Unknown Sources. On iOS, unless you’ve jailbroken it, you only have access to the curated App Store, which is generally safer. Set permissions If you own an older Android that’s running version 5.0 or 5.1 (Lollipop), you’ll notice that whenever you install an app, you’ll get a ­message from the app asking for permission to access stuff, such as your contact list, ­camera or calendar. Most people allow the app to access everything it wants, but it’s worth taking the time to read and understand the permissions it is requesting. For example, while it is logical that the Facebook app will ask for access to your calendar and contacts, something is not right if a flashlight app wants to access your contacts. If you think something is not right, deny the app the permission or don’t install the app. Thankfully, with Android 6 (Marshmallow) and later, Google changed how permissions work. So if you are using a newer Android, apps will only seek your permission when it needs it. This also gives you better control over your apps – you could, for instance, grant an app permission to your contacts but not the ­camera. Whether you are using an old or new ­version of Android, you can always revoke the permissions at any time, by going to the app’s Settings screen. Phishing attacks Phishing (pronounced “fishing”) is, as the name suggests, an attempt to obtain your information like your credit card info or banking login details by “baiting” you. A link is usually sent via e-mail or instant messaging which will take you to a fake website. Nowadays, hackers have become so good at making a fake site look like a legit one that it’s not easy to tell the difference at first glance. So it’s best not to click on the link in the first place, but how do you recognise a ­phishing e-mail or instant message? It’s ­actually not so easy, as some really look like ­legitimate messages. The rule of thumb is to always view any e-mail or message asking you to “verify” your banking or credit card details with suspicion. These messages will also almost always have a link for you to click on. If you want to verify the legitimacy of the e-mail or instant message, it’s better to open the browser and manually type in your ­banking or credit card website so you can log in to your account to check if there are any announcements or discrepancies. At risk of sounding redundant, we’ll repeat – never click on any link in an e-mail that you don’t trust. Another new form of phishing we’ve ­discovered arrives via SMS with the message that you have spent a large amount on your credit card and to call a number if you didn’t make the purchase. Don’t call the number – the scammer is hoping to use clever social engineering tricks to get you to reveal your credit card details. Instead look for the correct number on the back of your credit card and use that instead. Remote device locator If you own an iPhone, you probably know about the Find My iPhone feature – it allows you to locate your iOS device by going to www.icloud.com and logging in with your iCloud username and password. You also have the option of remotely ­erasing your device so your information can’t be stolen. Did you also know that Android devices also have a similar feature? It’s called Android Device Manager and you can find it at www.google.com/android/devicemanager. Android Device Manager gives you the same options as Find my iPhone – you can make your phone ring, lock it up or erase it remotely. Two-factor authentication Two-factor authentication works by ­sending a special login code that you need to enter in addition to your username and ­password – this code is sent via SMS or using an authenticator app. If you are not familiar with the concept, think of it as Transaction Authorisation Code (TAC) or Personal Access Code (PAC) that’s required when making a ­transaction via online ­banking. Two-factor authentication can be turned on for most major websites and services, including Gmail, Facebook, Amazon and eBay. We can’t give you specific instructions because each site has different steps for enabling two-factor ­authentication. For your Google account, you can go to goo.gl/R2xWkg. It may be a hassle, but it’s one of the most effective ways of preventing someone from hacking into your account.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Instant Tethering rolling out to selected devices running on Nougat By Ida Torres - January 22, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Tethering your mobile device is sometimes a very useful thing, especially when you’ve lost a connection and you really, really need the Internet at that very moment. But it takes you basically a few steps to be able to set up your hotspot. It looks like Google may be trying to make it easier as it rolls out the Instant Tethering feature to some of its users, particularly those who have devices running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat as part of the Google Play Services version 10.2. What this feature does is to link up devices that are connected to your Google account to make it easier for them to stay online, even as one device’s connection drops. Using Bluetooth connection, it will ask you if you want to tether to your other device when one of the connection drops. It will also show the battery level of the device, in case you don’t have enough juice to turn on your mobile hotspot. Once you’ve set it up on your settings, there will be no additional steps necessary once it prompts you to connect your device to the other. The Instant Tethering settings section allows you to toggle on/off whether your device will provide data connection or it will get data connection. It seems that for now, the Nexus 9 and Pixel C are supported as clients (will work eve on Marshmallow) while the others like Pixel XL are the hotspot devices. They still seem to be testing out this feature as it is a server side update for now for the Google Play Services 10.2. There are also device and carrier restrictions of course, depending on your plan or data allocation. Go to the main system settings and Google Menu to see if you have Instant Tethering.

This new technology threatens millions of jobs and raises a slew of ethical dilemmas. ― Google picture handout via AFP-Relaxnews DAVOS, Jan 23 ― Evangelists for driverless cars see a bright future coming down the road: Thousands of lives saved, countless driving hours freed up, cityscapes transformed with traffic jams vanquished. But the new technology also threatens millions of jobs and raises a slew of ethical dilemmas ― prospects that were on the minds of business chiefs and politicians meeting at the World Economic Forum this week. “Companies are going to have to start thinking about it, governments are going to have to start thinking about it,” said Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University in North Carolina. “The reality is we can’t just keep our head in the sand like an ostrich,” she told AFP in Davos, singling out the coming impact on employment. In the United States alone, an estimated four million people work as truckers, taxi drivers and in other jobs that are under threat when the driverless vehicles come into widespread use ― a matter of years, experts predict. In October, delivery drivers got an uncomfortable glimpse of the future when a self-driving truck built by Uber’s Otto unit successfully delivered a beer shipment. New game, new players Cars with some autonomous functions ― such as the ability to adjust the speed ― are already on our roads, and more than a dozen automakers including BMW, Kia, Volkswagen and General Motors are racing to get fully self-driving cars to market by 2020. Champions of the technology point to its potential to reduce the 1.3 million road deaths worldwide each year ― too many of them at the hands of a tired or distracted driver, or one who simply did not react fast enough. The auto industry is already changing fast thanks to the advent of services like Uber and electric vehicles, and carmakers are eyeing both the threats and opportunities. Renault-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn summed up the transformations as a “reshuffling of the cards” for the industry. “There is a new game, let’s see who is going to be able to prevail,” he told an audience in Davos. The dash for driverless technology is bringing new players into the car business, notably Google, Apple and BlackBerry. The disruption will create jobs too ― engineering posts and roles in any number of new services. There is talk of mobile doctors’ surgeries and moving nail salons. But the transition will be painful, not least because most cabbies and truck drivers are not qualified to slide seamlessly into new engineering roles. “We don’t have, at this point, really well designed (plans) for re-education,” said EU transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a panel in Davos. “All this massive change that has not been experienced before, because digitalisation is really making dramatic shifts.” Offices on the move How to regulate the new vehicles is already giving a headache to authorities around the world. Inga Beale, CEO of the Lloyd’s of London insurance market, said in Davos that insurers were having to grapple with the question of liability in case of an accident. The US government unveiled a regulatory framework in September, but the carmakers are having to deal with ethical and legal dilemmas too. At the extreme end, if an intelligent car is faced with the terrible choice of killing one person to swerve around a crowd of five, what should it do? There was some relief for the industry when the US government this week found no safety-related defect in a fatal crash involving a Tesla car on autopilot last May. In public, auto bosses are focusing on the ways that going driverless is going to change our lives for the better. Ghosn painted a picture of a world where we are liberated not only to check our emails or watch TV while in the driver’s seat, but also run an entire office on the move. “You can be in the car and do everything you’re doing in the house or in the office ― except that it’s mobile,” he enthused. Eventually, automated transport systems and innovations such as shared car ownership could free up our congested cities and clean up our air, promoters say. For now, the approach is safety-first: the beer-delivering Uber truck had a human watching from the cabin, and a police car in tow. ― AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week Cashing in on connected cars VW to focus on brand building for sustainable growth Ford's new GT is its fastest yet New Subaru Impreza makes impressive start Supercar teases from McLaren, Pagani and Eadon Green New Subaru Impreza makes impressive start New 2017 VW Jetta: Now with Coasting Function Shelby surprises with 2017 Mustang Super Snake Saying goodbye to the Hennessey Venom GT British cars: Iconic for resisting change Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Alexa versus Siri Reutes Video: Miss Universe’s preliminary show starts in Manila Reuters Video: Ryan Gosling brings ‘La La Land’ to Tokyo Reuters Video: Mexicans build makeshift wall around US embassy in Trump protest Reuters Video: President Trump, Melania share 'first dance' Reuters Video: Marketing experts on how best to spend money, time, energy in 2017 Related Articles Facebook tunes trending topics to better deliver news For five contest finalists, a US$20m race to the moon RTD denies claims Uber, GrabCar vehicles barred from road tax renewal Is your digital life ready for your death?

Post an ad Android creator nears comeback with 'essential' phone By: Bloomberg News January 22, 2017 Updated: January 22, 2017 at 3:06 pm 0 Just over two years after leaving Google, Andy Rubin is preparing to take on the smartphone industry he helped create. Rubin, creator of the Android operating system, is planning to marry his background in software with artificial intelligence in a risky business: consumer hardware. Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple and Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its CEO, according to people familiar with the matter. Related: A Siri for your finances? Digit says trust me A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said. The centerpiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint Corp., people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In late 2016, the company registered "Essential" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating software for mobile phones" among its goods and services. It's unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android. While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin's phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple's iPhone and Alphabet Inc.'s new Pixel reside. It's expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Representatives for Rubin and Sprint declined to comment. Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe's most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google's robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin's next venture was a startup incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented reality projects. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. "New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years," he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. "What's the next platform?... It's about data and people training AI systems to learn." Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least $300 million from big investors including Hewlett-Packard, Google, and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The latter, known as Foxconn, is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of 2017 for a price similar to an iPhone 7 ($649).

Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 835.77 -3.38 -0.40% Home to more than 1 million people, Dharavi is one of Asia’s largest slums. Shanty-homes line its narrow alleyways, where open drains run along the ground and electric cables hang overhead. Residents work in a variety of industries—leather tannery, textiles, pottery, recycling—and Dharavi’s bustling market is a retail haven for savvy buyers of leather, jewelry furniture, textiles and more. The slum’s manufacturing and retail ecosystem is worth more than $1 billion on its own. Now vendors in the city-within-a-city are getting help from the IoT. Using 30 beacon devices provided by Google, a group of researchers from the Bombay Industrial Design Center (IDC) at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), along with researchers from Swansea University in the UK, is creating a “physical web” connecting different shops in Dharavi’s markets. The initiative is part of the Google Internet of Things (IoT) Research Award Pilot, announced last February. Overall, Google has provided 100 beacon devices to the Dharavi project. Designed to allow any smart device to interact with real-world objects without having to download specific applications, Google’s Beacon platform lets retailers send timely alerts to nearby shoppers. The wall-mounted beacon can broadcast a web URL to anyone with a bluetooth-enabled smartphone standing up to 30 feet away. Once a customer receives the notification and opens the link, they’re taken to an interactive online marketplace that offers up information on what vendors around them are selling. To make sure would-be customers are aware of the program, shopkeepers have been provided with posters telling shoppers to turn on their bluetooth. “Most people who might be passing by Dharavi’s leather market might not even know that these markets have such good-quality crafty products,” says Chinmay Parab, a master’s student at the IDC who worked on the project. “[This technology will give them] digital visibility.” With the first 30 beacons, researchers targeted Dharavi’s leather stores; for the remaining 70, they have their sights set on Kumbharwada, the potters’ colony, and garment vendors. Researchers will study Dharavi’s beacons for five weeks, though shopkeepers will be able to keep the devices even after the experiment is over. Once programmed, the devices can last for up to three years. Dharavi’s vendors are no strangers to technology: According to The Hindu, many are adept at video chat, Google voice search, and messaging tools like WhatsApp. But some remain wary of the beacons, only 11 of which have been adopted since installations began two weeks ago. “It is taking a bit more time than we expected to convince people, but we expected that there would be an inertia to [adopting] any new technology,” says Parab, adding that researchers are in talks with 19 more shops about participating in the project. Some store owners say they are satisfied with their loyal customer base, although those aware of growing competition from Amazon, Flipkart, and Snapdeal are more likely to experiment with the beacons. No matter how technologically advanced, Dharavi’s market is still an informal one. The government has repeatedly threatened to upend the area’s unregistered businesses and develop residential and commercial skyscrapers on the land instead. Parab hopes that the beacon project might forestall such a result by changing the public’s perception of Dharavi. “The economy that runs in parallel in Dharavi is always ignored under this ‘Asia’s largest slum’ image that we all have,” he says. “We’re attempting to give Dharavi, even though on a small scale, a new digital identity of being a digital hub.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The question is – why? When a person searches a phrase like “Chumlee death” it is either because the celebrity has died or because there is a death hoax floating around the internet. If you were, however, to hop on Google and search “Chumlee” or “Chumlee death” right now, you aren’t really going to find much of anything. Austin ‘Chumlee’ Russell from History’s ‘Pawn Stars’ television series [Image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images] Why? Well, for starters there is the fact that Chumlee isn’t dead. Then, there’s the fact that there isn’t even a Chumless death hoax floating around right now. So, why are people searching “Chumlee death” on search engines like Google right now? Well, it is possible people are just checking on the beloved Pawn Stars star. After all, he hasn’t exactly been in the headlines recently. Per the Kansas City Star, there was a time – roughly 3 years ago – in March of 2014 where the Pawn Stars star was the victim of a death hoax. #Chumlee #Chumlee #dead #2014? #'Pawn #Stars' #death #HOAX #goes #viral #after #weight #..… https://t.co/bnXo9O5bfi pic.twitter.com/myYHZJqmf7 — Trendpics (@Trendingpix) March 17, 2016 The Chumlee death hoax started to swirl on social media after a website called EBuzzd posted a story about it. The website claimed Chumlee died of a heart attack at the age of 31. The website did later recant the story as it wasn’t true. Kansas City Star pointed out the only thing the death hoax story got right about Chumlee was his age at the time. Rick Harrison – Chumlee’s boss at Gold & Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas – also noticed the death hoax and took to Twitter to reassure fans that the Pawn Stars co-star was just fine. In fact, Rick mentioned the fact that Chumlee had actually lost 101 pounds and was in “the best health of his life” at the time the hoax started to swirl. Chumlee’s Boss Rick Harrison Reveals The Price Of ‘Pawn Stars’ Fame And Customer’s Dirty Little Secrets! https://t.co/YO6wgEuvdx — Inquisitr Showbiz (@IQShowbiz) January 17, 2017 Harrison did go on to mention that everyone at Pawn Stars appreciated all of the concern everyone was giving for the well-being of their co-star. Per Snopes, Chumlee is not even the only member of the Pawn Stars family to become the victim of a death hoax. In June of 2016, a rumor started to swirl claiming that Richard “Old Man” Harrison had passed away. The rumor originated on a Facebook page called “RIP ‘Old Man’ Harrison” which was created on June 26, 2016. Despite the Facebook page continuing to post memes and status updates to suggest the “Old Man” had passed away – he was very much alive. His Pawn Stars co-stars nor the History Channel ever made a comment regarding his death hoax. It is, however, possible it just didn’t get as much traction as the Chumlee death hoax did. Austin ‘Chumlee’ Russell [Image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images] It is also possible “Chumlee death” is trending because people are still curious whether or not his arrest in March of 2016 was the death of his career. As KTNV reminds us, Chumlee was arrested in March of last year for multiple guns, methamphetamine, marijuana and Xanax in his home. According to the police report, a search warrant was obtained for Chumlee’s house after an adult female claimed to be assaulted. During the search, police seized all of the following items from Chumlee’s house. A black shirt, digital scales, multiple clear plastic baggies, a clear plastic baggie with white residue, a rolled up $1 bill, a brown bedspread, a.45 caliber handgun and magazine, a smoking pipe, rolling papers, ODV and marijuana in various size bags, multiple Xanax “Zanie” bars, and 12 handguns and rifles. Per USA Today, Chumlee did not see any jail time for his drug and gun related charges. Chumlee is also still very much a part of the Pawn Stars family, and the charges did not appear to be the death of his career. Could Chumlee Be The New Face of ‘Pawn Stars’? Fav Reveals How He Got On Show https://t.co/jYFoACuIf6 — Inquisitr News (@theinquisitr) January 12, 2017 Chances are pretty good people are searching “Chumlee death” to check on the beloved member of the Pawn Stars family and to see if there were any updates regarding his arrest in the earlier part of last year. Fans of the History Channel series, however, will be happy to know “Chumlee death” isn’t trending because the star is dead. For those who are still concerned, Chumlee did post on Twitter as few as two days ago. So, we can be pretty sure he’s still alive.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin gestures during a session of the World Economic Forum, on January 19, 2017 in Davos. Picture: AFP. Google Sergey Brin Email Print Tweet Share World Economic Forum | 5 days ago DAVOS - Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google and one of the most successful Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, says he did not foresee the artificial intelligence revolution that has transformed the tech industry. “I didn’t pay attention to it at all, to be perfectly honest,” he said in a session at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos. “Having been trained as a computer scientist in the 90s, everybody knew that AI didn’t work. People tried it, they tried neural nets and none of it worked.” Fast-forward a few years and Google Brain, the company’s AI research project, has advanced so much that it now, as Brin put it, “touches every single one of our main projects, ranging from search to photos to ads … everything we do. “The revolution in deep nets has been very profound, it definitely surprised me, even though I was sitting right there.” WHERE WILL AI TAKE US? Now that AI is here to stay, its future and potential uses have become even more difficult to predict. “What can these things do? We don’t really know the limits,” said Brin. “It has incredible possibilities. I think it’s impossible to forecast accurately.” In Davos for the first time in eight years, Brin also said that he’s shocked by the level of ambition surrounding the possibilities of where machine learning could take us. “I feel like the Luddite in the room,” he said. AI is the natural continuation of the industrialization of the past 200 years, Brin added, but what does this mean for education, skills and employment? This is also difficult to predict. “I would hope that, as some of the more mundane tasks are alleviated through technology, that people will find more and more creative and meaningful ways to spend their time,” Brin said. “You do see more people that have been freed up over the last couple of hundred years to do work that is more about thinking about or creating things ... and I would hope to see that trend continue. It’s important for people to have freedom to study, financial opportunity to study, and to get meaning in addition to work being an important way in which we exchange money. People find profound meaning in their day-to-day jobs and that’s an important thing for us to preserve.” A major part of Google’s success came from Silicon Valley’s willingness to accept failure, Brin added. “The luck also comes from taking many shots. If I told you all the dumb things I did, we’d need to have a much longer session … We’re lucky to have the environment that tolerates making lots of risky bets and tolerates the failures that inevitably result.” Finally, Brin said that anyone starting out as a young leader or entrepreneur should focus more on having fun than making money. “I had no dreams of such economic success. You should have fun and not be so weighed down by expectations.” This article was republished courtesy of the World Economic Forum. _ _ Written by Ross Chainey, Digital Media Specialist at the World Economic Forum _ _ For more news, analysis and insights on Davos 2017 go to EWN’s WEF portal in partnership with Ashburton Investments.

Here's how you can spot fake news sources easily. By: Sneha Saha Updated: Monday, November 28, 2016, 18:21 [IST] Recently, after the U.S presidential election, both Google and Facebook had been accused of displaying more of fake news leading to the win of Trump. Several websites and news mediums had showcased various examples to support their statement, which is said to have played a great role behind Trump's win. However, even after several claims, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied the blame, but however is supposedly working on filtering out the fake news, which often misguide the users. On the other hand, Google recently revealed that it is working towards controlling the fake news flooding the internet using online advertising service, Adsense. SEE ALSO: Is Downloading Narendra Modi's Official App Safe? Let's Find Out! However, until Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms are starting to filter the rising fake news, there are a few ways that online news readers can distinguish between fake and real news. Avoid These Websites Most websites publishing fake news that ends with, Lo, .Co.com, Com.co and more. Registered website URL doesn't often don't end like these, .com, .in and rest are preferred more. No Author Name For The Article Most news articles will have the author's name as the byline, however, articles with no bylines or authors name, most probably can be fake. Hence, verifying facts is mandatory. SEE ALSO: Beware of These Reliance Jio, Narendra Modi, and Paytm Related Hoax WhatsApp Messages Several Stories Having Same Author Name Just in case you visit a particular website and find that most or all articles are by one single author, it is possible that this news can be fake and verifying facts is suggested. Verify Facts With Other Sources Be it any website, re-verifying the facts of the news is mandatory. Reading and believing on what one website states is not quite recommended, hence reading about the same topic from other websites is a good choice.

Is your digital life ready for your death? Tim Herrera Jan 23 , 2017, International New York Times You’ve probably thought about what will happen to your finances, your possessions and maybe even your real estate when you die. But what about your Facebook account? Or your hard-drive backups? For the past two decades, most of us in the modern world have gradually shifted our central living space online. That’s 20-ish years of documenting our real-life experiences while also creating entirely new versions of ourselves in countless places online. These digital lives are basically immortal, so you may as well figure out while you’re still alive what will happen to them after you’re gone. There are two main things to consider: What will happen to your accounts and what will happen to the data contained therein. For example, you can give someone authority to delete your Google account and to download all your photos stored there after you die. It’s a grim thought, but like writing a last will and testament, this has become just another part of death preparation. Many online spaces offer some form of death planning. But this is still a relatively new concept, and some of the most popular destinations on the Internet don’t give users a way to plan for their death. In that case, it’s best to establish a plan now with a trusted loved one.For the websites and services that do offer help, here’s what to know. Facebook Whom do you trust to mind your central online presence after your death? That’s probably the person you want to be your Facebook legacy contact. This person will be able to write a post that will remain at the top of your profile, update your profile photo and respond to friend requests. You can also allow that person to download an archive of your public activity (including posts, photos and “likes”), but he or she can’t read your messages, so your most intimate secrets will be safe. Alternatively, you can set your account to delete everything once Facebook is notified of your death. Facebook legacy contacts, however, will not also have access to your Instagram account (Facebook owns the photo-sharing app). But Instagram accounts can be memorialised or, if requested by a verified family member, deleted. Google Google lets you choose up to 10 people to be the executors of your account once you die or your account becomes inactive via its inactive account manager feature. To set this up, choose an amount of time between sign-ins for your account to be designated “inactive.” Once that threshold is met (for example, you don’t sign into any Google service for a certain number of months), your chosen contact will get a prewritten email from you with, presumably, your wishes for your account. Unlike your legacy contact on Facebook, you can designate this person to have full access to your Google account, including email and chat histories, and he or she can download the data you specify. (You also have the option not to give that person access to any of it.) Google also allows you to delete your account and all its data. Twitter Twitter has no equivalent to a legacy contact or a way to plan for your online data after your death. It does, however, let a “verified immediate family member of the deceased” delete your account if that person can provide your death certificate and other official documents. A similar protocol is in place in the event a user becomes incapacitated, though in that case someone will have to have proof of power of attorney. In certain circumstances, Twitter says it will consider removing “imagery” of a deceased person, based on “public interest factors such as the newsworthiness of the content.” LinkedIn, Snapchat, Tumblr These three networks offer no type of death planning, although all offer some form of account management for the deceased. LinkedIn will let a verified next-of-kin have an account removed. Snapchat said it can delete the account of a deceased person at the request of a next-of-kin (with a death certificate). And Tumblr will let a next-of-kin request that an account be deleted. Snapchat and Tumblr declined to say whether they’ll eventually add a similar legacy-contact feature, and LinkedIn said it’s “considering” some form of death planning or account memorialisation. Beyond that, many sites (including Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL) have relatively standard protocols in place for immediate family members to request the deletion of a deceased person’s account. Online data backup services Online data storage is an especially tricky part of death planning. The industrywide push for privacy and encryption, while great for personal protection, has created its own problems. “There’s a very real security and privacy implication that can somewhat conflict” with online death planning, said Ahin Thomas, vice president of marketing for Backblaze, an online backup service. “If you set up a private encryption key — we’re not joking — we don’t have access.” In one recent case, a widow contacted the company for access to her late husband’s backups, but the data was inaccessible because it had been encrypted. “It was heartbreaking and sad, and I wish we could’ve done something,” Thomas said. “But the stuff was encrypted.” So what can we do? The best advice, Thomas said, is to simply give the keys to your data to someone you trust. (Some backup services have protocols in place for this.)   Tweet Go to Top Videos Vinay Katiyar's controversial statement on Priyanka Gandhi...

From what I can tell, Aubameyang walked straight off. That miss in the first half, miscueing a tap-in from two yards out, will surely haunt the Dortmund striker for the rest of his career: it would have taken Gabon through as group winners.

The Cameroon winger feints right and goes left, leaving Ze Ondo behind, with the Gabon full back clipping Bassogog right on the edge of the area. Bassogog falls into the area and appeals for a penalty, but the referee rightly awards a free-kick right on the edge. Oyongo crashes his shot into the Gabon wall.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.26pm EST 14:26 20 min: After a good spell of possession from Cameroon, Evouna does well to win a free-kick to get Gabon up the pitch, from which Bouanga tries an audacious effort from 40 yards, trying to catch Ondoa off-guard, who was well off his line. The ball loops up and looks to be sailing into the top corner, but Ondoa just gets back to tip the ball out for a corner.

The 22-year-old, who plays for Tours in Ligue 2, is proving a real handful. He nutmegs his marker on the edge of the box, and flashes a powerful shot just over the bar. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.12pm EST 14:12 4 min: WHAT A MISS FROM AUBAMEYANG! This has to go down as the miss of the tournament, possibly the miss of the season. Gabon have come out of the traps so quickly, and Cameroon look extremely shaky at the back. Bouanga controls a beautiful diagonal pass, and shoots with his weaker left foot. The shot is dragged but turns into a perfect shot for Aubameyang, who is lurking at the back post. The ball comes quickly to him, but no more than two yards out, can only stud the ball wide of the far post. The Dortmund striker holds his head in his hands, and so he should.

Teikeu hesitates under the bounce and Evouna nips in to poke it past the Cameroon defender. Evouna is through on goal, but forced a little wide and chooses to roll the ball across the six-yard box to Bouanga, but Ondoa is brave and throws himself over the ball, smothering it well, somewhat making up for the earlier error. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.06pm EST 14:06 1 min: Ondoa is known as one of the better young goalkeepers at this tournament but he has an absolute howler inside the first 30 seconds, dropping the ball at the feet of Aubangeyang on his own six-yard box. For a moment, there is panic as Cameroon’s defence scramble to hack the ball away, and they eventually do. Ondoa looks as his gloves inquisitively.

Matip withdrew himself for selection for Cameroon in this year’s tournament after being selected in the preliminary squad. He was then suspended from playing for his club side, Liverpool, but received clearance on Friday to play for the club again. Fifa gives Liverpool green light to play Joël Matip against Swansea Read more I’m very happy that this problem is solved and he can play again for Liverpool,” Broos said. “He made the decision not to come with us to the African Cup. I respect his decision but I also think the Cameroon Federation had to do what it has done because they are the Fifa rules and it’s too easy to say ‘no, I don’t come. But this problem is solved. For me, there is no problem any more and I still hope, as I have done since I was coach of Cameroon, that he will come back and play with us again.

His father, Pierre Aubame, was Gabon’s captain in their famous victory over Cameroon in 1994, to help his country to their first ever Africa Cup of Nations finals. A country hit by violence, a national team, calls from some to boycott the tournament and with dwindling attendances this year – the first ever tournament that Gabon has hosted – more and more emphasis has been placed upon the 27-year-old, who has risen to the challenge to score both of his country’s two goals in their first two games, 1-1 draws against Guinea-Bissau and Burkina Faso. Aubameyang P-E (@Aubameyang7) I believe we can do it #gabon #AFCON2017 #CAN2017 #aubameyang #pea #faith 🙏🏽💪🏽👊🏽☝🏽⚡️🌟⚽️🇬🇦 pic.twitter.com/PDVU7W2AGY January 21, 2017 In fact, Aubameyang has scored eight goals in his last 10 games games for club and country, and with both Juventus’s Mario Lemina sidelined with injury, the spotlight is well and truly on the Borussia Dortmund striker. They face a still task to beat Cameroon, who look resurgent after their 2-1 win over Guinea-Bissau. The last time Gabon beat Cameroon was in 2010, when a certain Daniel Cousins, previously of Rangers and Hull City, netted the only goal. The last home country to win the tournament was Egypt in 2006. Cameroon start this game as group leaders with four points, but must get a point to secure qualification. “I think the biggest error we could make would be to play for a draw,” the Cameroon head coach Hugo Broos has said. “That is too dangerous. We will go out to win without doing anything stupid.” Kick-off: 7pm GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close Topics Africa Cup of Nations 2017 Cameroon Gabon Africa Cup of Nations Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports selected soccer selected tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports selected soccer selected MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer selected live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Soccer › Africa Cup of Nations 2017 Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

By the time Alphabet's Terra Bella satellites reach orbit this year, they may not belong to Alphabet anymore. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Jan 22, 2017 at 12:00PM Well that was fast. It was only one month ago that we learned Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is sending up another batch of Earth-imaging "Terra Bella" satellites. The mission is slated to take place sometime in late 2017 -- but now, it turns out, by the time those satellites reach orbit, Alphabet may not even own them anymore. Planet Labs' satellites might not give the most hi-res images, but they still give a nice picture of L.A. and the condition of the reservoirs that water it. Image source: Planet Labs. Spinning on a dime As The Wall Street Journal reports, Alphabet has entered into discussions to sell its entire Terra Bella operation -- the whole kit and kaboodle -- to rival satellite-imaging start-up Planet Labs. This is a surprising reversal, to say the least. In fact, Alphabet only just finished buying Terra Bella in 2014, paying $500 million for the business. As part of Alphabet, Terra Bella's seven orbital satellites have helped to improve the quality of Alphabet's self-built Google Maps, decreasing the company's reliance on outside satellite imaging suppliers such as DigitalGlobe (NYSE:DGI). But Alphabet has apparently rethought the advantages of owning its own photo-snapping satellites and decided it's better to focus on its core business -- and outsource sat-services work to others. After all, as satellite-research firm TMF Associates head Tim Farrar explains, it only costs Alphabet $10 million to $50 million a year to buy all the satellite images it needs from other suppliers. At those prices, the $500 million spent to acquire Terra Bella could keep Google Maps in pictures for anywhere from 10 to 50 years. Factor in the cost of maintaining, operating, and eventually replacing Terra Bella's satellites as they wear out over time, and it becomes even more economical for Alphabet to just buy its pics from outside vendors such as DigitalGlobe and Planet Labs. Is SpaceX next? Speaking of outsiders, you probably recall that two years ago, Alphabet teamed up with Fidelity to invest $1 billion in SpaceX to assist with the latter's effort to build a constellation of broadband internet satellites. This project is a little closer to Alphabet's core internet search business, but it's still something Alphabet can easily outsource to other companies to handle. In fact, Alphabet recently announced that it is halting expansion of its Google Fiber rollout and laying off workers in that division. Soon after, the company pulled the plug on a plan to provide internet service via solar drone. The company is still looking into the possibility of using high-altitude balloons to beam internet service to earth, but given the rollbacks elsewhere, it appears Alphabet may lose interest in this effort as well and begin looking around for someone to buy out its stake in SpaceX. (The good news: If and when such a sale takes place, it would give us an up-to-date look at how the market is valuing SpaceX stock). Final thought: What does all of this mean for investors? Why might Alphabet be pulling back from its space investments? In a word: profits. For some time, analysts have been criticizing Alphabet's "moonshot" investments for blunting profit margins and causing the company to miss earnings targets. By reducing investments in non-core businesses, Alphabet may hope to get its margins moving upwards again. And Alphabet's moves may have follow-on effects elsewhere. Consider: Planet Labs already has more than 100 Earth-imaging microsatellites in orbit. Adding seven somewhat larger Terra Bella satellites to the mix won't grow Planet Labs' constellation very much. What it will do is remove a rapidly growing competitor from this industry -- and hand greater pricing power to DigitalGlobe and Planet Labs. With less competition, DigitalGlobe should become more profitable. And with less competition, the still-private Planet Labs will become a more attractive investment if and when it decides to IPO.

That’s the key message from the annual report by marketing agency SearchMetrics, in a study of 10,000 keyword searches and results on Google. With the search giant’s increased use of machine learning and sophisticated artificial intelligences techniques to display results, smaller travel brands in particular must understand how a subtle shift is taking place in how SERPS (Search Engine Results Pages) are served. Larger travel companies, Searchmetrics argues, have an advantage as Google appears to rank them higher for content than similar items from lower-profile brands. Google is looking to understand the “real intention” behind words used by consumers, in a bid to make results more relevant, says Marcus Tober, Searchmetrics CTO and founder. “With the help of user signals, such as how often certain results are clicked and how long people spend there, the search engine gets a sense of how well searchers’ questions are answered; allowing it to continually refine and improve relevance. For example, on travel-related searches, he explains: “A searcher who types ‘things to remember for my beach holiday’ into the search box is most likely looking for a short list for example; someone who types ‘height Mont Blanc’ wants a single piece of information, while a query like ‘nice beach mallorca’ is most likely wanting a series of images and a ‘how to pack a suitcase’ query might be best served with video content.” Interestingly, word count on content is beginning to become a determininh factor of the placement of sites in search results. This, according to Searchmetrics, is due to top performing results generally more detailed, cover more aspects of a topic (destination, for example). The number of keywords, however, is no longer as important as previously thought of, Tober argues. “Google is no longer just trying to reward pages that use more matching keywords with higher rankings; it is trying to interpret the search intention and boosting the content that is most relevant to the query.” Finally, backlinks are also becoming less important to achieve a high ranking in SERPS. It remains a “strong correlation”, Tober says, but things have changed, not least because mobile searches are now so popular and, generally, pages are more often than not “shared” or “liked”, rather than linked to. He concludes: “Google’s application of machine learning to evaluate search queries and web content means that the factors it uses to determine search rankings are changing all the time. “They are becoming fluid and vary according the context of the search (is it a travel search? An online shopping search? etc.) and according to the intention behind each individual query.” NB: Full report on Google Ranking Factors available here.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Kevin May Kevin is senior editor and a co-founder at Tnooz.

All well all back to school. or lets grow up and get a life 🙂 Thanks for the article Kevin Reply 5 days ago   Mark This will be interesting to watch in 2017. If Google is able to reduce the importance of back links enough it will give newer websites a fighting chance to compete with the larger more established sites simple by creating more targeted content.

TeamIndus is one of four teams participating in a lunar launch project funded by the Google Lunar Xprize, with the current launch date set as December 28, 2017. The team won a $1 million Milestone prize for their proposed landing technology. The Google Lunar Xprize is described as a “competition [in which] both Google and XPRIZE seek to foster a new space economy of innovation and entrepreneurship through low-cost, efficient access to the Moon,” according to the official website. The Team Original Gravity experiment would test the viability of brewing beer on the moon’s surface while studying how yeast behaves in low gravity environments. The study of yeast in space would extend far beyond brewing applications - it is hugely important in the baking process as well as in the manufacture of certain pharmaceuticals on which humans have become dependent, such as insulin.

The team also hopes to combine the fermentation and carbonization processes which would reduce the number of variables when dealing with quantities of CO2 produced while brewing, thus making the overall lunar brewing process far safer. The normal process for testing fermentation and yeast viability in general involves gravity but, as this will be taking place in a low gravity environment, the team will instead use pressure testing rather than density testing methods to check the yeast. “Converting the pressure build up to fermentation progress is straightforward, as long as volume and original gravity—specific gravity before fermentation, hence our name—are known prior to the experiment,” said Han Ling, the team’s head of brewing. “The yeast study is among the coolest experiments to be performed on the lunar surface, and I am sure they are one of the top contenders to win the Lab2Moon competition,” Siddhesh Naik, member of TeamIndus and mentor to Original Gravity, said. The beer would be brewed in a space equivalent to the size of a soda can, complete with three individual compartments that mimic the standard brewing process carried out on Earth: One section will contain the unfermented beer, the next the yeast, and the final compartment will be used to siphon off the final product once mixing has taken place after touchdown on the lunar surface. © universityofcalifornia.edu All applications for the coveted spot aboard TeamIndus’ craft will be evaluated by an international jury in March. The top prize for the competition is $20 million and will be awarded to whichever team successfully completes all of the mission guidelines.

Greater Latrobe students soon could take virtual field trips deep below the surface of the Pacific Ocean and to the International Space Station on the far reaches of Earth's orbit, thanks to Google Expeditions technology. Such “memorable learning moments” through the Google app are meant to fully engage students, offering them academic, cognitive and behavioral benefits, said Robin Pynos, the school district's director of technology, curriculum and instruction. “These are journeys that you can take virtually to almost anywhere,” she said. “There are over 200 expeditions available through the app.” Destinations and topics include historic sites, natural wonders, Penn State's Beaver Stadium and inside the human body. Students can use the app for exploring careers, sampling a day in the life of workers ranging from a veterinarian to an airline pilot, Pynos said. At their Tuesday meeting, school directors donned goggles linked to the app that allowed them to explore the habitats of bull sharks swimming near Fiji, a whale shark off the coast of Mexico and other finned denizens of the deep. Pynos narrated a series of 3-D images and placed arrows to guide participants to points of interest. Goggle-wearers tilted their heads up and down and twisted in their chairs to view the 360-degree scenes from various angles. After instructors are trained, the learning tools will be in the hands of students in about a month, Pynos said. Greater Latrobe was selected last spring to help pilot the Expeditions app software. The district later purchased two Expeditions hardware kits, each including a teacher tablet, phones for the app and goggles for use by up to 30 students. Coordinated by district media specialists, one kit will be shared by the senior high and junior high and the other will rotate among Greater Latrobe's three elementary schools. To help with the $20,000 price of the kits, the district tapped $2,250 from a recent grant of more than $200,000 the Greater Latrobe Partners in Education Foundation provided to assist with technology and instructional initiatives. In other business, the board promoted Richard Kozusko from assistant softball coach to head coach, with a $4,840 salary, after Alexa Pinto's recent resignation. The senior high auditorium will host the Westmoreland County Music Educators Association Junior High County Band Festival at 2 p.m. Saturday. A consultant with Pittsburgh's PERSAD Center will address issues facing LGBTQ students at the next Conversations with the Superintendent session, set for 9:30 a.m. Feb. 6 in the Center for Student Creativity. An information night for parents of children who will enter kindergarten in August will be held from 6:30-7:30 p.m. Feb. 6 in the senior high auditorium. Jeff Himler is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

But the time is ripe for YouTube to strike, according to Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves, who laid out a possible battle plan in a note distributed on Friday. “Google’s extraordinary data and ability to deliver video across platforms position it to disrupt traditional pay TV and capture TV ad dollars, in our view,” Hargreaves wrote. YouTube hasn’t yet “meaningfully” encroached on the $200 billion global TV ad budget, he said. The main problem is that YouTube still doesn’t have a big enough volume of high-quality, long-form video: the type you would get on TV, or on Netflix. That’s a hard issue for YouTube to fix with its current business model, but Hargreaves reckons YouTube’s secret weapon could be the launch of its own streaming TV service (“vMVPD”), which would directly compete with cable and satellite TV. The battle for streaming TV For months, it’s been rumoured that YouTube is working on a streaming TV service called “Unplugged.” YouTube is reportedly looking to charge under $35 dollars a month for the service, which you could watch on your TV, phone, laptop, and so on. In December, CBS CEO Les Moonves appeared to accidentally both confirm that YouTube is building its own TV package, and also that CBS had already signed a deal for it. Spencer Platt/Getty Images If Unplugged comes to fruition, it will be entering a crowded market. Dish’s Sling TV, AT&T’s DirecTV Now, and Sony’s Vue are already fighting over cord-cutters, and Hulu will enter the picture in the next few months. Even Amazon is rumoured to be working on its own TV package. There’s stiff competition from both established TV distributors and tech companies. But that doesn’t mean YouTube should sit this one out, according to Hargreaves. “Given the nature of distribution online, with virtually no geographical barriers and low consumer switching costs, and the magnitude of the advertising opportunity, we believe Google should be aggressive in both the resources it applies to the service and the retail pricing,” he wrote. YouTube should play to win. Just make it work One thing that could give YouTube an early edge is if it nails the technical aspects of Unplugged. The idea of a live streaming TV service is new, and the reference point, for most people, on how TV is supposed to function is cable or satellite. These services, while subject to the occasional glitch once in a blue moon, largely function as advertised. When you want to watch something, it’s there. AT&T The same cannot be said for the early streaming TV services. Since its launched in late November, AT&T’s DirecTV Now service has been repeatedly smacked with technical issues, from strange error messages to huge blackouts. And both Sling TV and Vue have had their share of tech snafus as well. YouTube has a ton of knowledge already, not just in delivering online video, but also in “live” online video. If Unplugged actually works 99% of the time on Day One, YouTube will have a huge opportunity to snag market share. On Friday, AT&T announced that it had gotten 200,000 additional paying video subscribers in the quarter ending December 31, “entirely driven” by DirecTV Now. By the end of 2016, DirecTV Now had only been in business for about a month. 200,00 paying subscribers in a month is impressive, and it means there’s a demand for the product. But so far, DirecTV Now has delivered a frustrating experience for many those early adopters, who have taken to forums and Twitter to rant against the service. This is an opening for YouTube. One of the benefits of a streaming TV service is how easy it is to cancel — think Netflix. So if DirecTV Now continues to be struggle with technical problems, YouTube can swoop in. The endgame Even if YouTube succeeds in getting a leg up on its competition, that doesn’t mean the streaming TV market will be an instant goldmine. The margins on the early streaming TV services appear to be razor-thin, and Hargreaves suggests that, initially, YouTube’s margins should actually be negative, given the “magnitude of the opportunity and the volume of competition.” The crux of that opportunity lies in a fundamental shift in how TV ads work. As it stands now, TV networks sell most of the ad inventory for their shows. And in the early days of a YouTube streaming TV service, that’s likely to continue to be the case, with YouTube itself selling only a few minutes of ads per hour on its own service.. But that will change, according to Hargreaves. “Google’s vastly superior data should allow it to monetise its ad inventory at superior rates to networks,” he wrote. “Over time, this disparity should allow Google to capture a greater share of total ad inventory on its service. Played out over several years, we believe the natural evolution of a successful Google vMVPD service [Unplugged] would be for the roles of content supply and ad selling (both currently done by TV networks) to split, with Google managing the ad selling and networks relegated to content suppliers.” In a nutshell, YouTube will be better at selling ads than the networks, and eventually be in charge of selling all of them. And that’s the real endgame and potential for profit: getting control of all the ad dollars.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Rodney Brooks on Pedestrian Interaction, Andrew Ng on Infrastructure, and both on human attitudes Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-01-16 22:08. Robocars Recently we’ve seen two essays by people I highly respect in the field of AI and robotics. Their points are worthy of reading, but in spite of my respect, I have some differences of course. The first essay comes from Andrew Ng, head of AI (and thus the self-driving car project) at Baidu. You will find few who can compete with Andrew when it comes to expertise on AI. (Update: This essay is not recent, but I only came upon it recently.) In Wired he writes that Self-Driving Cars Won’t Work Until We Change Our Roads—And Attitudes. And the media have read this essay as being much more strong about changing the roads than he actually writes. I have declared it to be the “first law of robocars” that you don’t change the infrastructure. You improve your car to match the world you are given, you don’t ask the world to change to help your cars. There are several reasons I promote this rule: As soon as you depend on a change in the world in order to drive safely, you have vastly limited where you can deploy. You declare that your technology will be, for a very long time, a limited area technology. You have to depend on, and wait for others to change the world or their attitudes. It’s beyond your control. When it comes to cities and infrastructure, the pace of change is glacial. When it comes to human behaviour, it can be even worse. While it may seem that the change to infrastructure is clearer and easier to plan, the reality is almost assuredly the opposite. That’s because the clever teams of developers, armed with the constantly improving technologies driven by Moore’s law, have the ability to solve problems in a way that is much faster than our linear intuitions suggest. Consider measuring traffic by installing tons of sensors, vs. just getting everybody to download Waze. Before Waze, the sensor approach seemed clear, if expensive. But it was wrong. As noted, Andrew Ng does not actually suggest that much change to the infrastructure. He talks about: Having road construction crews log changes to the road before they do them Giving police and others who direct traffic a more reliable way to communicate their commands to cars Better painting of lane markers More reliable ways to learn the state of traffic lights Tools to help humans understand the actions and plans of robocars Logging construction The first proposal is one I have also made, because it’s very doable, thanks to computer technology. All it requires at first blush is a smartphone app in the hands of construction crews. Before starting a project, they would know that just as important as laying out cones and signs is opening the app and declaring the start of a project. The phone has a GPS and can offer a selection of precise road locations and log it. Of course, the projects should be logged even before they begin, but because that’s imperfect, smartphone logging is good enough. You could improve this by sticking old smartphones in all the road construction machines (old phones are cheap and there are only so many machines) so that any time a machine stops on a road for very long, it sends a message to a control center. Even emergency construction gets detected this way. Even with all that, cars still need to detect changes to the road (that’s easy with good maps) and cones and machines. Which they can do. Police redirection I think the redirection problem is more difficult. Many people redirect traffic, even civilians. However, I would be interested to see Ng’s prediction on how hard it is to get neural network based recognizers to understand all the common gestures. Considering that computers are now getting better at reading sign languages, which are much more complex, I am optimistic here. But in any event, there is another solution for the cases where the system can’t understand the advice, namely calling in an operator in a remote control center, which is what Nissan plans to do, and what we do at Starship. Unmanned cars, with no human to help, will just avoid data dead zones. If somehow they get to them, there can be other solutions, which are imperfect but fine when the problem is very rare, such as a way for the traffic manager to speak to the car (after all, spoken language understanding is now close to a solved problem for limited vocabulary problems.) Better lanes Here I disagree with Andrew. His statement may be a result of efforts to drive on roads without maps, even though Baidu has good map expertise. Google’s car has a map of the texture of the road. It knows where the cracks and jagged lane markers are. The car actually likes degrading lane markers. It’s perfectly painted straight and smooth roads which confuse it (though only slightly, and not enough to cause a problem.) So no, I think that better line painting is not on the must-do list. Seeing lights He’s right, seeing lights can be challenging, though the better cars are getting good at it. The simple algorithm is “you don’t go if you don’t confirm green.” That means you don’t run a red but you could block traffic. If that’s very rare it’s OK. We can consider infrastructure to solve that, though I’m wary. Fortunately, if the city is controlling its lights with a central computer, you don’t have to alter the traffic light itself (which is hard,) you can just query the city, in those rare cases, for when the light will be changing. I think that problem will be solved, but I also think it may well be solved just by better cameras. Good robocars know exactly where all the lights are, and they know where they are, and thus they know exactly what pixels in a video image are from the light, even if the sun is behind it. (Good robocars also know where the sun is and will avoid stopping in a place where there is no light they can see without the sun right behind it.) Working with people How cars interact with people is one of Andrew Ng’s points and the central point of Rodney Brooks’ essay Unexpected Consequences of Self Driving Cars. Already many of the car companies have had fun experimenting with that, putting displays on the outside of cars of various sorts. While cars don’t have the body language and eye contact of human drivers, I don’t predict a problem we can’t solve with good effort. Brooks’ credentials are also superb, as founder of iRobot (Roomba) and Rethink Robotics (Baxter) as well as many accomplishments as an MIT professor. His essay delves into one of the key questions I have wondered about for some time — how to deal with a world where things do not follow the rules, and where there are lots of implicit and changing rules and interactions. Google discovered the first instant of this when their car got stuck at a 4 way stop by being polite. They had to program the car to assert its right to go in order to handle the stop. Likewise, you need to speed to be a good citizen on many of our roads today. His key points are as follows: There is a well worked out dance between pedestrians and cars, that varies greatly among different road types, with give and take, and it’s not suitable for machines yet. People want to know a driver has seen them before stepping near or certainly in front of a vehicle. People jaywalk, and even expect cars to stop for them when they do on some streets. In snowy places, people walk on the street when the sidewalk is not shoveled. Foot traffic can be so much that timid cars can’t ever get out of sidestreets or driveways. Nice pedestrians often let them out. They will hand signal their willingness to yield or use body language. Sometimes people just stand at the corner or edge of the road, and you can’t tell if they are standing there or getting ready to cross. People setting cars to circle rather than park People might jump out of their car to do something, leaving it in the middle of the street blocking traffic, where today they would be unwilling to double park. People might abuse parking spots by having a car “hold” them for quick service when they want to leave an event. Cars will grab early spots to pick up children at schools. Brooks starts with one common mistake — he has bought into the “levels” defined by SAE, even claiming them to be well accepted. In fact, many people don’t accept them, especially the most advanced developers, and I outlined recently why there is only one level, namely unmanned operation, and so the levels are useless as a taxonomy. Instead the real taxonomy in the early days will be the difference between mobility on demand services (robotaxi) and self-drive enabled high end luxury cars. Many of his problems involve privately owned cars and selfish behaviour by their owners. Many of those behaviours don’t make sense in a world with robotaxis. I think it’s very likely that the robotaxis come first, and come in large numbers first, while some imagine it’s the other way around. Unintended consequences Brooks is right that there will be unintended consequences, and the technology will be put to uses nobody thought of. People will be greedy, and antisocial, that can be assured. Fortunately, however, people will work out solutions, in advance, to anything you can think of or notice just by walking down the street or thinking about issues for a few days. The experienced developers have been thinking about these problems for decades now, and cars like Google’s have driven for 300 human lifetimes of driving, and that number keeps increasing. They note every unusual situation they encounter on every road they can try to drive, and the put it into the simulator if it’s important. They’ve already seen more situations than any one human will encounter on those roads, though they certainly haven’t driven all the types of road in the world. But they will, before they certify as safe for deployment on such roads. As I noted, only the “level 4” situation is real. Level 5 is an aspirational science-fiction goal, and the others are unsafe. Key to the improved thinking on “levels” it is no longer the amount of human supervision needed that makes the difference, it is the types of roads and situations you can handle. All these vehicles will only handle a subset of roads, and that is what everybody plans. If there is a road that is too hard, they just won’t drive it. Fortunately, there are lots of road subsets out there that are very, very useful and make economic sense. For a while, many companies planned only to do highways, which are the simplest road subset of all, except for the speed. A small subset, but everybody agrees it’s valuable. So the short answer is, solutions will be found to these problems if the roads they occur on are commercially necessary. If they are not necessary, the solutions will be delayed until they can be found, though that’s probably not too long. As noted above, many people do expect systems to be developed to allow dialogue between robocars and pedestrians or other humans. One useful tool is gaze detection — just as a cheap flash camera causes “red eye” in photos, machines shining infrared light can easily tell if you are looking at them. Eye contact in that direction is detectable. There have been various experiments in sending information in the reverse direction. Some cars have lasers that can paint lines on the road. Others can display text. Some have an LED ribbon surrounding them that shows all the objects and people tracked by the car, so people can understand that they are being perceived. You can also flash a light back directly at people to return their eye contact — I see you and I see that you saw me. Over time, we’ll develop styles of communication, and they will get standarized. It’s not essential to do that on day one; you just stay on the simpler roads until you know you can handle the others. Private cars will pause and pop out a steering wheel. Services like Uber will send you a human driver in the early days if the car is going somewhere the systems can’t drive, or they might even let you drive part of it. Such incrementalism is the only way it can ever work. People taking advantage of timidity of robocars I believe there are solutions to some of the problems laid out. One I have considered is pedestrians and others who take advantage of the naturally conservative and timid nature of a robocar. If people feel they can safely cut off or jaywalk in front of robocars, they will. And the unmanned cars will mostly just accept that, though only about 10% of all cars should be unmanned at any given time. The cars with passengers are another story. Those passengers will be bothered if they are cut off, or forced to brake quickly. They will spill their coffee. And they will fight back. Citizen based strong traffic code enforcement Every time you jump in front of such a car, it will of course have saved the video and other sensor data. It’s always doing that. But the passenger might tell the car, “Please save that recent encounter. E-mail it to the police.” The police will do little with it at first, but in time, especially since there are rich people in these cars, they will throw a face recognizer and licence plate recognizer on the system that gets the videos. They will notice that one person keeps jaywalking right in front of the cars and annoying the passengers. Or the guy who keeps cutting off the cars as though they are not there because they always brake. They will have video of him doing it 40 times, or 100. And at that point, they will do something. The worst offender will get identified and get an E-mail from police. We have 50 videos of you doing this. Here are 50 tickets. Then the next, and the next until nobody wants to get to the top of the list. This might actually create pressure the other way — a street that belongs only to the cars and excludes the non-car user. A traffic code that is enforced to the letter because every person inconvenienced has an ability to file a complaint trivially. We don’t want that either, but we can control that balance. I actually look forward to fixing one of the dynamics of jaywalking that doesn’t work. Often, people like to jaywalk and a car is approaching. They want to have the car pass at full speed and then walk behind it — everybody is more comfortable behind a car than in front of one. But the driver gets paranoid and stops, and eventually you uncomfortably cross in front, annoyed at that and that you stopped somebody you didn’t intend to stop. I suspect robocars will be able to handle this dynamic better, predicting when people might actually be on a path to enter their lane, but not slowing down for stopped pedestrians (adults at least) and trust them to manage their crossing. Children are a different matter. People being selfish with robocars Brooks wonders about people doing selfish things with their robocars. Here, he mostly talks about privately owned robocars, since most of what he describes would not or could not happen with a robotaxi. There will be some private cars so we want to think about this. A very common supposition I see here and elsewhere is the idea of a car that circles rather than parking. Today, operating a car is about $20/hour so that’s already completely irrational, and even when robocar operation drops to $8/hour or less, parking is going to be ridiculously cheap and plentiful so that’s not too likely. There could be competition for spots in very busy areas (schools, arenas etc.) which don’t have much space for pick-up and drop-off, and that’s another area where a bit of traffic code could go a long way. Allow facilities to make a rule: “No car may enter unless its passenger is waiting at the pick-up spot” with authority to ticket and evict any car that does otherwise. Over time, such locations will adjust their pick-up spots to the robocar world and become more like Singapore’s airport, which provides amazing taxi throughput with no cab lines by making it all happen in parallel. Of course, cars would wait outside the zone but robocars can easily double and triple park without blocking the cars they sit in the path of. Robocars waiting for passengers at busy locations will be able to purchase waiting spaces for less than the cost of circling, and then serve their customers or owners. If necessary, market prices can be put on the prized close waiting spaces to solve any problems of scarcity. So when can it happen? Robocars will come to different places at different times. They will handle different classes of streets at different times. They will handle different types of interactions with pedestrians and other road users at different times. Where you live will dictate when you can use it and how you can use it. Vendors will push at the most lucrative routes to start, then work down. There will be many problems that are difficult at first, and the result will be the early cars just don’t go on those sorts of streets or into those sorts of situations. Human driving, either by the customer or something like an Uber driver, will fill in the gaps. Long before then, teams will have encountered or thought of just about any situation you’ve seen, and any situation you’ve likely thought of in a short amount of time. They will have programmed every variation of that situation they can imagine into their simulators to see what their car does. They will use this to grow the network of roads the cars handle every day. Even if at the start, it is not a network of use to you, it won’t be too long before it becomes that, at first for some of your rides, and eventually for most or all. » brad's blog Bicycle use Submitted by Russell de Silva (not verified) on Wed, 2017-01-18 12:15. I'm hopeful that if robocar interactions with pedestrians and cyclists prove to be safer than those driven by humans, then we will see a big surge in bicycle use for short trips. I have at various times commuted by bike to work, but by far the biggest turn off is the lack of safety. While the benefits to the environment of one less car will be greatly reduced if very small and low performance electric vehicles become the norm, the fitness benefits are obvious. One downside to this might be that bicycle use becomes so common that they impede robocar transport especially before and after school. Add in the advent of e-bikes and commuting by bike over larger distances becomes more attractive. It will be interesting to see if any of this comes to pass. » reply Bike is helped Submitted by brad on Wed, 2017-01-18 18:04. Well, it’s a long time before the human drivers are off the road, many decades at least, so you won’t feel perfectly safe for a while. But one big plus is the ability to easily mix bike and car, with or without robot delivered bikes: Take a car one way and return by bicycle. (Either one way rental bike or bike that came in the car to give you that option.) Ride car into town. Stop part way and finish trip on bike, either for exercise or because traffic is heavy and bike will be faster or pay fewer road tolls. Ditto in reverse. Ride from work until tired, then summon car on phone, which pulls up next to you (tracking as you bike) and then you (and the bike, possibly) get into the car, which is designed with a rack. Also possible to use e-bikes for super energy efficiency and pleasant rides on nice days » reply Classes of streets Submitted by cxed (not verified) on Fri, 2017-01-20 23:22. "They will handle different classes of streets at different times." I have always disagreed with your assertion that computer drivers must be able to drive like human drivers. I believe that is a false hope. It reminds me of orinthopters - seems like a "natural" idea but ultimately not a good one, to chase evolution. But perhaps our opinions will converge with the "classes of streets" idea. Eventually there must be an equilibrium where the last .001% of humanness AI designers are trying to impart to the cars is more expensive than just replacing those roads still classified as problematic. » reply Like human drivers Submitted by brad on Sat, 2017-01-21 04:50. Where do you think I said computer drivers must drive like human ones? I have never said that. I (and many others) have said they should be able to attain a safety record, in their operating domain, that is at least as good as human records, and probably better. » reply Perhaps I misunderstand Submitted by cxed (not verified) on Sat, 2017-01-21 08:50. This may be an incorrect interpretation, but when I see something like this... "I have declared it to be the “first law of robocars” that you don’t change the infrastructure." ...I can only conclude that cars need to get along as well with what we've got as humans. Maybe you can better clarify how cars will be able to deal with human infrastructure if we agree that strong AI to drive cars is not right around the corner. My belief is that very small enhancements to the infrastructure could save enormous AI R&D. Throughout history we've made massive changes to infrastructure if the payoff is good (and for autonomous cars it is). The amount and pace of change needed to allow cars at all (say, from 1925 to 1975) is far greater and faster than anything that would need to be done to completely solve autonomous driving. New topic: I'm curious about your opinion of Udacity's nanodegree in "autonomous car engineering". Thanks. » reply Small changes Submitted by brad on Sun, 2017-01-22 07:45. Even the most tiny of changes to infrastructure take many decades to become universal. The progress in AI is much faster. Nothing here involves strong AI. Certainly being able to handle missing lane lines or strange signal arrangements or odd signs even comes close to that. The answer is mapping. Cars drive the roads (driven by humans and later by software.) Weak AI turns the scans into maps. Live human beings review the maps and data to deal with situations that software can’t handle. If such situations are few, the cost is very reasonable, but even if humans have to review every inch it is still cheaper than changing the infrastructure. And much faster, with no waiting for municipalities to get it done. It’s cheaper to map any road than to physically alter it. It’s easy for the system to see if the real road differs from the map. There the car can rely on its driving ability without an accurate map, or call on help from passengers, or call on help from a remote operations center, or pull off the road if it’s unmanned, in a radio dead zone and the first such car to encounter the changed road. Such situations should be very rare. » reply Infrastructure changes Submitted by SEK (not verified) on Mon, 2017-01-23 07:29. Brad, I see at least two drivers to gradual infrastructure changes: - There will always be a push for even safer transportation. Every life lost in one too much. Infrastructure changes that demonstrates to increase safety will be gradually implemented. This will probably happen in the next decades in parallel to AVs adoption. - The expansion of ODDs can be accelerated by infrastructure changes. E.g. that street that is out of ODD in the sunset hours may adopt a connected traffic light if it will change the ODD status and better serve consumers in that area. Living in region with harsh winters, I'm always wondering about ODDs in snow storm days and the commercial viability of AVs if all snow days are out of ODDs. May be infrastructure changes could expand ODDs in this case. » reply Gradual implementation Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-01-23 15:25. Sure, they might happen, but the problem is this. A car either meets the bar of “safe enough” on the roads or it doesn’t. Safe enough is still not perfect, so there is always room for improvement, and people should work on those improvements. But you create the risk that people will say, “The cars are not safe enough unless they infrastructure meets this standard.” If so, you get cars that can only drive where you have improved the infrastructure. Which are essentially useless cars, or 1% of the utility of cars that can go most places. And they save 1% of the lives. Now the first cars will not go everywhere because they won’t handle every type of road. But it will be the builders of the car making that decision, and doing the effort to improve it. You don’t want a situation where you say, “Cars can’t go on a road until we repaint the stripes” because now you must wait for every local government to repaint the stripes. If you say, “Cars can’t go on a road until the maker of the car builds a driving system able to handle the badly painted stripes” then it’s up to the competing companies to solve the problem. And they solve it 10 times faster than the governments, and they solve it everywhere they compete. If you want to talk about a situation where the cars can handle 99% of the roads, and there is a 1% section where infrastructure improvements might gradually appear, that’s a little more workable. That would not apply to roads, but an example might be traffic lights. A car might be able to read 99% of traffic lights, but some might be arranged so poorly that the car can’t be sure it is reading the light properly. There, you could tell the cities, “please fix this traffic light, or make its state available over the internet” and wait for the city to do that. (But you would still be trying to see if you can improve the car to see the bad traffic light anyway.) There are two kinds of changes cities might do, though. The hardest is physical changes that need bureaucracy and money. Those will always be slow. Other changes are to virtual infrastructure, and can be funded by the car companies, who have the motive to do it. For example, if the change desired is the one that Andrew Ng (and I) have both suggested, that construction crews log in a database before they open up a construction site, that’s not too bad because the work is virtual — provide the cities with a mobile phone app and database that the crews can use. Even give them phones if need be. All the city has to do is make a law, and get the construction crews to add “log the opening of the site” in the checklist they already have for the procedures on starting road construction. » reply Level 4 Autonomy? Submitted by Alan Little (not verified) on Tue, 2017-01-24 03:25. So ... humans with little or no experience or practice at driving only get to practice driving on a dirt road in a blizzard? That's going to work well. Actually, the most terrified I've ever been driving was on an autobahn in Austria in a thunderstorm. Visibility was so bad I wanted to pull over but I couldn't see where the side of the road was, and I was driving so slowly I was scared of somebody rear-ending me. An autonomous car with radar, not dependent on vision alone, would have been far better equipped to be safe in that severe weather situation. » reply Only practice in bad situations Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-01-24 08:32. It is the expectation of many that the period where the cars can’t handle tough conditions is not a very long one, so we don’t have the time to breed a generation of drivers who have no experience and are called upon only when it is difficult. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

 How YouTube could capitalize on its rivals' mistakes, and conquer the future of TV Nathan McAlone Jan. 22, 2017, 10:00 AM 18,449 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki Getty Images YouTube, for all its grand scale in video, hasn’t really done much to disrupt the traditional TV market. But the time is ripe for YouTube to strike, according to Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves, who laid out a possible battle plan in a note distributed on Friday. “Google's extraordinary data and ability to deliver video across platforms position it to disrupt traditional pay TV and capture TV ad dollars, in our view,” Hargreaves wrote. YouTube hasn’t yet “meaningfully” encroached on the $200 billion global TV ad budget, he said.  The main problem is that YouTube still doesn’t have a big enough volume of high-quality, long-form video: the type you would get on TV, or on Netflix. That’s a hard issue for YouTube to fix with its current business model, but Hargreaves reckons YouTube’s secret weapon could be the launch of its own streaming TV service (“vMVPD”), which would directly compete with cable and satellite TV. The battle for streaming TV For months, it's been rumored that YouTube is working on a streaming TV service called "Unplugged." YouTube is reportedly looking to charge under $35 dollars a month for the service, which you could watch on your TV, phone, laptop, and so on.  In December, CBS CEO Les Moonves appeared to accidentally both confirm that YouTube is building its own TV package, and also that CBS had already signed a deal for it. Spencer Platt/Getty Images If Unplugged comes to fruition, it will be entering a crowded market. Dish’s Sling TV, AT&T’s DirecTV Now, and Sony’s Vue are already fighting over cord-cutters, and Hulu will enter the picture in the next few months. Even Amazon is rumored to be working on its own TV package. There's stiff competition from both established TV distributors and tech companies.  But that doesn’t mean YouTube should sit this one out, according to Hargreaves. "Given the nature of distribution online, with virtually no geographical barriers and low consumer switching costs, and the magnitude of the advertising opportunity, we believe Google should be aggressive in both the resources it applies to the service and the retail pricing,” he wrote. YouTube should play to win. Just make it work One thing that could give YouTube an early edge is if it nails the technical aspects of Unplugged. The idea of a live streaming TV service is new, and the reference point, for most people, on how TV is supposed to function is cable or satellite. These services, while subject to the occasional glitch once in a blue moon, largely function as advertised. When you want to watch something, it’s there. AT&T The same cannot be said for the early streaming TV services. Since its launched in late November, AT&T’s DirecTV Now service has been repeatedly smacked with technical issues, from strange error messages to huge blackouts. And both Sling TV and Vue have had their share of tech snafus as well. YouTube has a ton of knowledge already, not just in delivering online video, but also in “live” online video. If Unplugged actually works 99% of the time on Day One, YouTube will have a huge opportunity to snag market share. On Friday, AT&T announced that it had gotten 200,000 additional paying video subscribers in the quarter ending December 31, “entirely driven” by DirecTV Now. By the end of 2016, DirecTV Now had only been in business for about a month. 200,00 paying subscribers in a month is impressive, and it means there’s a demand for the product. But so far, DirecTV Now has delivered a frustrating experience for many those early adopters, who have taken to forums and Twitter to rant against the service. This is an opening for YouTube. One of the benefits of a streaming TV service is how easy it is to cancel — think Netflix. So if DirecTV Now continues to be struggle with technical problems, YouTube can swoop in. The endgame Even if YouTube succeeds in getting a leg up on its competition, that doesn’t mean the streaming TV market will be an instant goldmine. The margins on the early streaming TV services appear to be razor-thin, and Hargreaves suggests that, initially, YouTube’s margins should actually be negative, given the “magnitude of the opportunity and the volume of competition.” The crux of that opportunity lies in a fundamental shift in how TV ads work. As it stands now, TV networks sell most of the ad inventory for their shows. And in the early days of a YouTube streaming TV service, that's likely to continue to be the case, with YouTube itself selling only a few minutes of ads per hour on its own service.. But that will change, according to Hargreaves. “Google's vastly superior data should allow it to monetize its ad inventory at superior rates to networks,” he wrote. “Over time, this disparity should allow Google to capture a greater share of total ad inventory on its service. Played out over several years, we believe the natural evolution of a successful Google vMVPD service [Unplugged] would be for the roles of content supply and ad selling (both currently done by TV networks) to split, with Google managing the ad selling and networks relegated to content suppliers.” In a nutshell, YouTube will be better at selling ads than the networks, and eventually be in charge of selling all of them. And that’s the real endgame and potential for profit: getting control of all the ad dollars.

It goes without saying that this is an impressive number. Furthermore, with so many downloads and such a high rating, it is safe to say that this app is nothing short of great. To explain, 4Shared is basically a huge database in which everything, all files, are shared by its users.

Along with millions of music files, you can also share and download video files, images, and whatever other media which the app supports.

Everyone has at least heard of Spotify, and millions of people across the globe use it as their go-to software for free music. The best part is, although it is technically a radio-streaming programme, you have complete control over what you want to listen to, unlike actual radio. spotify I personally use Spotify myself, and the reason is due to not just its huge wealth of great music, but because it is also legal and it contributes somewhat financially to the actual music artists. All things considered, this popular radio-streaming giant offers an incredible amount of free music. There are intermittent ads, but this doesn’t detract from Spotify’s quality and wealth of free, great music. Google Play Music This app, designed by Google, is essentially a free radio service.

You can now download the Napster app for your phone and receive its free, great music, just like it once provided. Unlike most music-related apps and players, Napster has no irritating ads. Furthermore, you can listen to your music offline. Basically, with Napster, you can listen to your favourite playlist when travelling to work, without being interrupted by ads. Finally, the Napster app at the moment has been downloaded around 70,000 times. All things considered, although Napster is back in a new way, it still greatly delivers like its old ways.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson. ROCK MY RUN Has been rated 4.3 stars which is amazing. Got 1 million+ downloads. Size is quite big. Finally, it’s size is 32 MB. It seems like it requires android version 4.0 or up. Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Gaana: Music & Radio Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. SOUND cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’.. Flow will suggest music based on your listening habits. You can also play unlimited playlists, tune into the radio and catch up on the news or sports, create your own playlists, and generally listen to some of the world’s leading musical icons. The Deezer app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the Google Play website. blinkbox Music A very basic app, blinkbox Music is an app specifically for android users. The app itself offers the essentials, such as unlimited streaming and a ton of free and popular hits. You can tune into top 40 playlists and other great additions.

The app currently holds an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars on the Google Play website.

In total, there are around 100 different genres to browse through, and you can customise your very own channel. Stingray offers the basics of any other great free music streaming app. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website. Torch Music With Torch music, you can experience all the pleasantries of listening to your favourite music without the interruption of ads. Think of Torch Music as an app similar to Spotify without the ads. You can also connect your Torch Music account with Facebook and share what you’re listening to with your friends online.

In order to do this, choose a reliable YouTube converter website and copy and paste the video link. After choosing to convert, the website will take the audio track and you can then download the file.

This is a very broad question which may require a lengthy answer. In its simplest form, a download is a file which has been shared from another computer to your own computer (or device). Like giving an item to another person, a download is essentially like a computer giving an item to another computer. Files come in many forms. Some files are as tiny as a few bytes, whereas some are as huge as a few gigabytes. There are also dozens of different music file types, such as: mp3, mp4, wma, ogg, mpeg-1, wav, and more – all of which correspond to or are usable within different software programmes. For example, mp3 is perhaps the most common file type for music downloads. Mp3 files can be used in almost any music playing software programme, like iTunes or Windows Media Player.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Paid Search Content Marketing Social Media SEJ SUMMIT Tools Advertise 9 Weird but Data-Backed SEO Predictions for 2017 SEO· Syndicated January 22, 2017 SEO Syndicated Larry KimJanuary 22, 2017 VIP CONTRIBUTOR 718SHARES 3.8KREADS 718SHARES 3.8KREADS VIP CONTRIBUTORLarry Kim 718SHARES 3.8KREADS It’s January, which means you’ve probably read about 200 expert predictions on the future of SEO in 2017 by now. But if you stick with me, I promise this post won’t be like any of the other SEO predictions posts you’ve seen so far. When it comes to making SEO predictions, a lot of experts take the safe route. We all know mobile SEO is going to be increasingly important. Talking about the obvious is always safe. If you’re anything like me, the SEO predictions for 2017 have left you feeling underwhelmed. No one has been sticking their neck out this year. Mobile will be big? UX will matter? Really?! You don’t say! I think it’s time for a few more bold predictions – nine of them in fact. These SEO predictions will be a bit more out there – maybe you could even call them a little crazy. Just don’t blame me if/when these predictions become a reality. I’m just the prognosticator, basing my predictions on the things I’ve seen lately – and where I believe Google is heading next. 1. We’ll Experience the Biggest Rankings Shift in the History of Google Major algorithmic changes are always a big deal – from old school classics like Florida and Caffeine to more modern algorithmic updates like Panda, Penguin, Hummingbird, and RankBrain. So here’s my first SEO prediction for 2017: We’ll see the biggest shift in rankings in the history of Google. Machine learning and AI was an undeniable force in 2016. And I expect machine learning signals to become a bigger and bigger piece of the pie. In case you’re unfamiliar with RankBrain, here’s a simplified diagram that breaks it down: RankBrain helps Google select and prioritize the signals it uses for ranking. Engagement is one of the very important signals Google looks at for ranking. It’s been my theory that RankBrain (and other machine-learning elements within Google’s core algorithm) are increasingly rewarding pages that have high user engagement. In other words: Google has built its own ultimate unicorn detector to ensure that the pages people are clicking on and engaging with the most are rewarded with better search positions. 2. …But Nobody Will Notice Anything! Remember how, for a few months before RankBrain was officially announced in that Bloomberg article, everyone in the SEO industry knew a big algorithm update was brewing? Remember all the discussion on Twitter, Facebook, and the top search industry publications? Yeah, me neither because it didn’t happen! So here’s my second SEO prediction for 2017: Even though we’re about to see the biggest shift in the history of Google rankings, nobody will notice anything. RankBrain is more subtle than updates like Panda and Penguin, where up to 90 percent of your organic traffic disappeared instantly overnight. It was easy to see such a ridiculously huge traffic drop, which occurred on a specific date, in your analytics. But with RankBrain, the rankings shift is happening every day, bit by bit, rather than all at once in one big update. Google is shifting traffic away from your donkeys (pages with average or below average engagement) and toward your unicorns (pages that have 5-10x higher engagement metrics than normal). Whatever SEO rank-checking tools or weather reports you’re looking at aren’t set up to notice these small and gradual types of changes. They just get lost in the noise. 3. Google Will Unite Featured Snippets & Organic Listings Why is Google’s featured snippet so often different from its top-ranked organic listing? Basically, Google is currently saying to its users: “Our first listing isn’t really the correct answer, so use this other answer instead.” Huh? Why isn’t the first listing simply “the answer” instead? My third SEO prediction for 2017: Google’s featured snippets and organic listing will converge. Here’s my theory. Snippets were just a sandbox/testing environment where they could try out user engagement signals in search and the rest of the rankings didn’t use them. Now that they’ve bought into this idea, they can consolidate the two concepts. 4. Google Will Kill Organic Positions 6-10 As a result of new user engagement signals being used in search rankings, fewer and fewer people are clicking on results in lower positions, while clicks on the top positions are trending higher. Check out this surprising click curve WordStream put together: (Note: This data was obtained from the Google Search Console, tracking the same set of keywords in the Internet marketing niche for three separate 30-day periods) This chart really illustrates the idea of a subtle change, as discussed in my second prediction. What’s it all mean? That it’s time for my next SEO prediction: Google will eliminate the bottom half of search results in 2017. (Bonus prediction: SEOs will freak out BIG TIME!) As a result of machine learning, I believe Google will decide that it no longer needs to show positions 6-10. The decluttered SERP will be populated with more ads (which will generate higher CTRs than the organic listings they replaced). Think it can’t happen? Let me remind you of that time waaaay back in early 2016 when Google killed right-side text ads on the desktop. But when you looked at the data, it made sense why Google did it: only 14.6 percent of desktop clicks came from the right ads. What happened after Google eliminated right-side ads? CTRs increased, and traffic remained steady. I imagine the same will be true when Google eliminates the bottom half of search results. The actual impact for most websites should be minimal because most people aren’t clicking on those organic listings now anyway. 5. We’ll Say Goodbye to Local SEO Google Shopping (a.k.a. Product Search) used to be great. Then Google changed the game and Google Shopping became a 100 percent pay-to-play system. The local SEO train has gone on for way too long. These are 100 percent commercial queries and Google’s next big land grab. There’s no easy way to cushion the blow for my fifth SEO prediction for 2017, so I’ll just say it: local SEO as we’ve known it will die. Google plans to make $5 billion from local search. So that means one thing: goodbye local organic packs. 6. Black Hat SEOs Will Create Fake Engagement Google already has a pretty lengthy list of tactics that are against its Webmaster Guidelines. Well, expect that list to expand in (or after) 2017. One thing we’ve been talking a lot about so far in this post is the importance of engagement metrics and how this can impact your SEO success. This includes metrics from click-through rates, to dwell time, to task completion rates (a.k.a. conversion rates). Well, you know how it goes. Anytime somebody sees some success with an SEO tactic, then everyone starts doing it. But a select few who can’t make that tactic work legitimately will figure out a way to fake it. This is exactly how the whole link buying problem got started 10 years ago. People knew links increased rankings, so people went crazy buying links, not worrying about quality, only quantity. Which brings us to SEO prediction number six: CTR and engagement hacks will become the new black hat SEO. Look for huge spammer innovation once more SEOs finally start realizing that improving CTR and dwell time also can help improve rankings in today’s machine-learning world. The black hat revolution won’t be televised, but people in the know will know all about it. 7. Google Will Declare War on Tool Providers Why does Google have a TOS (terms of service) and not enforce it? Companies like Raven Tools have been bullied to not include rank checking. But Google allows it on some tools but not others? So, my seventh SEO prediction is that Google will declare war on tool providers that violate their TOS. Why should Google care more about this now? Probably because rank checkers screw up CTR and bounce calculations. A few Google people have tweeted about this actually. If Google wanted to be really mean about it, they could devise a kind of penalty where if they found that you were doing excessive rank checking of your domain, they could infer you were violating the TOS. 8. An SEO Company Will Die Following on the previous prediction, and other factors, here’s my next SEO prediction for 2017: one or more major SEO vendors or service companies will be sold off. Google sometimes “makes an example” of a small company they believe is behaving badly by publicly punishing them so badly that they close. 9. SEO Will Be More Valuable Than Ever Though much of this post may seem like doom and gloom, one thing’s for sure: SEO won’t die. (Though it’s an extremely safe bet the entire practice of SEO will be declared dead and/or dying at least a few times this year!) Despite all of its challenges (and the many more on the horizon), SEO will be an even more valuable marketing channel to the lucky winners in 2017 and beyond. My final SEO prediction: Fewer and fewer winners will win bigger and bigger SEO jackpots.  This post originally appeared on WordStream, and is re-published with permission.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Drobo launches photo storage app DroboPix for Android devices By Ida Torres - January 22, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter While Google Photos and Amazon Photos are pretty good cloud storage services with “unlimited” space, a lot of people have some reservations about things like this, especially if they’re not comfortable having a company like Google privy to your files. That is why the rise of file storage and home servers are inevitable. Drobo is one such brand and now they have introduced an app called DroboPix so you can upload your photos directly and supposedly, securely. DroboPix is part of the myDrobo suite, which also includes Drobo Access which is primarily for files. DroboPix functions just like any other photo cloud storage except for the fact that you can only upload photos and videos if you’re at your home and if you’re on your home WiFi network. It has geolocation verification for another layer of security. It also helps conserve your phone’s battery power and cellular data usage since you can only do it through WiFi. Design-wise, the app doesn’t use the Material Design guidelines from Google but it is pretty easy to use since it’s kind of basic. It is easy to upload pictures and also to check the state of the server and those are basic things that we look for when using an app, especially a cloud storage one. The main problem with this app and the myDrobo suite is that it will only work for those who have the Drobo B810n or 5N servers, two of their Network Attached Storage products. So if you have either of those two NAS products, you get the chance to experience DroboPix.

India has more than 220 million smartphone users. It’s the world’s second-largest smartphone market –after China and ahead of the US – and the Android operating system accounts for 97% of it. Price-sensitive Indians are not only buying more Android devices under $100 (Rs 6,790), manufactured by foreign and local brands, but are also skipping PCs entirely and going straight to mobile computing. All that smartphone activity has done wonders for the mobile-app economy. Last year, Indians downloaded 6.2 billion apps through Google Play, up from 3.6 billion in 2015, according to a recent report by App Annie. That marks the first time India seized the top spot for Android-app downloads, toppling longtime leader the United States. Atlas. Data: App Annie “Phones are not nice-to-have; apps are not nice-to-have,” said Danielle Levitas, App Annie’s senior vice president of research. “They’re increasingly critical because it’s communication, access to information, access to productivity, access to education, access to entertainment.” In countries like India, Vietnam, and Indonesia – Levitas calls them “hypergrowth markets” – there is room to keep climbing the ranks. Even though over 1 billion Indians own some sort of mobile device, for example, only 17% of them own a smartphone. The 220 million is expected to become 810 million by 2020, and increases in app downloads will likely continue through 2017 and beyond. In more mature markets like the US and Japan, app-download rates decline over time (and app engagement picks up) as users settle on their essential apps and visit them habitually. In India, high data costs and spotty networks have made extended engagement difficult. Which makes it all the more surprising that Indians not only downloaded the highest greatest number of Android apps, but also clocked the most time spent on Android devices last year – 145 billion hours, well above No 2 Brazil, at 110 billion hours. Atlas. Data: App Annie This is in part because the mobile economy is adjusting to address the needs of emerging markets, where people may not have affordable or viable 4G connections. In October, Facebook released a less data-intensive, pared-down app called Facebook Lite. In September, Reliance Jio rolled out the world’s cheapest LTE data rates. Google is currently setting up free wifi infrastructure in 400 railway stations across India, and Facebook recently introduced Express Wi-Fi, which allows people to access internet through local hotspots at reduced costs. Unsurprisingly – Apple captures less than 3% of the Indian smartphone market – India did not feature in the Top 10 countries for iOS downloads or time spent on the devices. But the country’s few iPhone owners are avid shoppers: They’ve installed an average of 4.7 shopping apps each, according to App Annie. Atlas.

All because Michel Barnier and his fellow negotiators are unlikely to  give the UK what it wants, a free ride.  Mr. Hammond gave the Welt am Sonntag the ill advised interview, available here (in German), during a short trip to Germany to meet the former tax inspector and current Federal Finance Minister Dr. Wolfgang Schäuble. His aggressive words may reflect the tone of that meeting, rather than the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s perspective on taxation, but in saying them he opened himself & the UK Government to a whirlwind of abuse and ridicule from those with whom he will have to negotiate. The Houses of the Oireachtas returned during the week with the normally flurry of written questions, turning into  an  avalanche of snowy white paper, built up over the adjournment. Going through Wednesday’s questions, one in the name of, Róisín Shortall, the Social Democrat TD, caught my eye. It was, what a former Revenue colleague, who spent much of her time collating responses to PQs, called a “Joan Burton”question, i.e. complex, detailed and requiring special care in approach, as the Deputy knew what she was talking about, or was being advised by someone who was knowledgeable on the subject. The Dáil question was about correlative adjustments and  advised among other things, that the Revenue Commissioners had 43 open applications for refunds of Corporation Tax, arising from transfer pricing audits in other countries. The answer  also makes clear that there may be far more claims, in the pipeline, as the figures did not include those received in December. (A correlative adjustment arises from a transfer pricing audit. If the profit is increased in one country, it follows that the profit falls somewhere else. When this is agreed the company claims an adjustment in one country, reducing the profits there, while paying additional taxes on the uplift in the first State.) The problem for Ireland is the 43 open cases are all likely to be complex cases, perhaps with multiple jurisdictions involved and substantial liabilities attached. Life as a tax haven is becoming more and more difficult. Ireland spent much of 2016 fretting over the Apple case. The Italian tax authorities, the first to hammer Apple (see this story from Dec 2015 in the  www.thelocal.it)  have, based on this scoop (in Italian) from La Repubblica,  now agreed a deal with Google  for €280M plus. This means that the profits of Google Italia have been adjusted upwards by approx. €1,000M (Italian tax rate 27.5%) and Google Ireland Ltd., will be adjusting its profits downwards by a similar amount. This  leaves a  refund of €125M winging its way in the direction of Barrow St.  Ominously, the article suggests the Italians next target is another US company with an Irish sales structure in place, Facebook. Mr. Hammond should carefully consider the road he is suggesting. On Thursday evening Dr. Honohan, the former Governor of the Central Bank warned that low tax FDI models were in trouble. The extremely lean and fit Dr. Honohan has changed little in the past 50 years as this picture of him from his Coláiste Mhuire days shows. He should note that any move to taking aggressive tax positions will be challenged, as the Irish are finding out. The current UK arrangements for foreign individuals (non-doms) are bad enough, without even considering the role of London as the world’s premier money laundering location. The UK may find that all of its current activities come under the scrutiny of re-energised fiscal authorities in other States, who perhaps will all have one major target. The recently silent Michael Taft, in his blog http://notesonthefront.typepad.com, made reference to the over dependence on Corporate Taxes in one of his last blogs last November, available here. Ireland’s willingness to put in place favourable structures for MNCs has led to a flood of cash, which is of course now under threat from the activities of other tax authorities in Europe and beyond. The Dept. of Finance mentioned a repayment of €150M as the reason for a fall in CT in December, which can only have arisen from a correlative adjustment. This perhaps shows the danger of dependence on a “one club” economics. The failure to appreciate that the EU is based on a rules based Civil Law structure, rather than based on a Common Law,” make it up as you go along” approach (precedent) will be the undoing of UK negotiations. Fifty four years after joining, sixty two years after the Messina Conference , they still don’t get it. After the referendum the Guardian published  this extract  from the late Hugo Young’s  masterpiece, This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe from Churchill to Blair (1998). I quote just a few lines, “This is the story of 50 years in which Britain struggled to reconcile the past she could not forget with the future she could not avoid. It is the history of an attitude to history itself. It is a record not of triumph, but rather of bewilderment concerning a question that lay in wait, throughout the period, to trouble successive leaders of the nation, and which latterly tested some of them to destruction. Could Britain, the question ran, truly accept that her modern destiny was to be a European country?” Modern taxation depends on agreed sets of rules, and for the most part the UK played by them. These rules are agreed at different levels, OECD, EU and even bilaterally through Double Taxation Agreements.  However it is no coincidence that almost all major tax havens are Common Law jurisdictions from Delaware to Caymans, most of whom are outside tax treaty networks. If the UK wishes  to opt out, it will be the main loser, but it is also difficult to see how it can do so without the main losers being its own citizens.

But not all hopes are lost, because there are new rumors that the anticipated Pixel 7 tablet will still make its appearance in 2017 and it wills stack against Apple’s iPad Pro 2. According to the latest reports, the Nexus 7 will be released under the Pixel brand, so it will be called Pixel 7. Google is trying to promote its new Pixel line and the upcoming tablet will help the brand gain more popularity. There are still many fans of the old Nexus brand, and it’s quite hard for them to let of their old love, but once they’ll get to know Pixel better, they’ll start to like it. Apple is also expected to release the second generation iPad Pro tablet later this year and there will be only a few rivals that will compete with it in terms of hardware specs. The Pixel 7 will tale on Apple’s iPad Pro 2 with its Snapdragon 820 processor that will be backed by 4GB of RAM, while other specs include 64GB of internal storage that will expanded up to 2TB with a microSD card, a primary camera of 13MP, a secondary camera of 8MP and a display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. The Nexus 7 / Pixel 7 will reportedly run on Google’s Andromeda OS, which is a combination between Chrome and Android OS. However, the new operating system will make its debut on “Boson” / Pixel 3 laptop that will be released in Q3 of 2017. This means that the Pixel 7 will not be released sooner than this period. Google hasn’t confirmed these rumors, so you should take them with a pinch of salt.

While tech titans such as Google, Uber, and Apple along with almost every auto maker on the planet have poured resources into the development of autonomous vehicle technology, online retail giant Amazon has been relatively quiet on that front. But a recently approved patent shows the Seattle-based company could be ready to make a big move in the autonomous vehicle space. The patent doesn't suggest that Amazon plans to sell self-driving cars through Prime. (Imagine having a new car delivered to your door autonomously.) Nor will it enter the ride-sharing market to compete against Uber, or produce technology that goes into self-driving cars, like Google's latest autonomous vehicle pivot. Instead the patent, titled "Lane Assignments for Autonomous Vehicles," reveals a bigger-picture play that fits with Amazon's business strategy to deliver goods more efficiently. In particular, it provides a way to communicate with self-driving vehicles so they can adjust to changes in traffic flow when navigating what's known as reversible lanes that switch direction depending on the volume of the traffic flow and are often used to manage vehicle travel in and out of urban areas. The patent, which was originally filed in November 2015 but granted earlier this week, notes that autonomous vehicles "may not have information about reversible lanes when approaching a portion of a roadway" that uses them. And it provides a glimpse of why Amazon would want to control traffic patterns as they relate to self-driving cars. Anticipating Reversible Lanes There's the obvious safety benefit of having self-driving cars—or in Amazon's case, autonomous delivery trucks and vans—not driving the wrong way in traffic and causing a head-on collision. But not being able to anticipate reversible lanes also means delivery trucks can't optimize their routes in advance, which means they'll spend more time in traffic, something Amazon wants to avoid. Related Driverless Cars: When the Internet Takes the Wheel Driverless Cars: When the Internet Takes the Wheel The patent doesn't reveal much about Amazon's own plans to develop self-driving vehicles. But it's not a stretch to imagine that autonomous vehicles could be an essential part of the Amazon Logistics division, which it launched in 2012 to take more direct control of its delivery network. And self-driving delivery trucks and vans would be a natural extension to Amazon's purchase of robotics firm Kiva Systems in 2012, which helped it automate its distribution centers. Another interesting twist is that the division of Amazon leading its autonomous-vehicle research is its drone project, Prime Air. And one of the inventors listed on the patent, Jim Curlander, is a technical adviser at Prime Air. It's easy to put the pieces together based on the recent Amazon patent and see it as a way for self-driving trucks to move goods more efficiently to consumers—and eventually eliminate delivery drivers. But I believe there's something larger at play here. When Amazon has entered markets such as streaming content or cloud services, the online retail giant has made a significant impact. With this patent, Amazon is not only extending its influence to self-driving technology and to the delivery business, but how traffic moves in and out of cities—and to the control of self-driving cars.

 Microsoft wants to make it easier to use Cortana during a phone call Shona Ghosh Jan. 18, 2017, 5:50 AM 1,901 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images One limitation with voice assistants like Microsoft's Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri, is that they aren't great for multitasking. You can't launch Google Assistant by voice while using an app, for example. And most iPhone users can only activate Siri by voice if their phone is plugged in. But Microsoft appears to be working on ways to make Cortana more useful while the user is doing other things. A recently published patent filing from Microsoft details how someone could launch Cortana with a voice command while in the middle of a phone call or any other activity on the device. Specifically, a user might be on a call talking about a new game. The new feature detailed in the patent would let that person activate Cortana by voice while actually on the call, then get her to open a webpage with more information on the game. A diagram from Microsoft's patent filing.Microsoft/USPTO The feature would still be slightly limited. Microsoft's filing suggests the user would first need to choose specific web pages and then "pin" them to their device's home screen. Cortana would only be able to open these web pages, and she wouldn't be able to do anything else.  But you could use the feature while doing anything else on the device. That includes browsing the web, watching YouTube or listening to music, as well as making a call.  Microsoft also suggests the user could enable a "reading mode" which means they never have to look at their phone at all. The browser would support text-to-speech functionality, meaning you could be out on a run listening to music, ask Cortana to launch a web page, and then get her to read the page out to you. As the filing notes: "The reading mode can be expected to be advantageous in many applications as it provides users with a way to interact with the mobile device 110 and consume content without having to read it." Technology companies like Microsoft patent lots of different ideas and devices, but only a handful of them actually make it to production. Just because Microsoft has patented this new version of Cortana doesn't mean it's going to come to phones any time soon.

Opinion/Analysis Naman Nepal @bloggermonk January 20, 2017 2:20 pm 0 Shares Google built a multi-billion dollar business based on its ability to weigh site authority. Search and autocomplete are so seamlessly intuitive that most of us couldn’t imagine using the web any other way. But some groups have been tricking the system to boost misinformation in search rankings. And we all know how that turned out. The problem seems to be that Google’s search algorithm is designed to find and promote what’s popular online. While this works well to promote a popular local service (like barber shops and restaurants), it’s not really helpful when it comes to disseminating news. The algorithm seems to be promoting information that is simple not true. If you don’t think so, trying doing a search for “climate change is…” and see what you come up with. Google isn’t the only tech company to face increased scrutiny over the way its algorithms work. Facebook faced similar criticism earlier when the public realized its role in helping misinformation spread during the 2016 US presidential campaign. The social media giant has been accused of unknowingly helping build support for websites that are filled with misinformation. Meanwhile, communication experts and data scientists claim some groups have found creative ways to manipulate social media trends. Neither Google nor Facebook has made their search algorithms public. In the past, when research groups found weaknesses in the algorithmic search system, Google could adjust the system manually. But this process has never been transparent and the company has never before been held accountable for a bias in the system. These manipulations could have an impact on the way searchers perceive the world around them. Constant exposure to fake news influences the way people think about social issues and even play a role in the way they vote. Researchers from the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology found that undecided voters could be greatly influenced by manipulating search rankings. In other words, Google and other tech giants that control search engines could have the power to rig an election. After the update on Google’s search algorithm last year, fake news sites are increasingly outranking accurate reports on high-quality websites. This is due to the algorithm’s inclination to reward search results based on the user’s likeliness to click on them. Because of this, Google’s-autocomplete suggestions now predict that you are searching for fake news even when you might not intend to do so. There has also been a widespread misconception that the spread of fake news is all Facebook’s fault. However, social shares, likes, and tweets don’t account for Google’s ranking algorithm. It’s true that fake news has emerged as a serious problem on Facebook recently, but that problem and Google algorithm’s higher ranking of fake news results are separate problems. Google admits that its autocomplete and search algorithms are not an ‘exact science.’ These systems are a combination of personalized search results and a variety of secret factors that are used to weigh a website’s importance. The company has made efforts in the past to reduce the way these systems weigh porn, hate speech, and offensive terms. The heated debate around fake news has already pushed Facebook to improve its algorithm. Hopefully, Google will follow suit soon.

This year's CES showed where we can expect the tech to head in 2017, extending well beyond the range of internet-connected fridges that first popped up several years ago. Basically any device that is powered by electricity is now able to be controlled via a variety of home automation systems, and these ranged from the absolutely useful to the utterly useless. Once again Amazon's Alexa system took centre stage, with most companies relying upon Amazon Echo as the central hub to control their devices. It's no wonder, considering over 5 million of these units had sold by the end of 2016. Sadly it's still not available Down Under –perhaps our Aussie twang is too hard to decipher for Amazon's powerful server farms. However, Apple's increasingly popular HomeKit smart system – based on its Siri voice technology – had a much stronger presence this year. Unfortunately Google's Home system didn't quite make the splash that many had expected, with fewer partners announcing support for the recently released electronic ecosystem.

The one that shone brightest was Belkin's new WeMo Dimmer kit, which is compatible with both Alexa and Google Home. Belkin's WeMo light kit has been available for almost a year already, but it could only switch lights on or off. The latest version introduces the ability to tweak the brightness to match your mood. It can even be programmed to operate at various brightness levels according to the time of the day, or as a clever way to trick crooks into thinking you're home when you're not. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Ondilo ICO floats in your pool and monitors water quality. Photo: Bennett Ring Extending automation to the garage is Hyundai's new Google Home-connected cars. You'll be able to program the GPS from inside the house, and even fire up the engine with a simple voice command. Amazon has partnered with Ford instead, with its SYNC 3 system offering similar features. Most importantly, it also works with Aussie accents, with a localised version available Down Under. Connected fridges have been around for several years now, but Samsung's new Family Hub Fridge brings a couple of cool new features to the kitchen. An Australian partnership with Woolworths means shoppers can plug their order onto the fridge's 21-inch touchscreen and have it delivered the next day. There's even cameras inside so you can check what needs replacing via your mobile while you're doing the shopping the old-fashioned way. The company also unveiled the v2.0 prototype of the fridge, which brings voice activation – perfect for reading recipe instructions without getting your greasy fingers all over the screen. Advertisement To help lower water costs,  Hydrao smart showerhead uses an LED light system to show exactly how much water is being used, while real-time monitoring allows the user to adjust flow rate. It can even calculate exactly how much energy you're burning through during a long, hot shower. An emerging area of home automation is healthcare products, with a range of gadgets designed to keep you and your family alive and kicking. The Avent uGrow "digital parenting platform" from Philips is far more than a simple camera and microphone baby-monitoring system, as optional extras include a heart rate monitor, humidifier and digital thermometer.

Don't fancy a trip to the dentist? Prophix by Onvi is a smart toothbrush that has a video camera and torch aimed directly at your teeth. Not only does it show problem spots, it will send photos directly to your dentist, allowing them to diagnose problem spots before the need for a drill. Getting down and dirty is the Body Care smart toilet, which monitors how often you use the toilet, and can even clean itself. Even your cat's toilet has been given the smart-treatment; Litter Robot detects when kitty has taken care of business, and automatically separates freshly deposited packages from clean litter.

Our favourite smart device of the show had to be Shadecraft Sunflower, a smart-umbrella that automatically tracks the position of the sun to ensure you're always in the shadows. Powered by solar cells on top of the shade, it also includes battery chargers for phones, as well as Bluetooth enabled speakers. These were but a few of the new connected devices to debut at the show, alongside the usual range of door-locks, video cameras and power points. Most of these won't hit Aussie shores for some time, especially considering we're still waiting for a localised version of Amazon's Alexa Echo, but they do show just how interconnected the home of the future will be ... provided you can afford it. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Know which sources are best to follow for local news and information that will be of real value to your followers. Make a habit of checking in regularly. Get Inman via Facebook Messenger Our top headlines delivered once a day. by CareyBot Are you struggling to find information to share on your Facebook business page? Beyond doing the dirty hands-on work of interviewing local school principals and reviewing dishes from every restaurant in town, how can you keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening so that your Facebook followers hear it from you first? Download the right mobile apps, set up a few simple email alerts and you can keep an eye on local news in just minutes a day. From transportation to development plans to new restaurants, if it’s important in your community, find out who’s talking about it and follow the conversation. Over time, you’ll get a feel for where the news is coming from and all you’ll need to do is scan your sources regularly. Content sources Twitter With only a few characters per post, Twitter is quick and easy to scan. Choose some good sources of local content and over time Twitter will offer up more suggestions. I recommend starting with these Twitter feeds from within your community: Your local Business Journal publication (or find more by Googling your city name followed by “business news”) Chamber of commerce/downtown association High school sports, music and theater feeds Prep sports writers from local papers Local sheriff or police department Business writer or business section from the local newspaper Construction trade sites Favorite local shopping centers Popular restaurants Google Alerts Set up a Google Alert, and Google will search the web for content related to key terms you provide and send you a daily digest of where those terms have appeared online. Simply go to Google.com/alerts, and enter the terms you’d like to follow. Terms to ask Google to keep you up-to-date on should include: Your city name Neighborhood name(s) Local housing developments Your city name plus the word development in quotes (i.e. “Sacramento development”) “[Your city name] restaurant opening” Specific types of housing you might specialize in, like “Seattle condos” Names of major local shopping centers (if it’s a common name you may need to include the city name after it) You can then tell Google how often to send you an email recap — I recommend once a day. Feedly Feedly is a news aggregator or curation hive that provides an efficient way to follow local blogs or websites. Go to Feedly.com and sign in using your Google or Facebook account, or create a unique Feedly account. Once logged in, click on the “website” tab and enter the URL of the site you’d like to follow. Then simply click the “follow” button to have it added to your curated list. Good sources include: Your local Patch site (visit patch.com to see if there’s one for your community) Your local Eater (visit eater.com to see if your city is covered) Local food writers City lifestyle magazines Small community newspapers Business/real estate writers City government Chamber of commerce/downtown association Typing your community name into the search box on Feedly will also bring up a variety of different news feeds to consider, or try Googling the name of your city followed by the word “blogs.” Nextdoor Assuming you live in the community you serve, you should already be on Nextdoor. The private Nextdoor group for your neighborhood offers the ultimate in hyperlocal content, and is a fantastic way to keep up with what people are talking about. Neighbors complaining about the confusing new bus routes near home, or concerned about the local restaurant that suddenly closed? Find out what’s going on and share it on your Facebook business page. You can then reply to the question on Nextdoor and refer people to your Facebook page for more information. Just remember that your No. 1 job on Nextdoor is to be a good neighbor. Simply set Nextdoor up to send you a daily recap of posts by email, and this should be enough to keep up to date. Keeping on top of it all Now that you have your content sources set up, all you need to do is create a habit of checking them. Download the Twitter and Feedly apps to your smartphone and time the emails from Nextdoor and Google Alerts to arrive at a time that’s convenient for you. I start my day by quickly checking my sources while on the Stairmaster in the mornings, once again during my afternoon commute, and again in front of the TV in the evening. Just find a schedule that works for you, build a habit and stick with it. Over time people will wonder how you seem to know everything that’s going on in town!

SOUND cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’..

Q & A: Music Downloader Free Apps In case you are unsure about a few things related to downloading music onto your many devices, this post will hopefully clarify a few things for you. This section will explain everything from music downloads, to music apps, legal music downloads, and more. (Please note: in regards to illegal downloads, we advocate nothing. The following information is gathered from sources across the internet. The risk and consequence is entirely your own). How do you download a song from YouTube to your computer? If you have never heard of a YouTube converter, now is the best time to start using one. YouTube converters are free to use and take only a matter of seconds to use.

As mentioned above, YouTube converter websites are the best way to go. So, what exactly do they do and how to use them? The whole premise is simple. A YouTube converter snatches an audio track from a music video. It then allows you to download and keep this audio track. In order to do this, choose a reliable YouTube converter website and copy and paste the video link.

This is a very broad question which may require a lengthy answer. In its simplest form, a download is a file which has been shared from another computer to your own computer (or device). Like giving an item to another person, a download is essentially like a computer giving an item to another computer. Files come in many forms. Some files are as tiny as a few bytes, whereas some are as huge as a few gigabytes.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business Alphabet’s portfolio of innovative projects could pay off over long term SUNDAY, JAN. 22, 2017 The Motley Fool Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS In August 2015, the company formerly known as Google changed its name and corporate structure to better reflect its business model and strategy. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL, GOOG) is now a collection of businesses of which Google is the largest and most important contributor in terms of sales and earnings. Its “Other Bets” segment includes projects and businesses such as Fiber, Nest, self-driving cars, Google X, and health-care ventures such as Calico and Verily, among others. Google leads the online advertising field, with one of the most valuable brands in the world. It has seven platforms with more than 1 billion monthly users: Google Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play and Gmail. The more Alphabet grows, the more information it collects from users, helping it improve the quality of its services and offer more effective ads. Alphabet’s “Other Bets” include several businesses with little economic promise in the short term. However, the diversified portfolio of innovative projects could pay off well for investors over the long term. After all, YouTube seemed like a moon-shot project a decade ago, and now, on mobile alone, it reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds in the U.S. than any TV network, including both broadcast and cable TV. (Alphabet executive Suzanne Frey is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors. The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Alphabet.) Ask the Fool Q: When I buy a share of stock in a company, does it get the money? And what does owning some shares really get me? – K.R., Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania A: Shares of stock represent real ownership stakes in companies. If a company has a million shares outstanding and you buy 100 of them, you own one ten-thousandth of the company. As the company grows more valuable, so should your shares. Companies that “go public” via initial public offerings (IPOs) collect most of the cash generated when shares are created and initially sold. But once the shares start trading on the market between investors, the company doesn’t get a piece of those transactions. (Brokerages do, though.) Still, companies care how their stocks do. A falling stock price lowers a business’s market value and can make it easier for it to get bought out. A rising stock price can help insiders with stock or stock options get richer, and it can help the company buy another company with stock, costing it fewer shares. Q: What are “Freddie Mac” and “Fannie Mae,” and what do they do? – H.W., Abilene, Texas A: Originally known as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., and respectively created in 1938 and 1970, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that support affordable homeownership and rental housing in America by making mortgage money available. Instead of actually loaning money, they operate in the secondary market, buying and guaranteeing qualifying mortgages from lenders so lenders can turn around and lend more money to more borrowers. The GSEs then package together bundles of loans and “securitize” them as “mortgage-backed securities” so they can be sold and traded. My dumbest investment My dumbest mistake was buying shares of Solar City at $60 and watching them plummet. Thanks, Motley Fool, for some great investment advice! – L.C., online The Fool responds: You’re right that Solar City was one of the stocks recommended in our investment newsletters – and it burned us, too, dropping some 65 percent from when we recommended it in our Motley Fool Rule Breakers portfolio to when we issued a “sell” recommendation in November 2016. It’s a simple truth that not all of even the best investors’ ideas will prove profitable. Overall, Rule Breakers recommendations have significantly outperformed the S&P 500. So what went wrong with Solar City? Well, one problem was its business model, which featured leasing solar equipment and accumulating a lot of debt on its balance sheet. Rising expenses didn’t help the unprofitable company, either. The struggling company was recently bought by the electric car company Tesla. It’s worth remembering that even savvy investors won’t always agree on the merits of various investments. At the time of this writing, three of our investing newsletters recommended buying shares of Tesla, while two recommended selling. Tesla has a lot going for it, such as robust sales growth, but it faces increasing competition, it’s carrying a lot of debt, and its valuation seems steep. Some have lost their faith in Tesla because of the Solar City acquisition, in part due to Tesla founder Elon Musk’s ties to the company.

Both companies – or in Google’s case, its parent group, Alphabet – are therefore expected to announce booming revenues in their fourth-quarter results over the next fortnight, with Alphabet going first on Thursday and Amazon the following week. But analysts are already looking beyond the simple question of how many cardboard boxes Amazon filled and how many searches Google answered. They’re wondering which company will win the battle to control your home. That battle is being fought by two carafe-sized cylinders from the respective companies. One is Amazon’s Echo, with its voice-operated “personal assistant”, Alexa; the other is Google Home, which responds to the phrase “OK Google”. Both are internet-connected, home-based devices which can be command to do things: give the weather forecast; play music; read out news headlines; update shopping lists; and control “smart” devices in the home such as light bulbs or power points. In theory, if a device can be linked to it, the Echo can control or monitor it, and keep you informed. And simply by saying “Alexa, add sugar to the shopping list”, users can keep up to date on house supplies and even purchase them directly. Amazon is in the lead, having launched the Echo in November 2014, two years before Google Home came out. Though Amazon has not – and does not – release sales figures for any individual item, investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that 11m Echos had been sold by the end of November 2016; other estimates suggest a further 7m have been sold since. About 700,000 were estimated to have been sold in the UK and Germany, the only countries outside the US where it is available. The Morgan Stanley estimate would put an Echo in more than 8% of US households. This is a significant figure, especially compared with the best estimates for Google Home, which put its sales at less than a million since its launch in October 2016. Why should Google care about Amazon? Because voice is seen as the next big field for computer interaction, and the home is a far better environment for voice detection than the great outdoors. Research company Gartner reckons that by 2018, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type, and the technology behind voice interaction is improving all the time. The risk to Google is that at the moment, almost everyone starting a general search at home begins at Google’s home page on a PC or phone. That leads to a results page topped by text adverts – which help generate about 90% of Google’s revenue, and probably more of its profits. But if people begin searching or ordering goods via an Echo, bypassing Google, that ad revenue will fall. And Google has cause to be uncomfortable. The shift from desktop to mobile saw the average number of searches per person fall as people moved to dedicated apps; Google responded by adding more ads to both desktop and search pages, juicing revenues. A shift that cut out the desktop in favour of voice-oriented search, or no search at all, would imperil its lucrative revenue stream. Amazon is copying one feature of Google’s success in smartphones: it is offering methods to connect and control smart devices via the Echo for free, rather as Google’s Android software was offered as a free platform for smartphones. There are signs it is paying off: Wynn hotels in Las Vegas announced in December that it would be adding Echos to all 5,000 rooms, for functions such as playing music and controlling curtains and blinds. That gained some notice, as much as anything because the life cycle of such hotels implies they will be there for a decade or so. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Amazon’s Echo: providing a handy link to the firm’s shopping services. Photograph: Mikael Buck/Rex Similarly, at January’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), also in Las Vegas, commentators were struck by how many devices incorporated Alexa. And Amazon is even stealing into Google’s territory: some phones sold in the US from China’s Huawei, which uses Android, will incorporate Alexa rather than Google’s Assistant programme. Google’s natural reaction is to have its own voice-driven home system, in Home. But that poses a difficulty, illustrated by the problems it claims to solve. At the device’s launch, one presenter from the company explained how it could speak the answer to questions such as “how do you get wine stains out of a rug?” Most people would pose that question on a PC or mobile, and the results page would offer a series of paid-for ads. On Home, you just get the answer – without ads. What analysts wonder is: how can Home bridge that revenue gap? So far, Google hasn’t explained. Even if it can fend off the Echo, it may not be able to defend its core business. By contrast, the Echo’s benefit to Amazon is much clearer: it can make online shopping (at Amazon) a breeze, play music from Amazon’s paid-for subscription service, and generally act as a passive block on your using rival shopping sites – rather as Google cemented its dominance by being the default search engine on multiple browsers in the mid-2000s. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research suggests that time is running out for Google: “It has to act quickly, as Amazon is on the brink of becoming the industry standard for controlling smart home devices. “At CES, everyone was integrating with Echo, with Google Home and Apple HomeKit barely present.” Indeed, where are Apple and Microsoft, which also have their own voice-driven assistants in the form of Siri and Cortana? Although both can be used in the home – Siri on the iPhone or iPad, and to play content on the Apple TV set-top box, and Cortana on the Xbox games console – neither seems to be intent on the “home assistant” market. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice-president of marketing, seemed to suggest recently that Apple wouldn’t follow Amazon and Google into offering a voice-only device: “Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” He also emphasised the importance of a visual display: “We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.” Even so, there are persistent rumours that Apple has prototyped an Echo-like device in secret but is undecided on whether to release it. The company hasn’t commented. It could be ready to unveil something – or may never do so. Microsoft, meanwhile, is in more homes than the Echo via the Xbox, but isn’t trying to make itself a listening device linked to a shop. So, will we all be burbling away to thin air in a few years, asking how long our commute will take while our smartphones sit unused in the kitchen? Perhaps – though Ken Sena, a senior analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, suggests that home-based voice assistants will never be used as widely as smartphones. According to Sena, they are not such a must-have. Yet, they were a hot Christmas present – and voice interaction is still in its early days, perhaps comparable to the smartphone market in 2005, when BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft dominated. Or, it could be like the smartphone market now, effectively dominated by Google and Apple. But which? Alexa, can you see into the future?

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile CEO John Legere makes his predictions for 2017 T-Mobile CEO John Legere makes his predictions for 2017 January 6, 2017 Alex Wagner 54 Comments It’s the start of a new year, and just like he has the past couple of years, T-Mobile CEO John Legere has laid out his predictions for the coming 12 months. Legere’s first prediction for 2017 is that cable companies will try to enter wireless through MVNO deals, but that they’ll fail. Legere adds that because of this, T-Mobile will not get into any MVNO deals with cable companies. Cable companies are the only ones that’ll try to get into wireless in 2017, Legere suggests, as he thinks that “a MAJOR new player will jump in and shake up US wireless in a MAJOR way.” The T-Mo CEO specifically guesses that Google will “go for the mobile moonshot.” Google offers wireless service through Project Fi, which runs on the T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular networks, but Legere appears to think that Google will take things a step farther in 2017. Sticking with the topic of other companies, Legere thinks that Dish will be no more this year after it missed its opportunity to enter wireless using its supply of spectrum. Moving on to television shows, Legere predicts that the majority of TV watching will happen on mobile by the end of 2017. More than one-third of TV viewing happens on something other than a TV, Legere says, with that number jumping to 50 percent for people under 25. And T-Mo’s CEO expects those numbers to continue to grow. The second TV-related prediction from Legere is that content built for OTT and mobile consumption, like his Slow Cooker Sunday show, will pass cable channels in number of viewers. Specifically, Legere thinks that his Slow Cooker Sunday show will get a weekly audience of 1 million viewers by the end of 2017. The show currently pulls in more than 500,000 viewers each week. Rounding out John’s 2017 predictions are gigabit LTE speeds, which T-Mobile touts that it’s nearly achieved in lab testing; a wireless CEO shuffle that’ll see three of the four current CEOs exiting their positions this year; and merger discussions between Verizon and Comcast as a way to help Comcast get into wireless. While John didn’t make any specific predictions about T-Mobile’s network, it seems likely that T-Mo will continue to build out its LTE coverage in 2017. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said yesterday that T-Mo plans to cover 320 million POPs with LTE in 2017, up from the 313 million covered at the end of 2016. Ray also said that T-Mobile currently reaches 251 million people with its Extended Range LTE coverage and that that number will grow in the first half of 2017. So what do you think of all these predictions? Do you have any that you’d like to add?

The prospect of that being the year end coverage map is so very exciting! Mark Kendrick I’m amazed myself by the improvement in their network in just the last year. I tried TMO last year for a couple of months but bailed because the service wasn’t very good, a year later and I’m quite satisfied Edward Ward Over the past year I have seen my coverage improve tremendously, to the point where I now have coverage on par with my wife who is Verizon loyal. Jason Caprio Those are some nice coverage predictions. I’ll believe it when I see it. I hope to see the day when T-Mobile ties/beats Verizon in rootmetrics, then I’ll switch back! I’m rooting for T-Mobile all the way! Cellphone Chris The cable MVNO thing isn’t a prediction, it’s already been announced. Those that know what I’m talking about understand that a merger between Verizon and Comcast seems highly unlikely. a d00d With Republicans in control of all 3 houses (Capitol Hill House, Senate, and White House), this merger is very much a possibility. In fact, depending on how fast they change things, I could even call it certain. Evil attracts Evil, after all. And I wonder how many board members are shared? Of course, we’ll all suffer for it, along with a TMo merger, but that’s the way it goes. At least we should be rid of Obamacare… Acdc1a We have no idea what is to come. A Republican wasn’t elected President, a populist was. If popular opinion is against the idea, it doesn’t go through. If it’s well sold to the public, it will. Linx I can’t see myself on any other carrier than T-Mobile right now. Richard Roma That’s interesting, I’m on the opposite end where I feel like evaluating other options. I don’t like this One only push at all. Jay Holm This coming April I will have been with T-Mobile for 4 full years. Very happy customer. Walt Get ride of the 3G hspa and use that spectrum for LTE. Keep 2G edge for all the flip phones and m2m Andrew Singleton keeping any 2g is a horrible idea. tmo’s new flip phone is LTE. a d00d Andrew, you need to re-read about IoT in the article earlier in the week. Walt, the problem is that many of the IoT resellers have been nudging these guys onto 3G as a cheaper measure than going directly to LTE as most companies only think of the short haul (bottom line for this quarter or year only) versus the long haul (let someone else pay for it). Plus there are a huge number of 3G handsets still in use, especially from other, poorer countries or rural carriers in this one who refuse to upgrade, likely because they can’t afford it. 2G will be with us a few more years, and 3G probably until the mid 2020’s at the earliest. Then again, with some of the fancy on-the-fly spectrum shuffling these new software-defined radio systems can do, it has been pointed out by others that, at least in an advanced network like TMo’s, they may NEVER go away completely! Andrew Singleton i guess i always assumed that IoT would prefer to use a sliver of a much wider LTE band than take full advantage of a 2g band for universality purposes. i work in the northern colorado market where t-mobile completely refarmed 1900mhz and caused thousands of peoples phones to work in about 12 the places they used to. they had a pilot program to assist in the exchange of devices for a while and many flip phone users were not happy! Nobody Special I predict after January 22nd @ The deadline for simple choice subscribers to switch to t-mobile one and get the tax included deal …. t-mobile will come up with a new incentive to trick the remaining simple choice subscribers to come to the darkside “T-Mobile One”…. the saga continues. nearvanaman I sort of rolled my eyes at T-Mo One because I typically use 1.5 to 3.0 gigs a month. But my 6GB plan, with taxes, costs me $75 a month. This “new” T-Mo One incentive will cost me a maximum of $70 and, sometimes, $60. I know the point is to get people on to the One plan and it’s hard to see a downside of doing this if they are never going to offer tiered plans again. Acdc1a For you it’s a no-brainer. I have 5 lines on ONE and Leger is right, it’s nice not to try to count GB. AJ2 What Tmo has failed to realize with the Tmo One plans is that most people still use 2gb or less. The $10 ‘back’ is a nice marekting ploy that I guess will make the plan a $60. If you use a Nexus or Pixel, Project Fi would still be cheaper. I see all these ads for $40 a line but thats only if you buy 4 lines. If they’d offer something for single customers, Id give Tmobile a try again as its the only one of the big 4 Ive ever had before switching to MVNOs. I dont care about a free Subway sandwich or some coupon to a product Idont want. If you can give a family of 4 free lines, you surely can do a promotion to offer single people a break Jay Holm If all people use is 2GB’s or less, what is the point in have a $500-$700+ smartphone? That’s like having a $20k car and driving lessons than 20 miles total per day, if I go no where but to work and back home that would be nearly 26 miles total in one day. I just don’t understand what the purpose is having a $500-$700 device and only use a measly 2gigs in a 30 day period. TJ Ninneman It’s called Wi-Fi. There is Wifi coverage almost everywhere these days. Jay Holm Are you blind to the fact that wifi is SECURED nearly everywhere??? TJ Ninneman Not in my area. Honestly just about every bar, restaurant and grocery/department store has it. John Doe I don’t think Dish will end in 2017. They have Sling TV and Charlie Ergen isn’t a stupid guy so maybe I doubt it will disappear in 2017 that is too soon. I think John hopes that Dish will disappear so he can get his hands on their spectrum LoL (Oh that is right they have spectrum they can sell if things get bad for Dish) a d00d I don’t know if it was a mis-quote or not as I didn’t watch the video or whatever, but I think he meant Dish as a potential wireless competitor. The FCC has repeatedly warned them that they have never complied with their rules regarding build-out time after purchasing spectrum. That is, Dish is a Spectrum Squatter, the wireless version of a Domain Squatter, and, even under a new right-wing admin, I think the FCC may have finally had enough. Consider they let Globalstar use their little block of spectrum for limited terrestrial use after they’ve been begging for years. OTOH, Ergen has been squatting on a boat-load of spectrum with no network for years despite FCC pressure to sell or build. I for one truly hope that the FCC finally drops the hammer. QWR At CES, Legere actually said something to the effect that delivery of satellite-based content is dead, and so Dish will be dead as well. IMO he was not talking about Dish as a wireless provider. As far as the FCC goes, they have very little interest in going after Ergen for squatting since they turned him down for buying anyone on the cheap in 2015. He attempted to put it to use, and has until sometime this year to sell or lease 50% of his spectrum, even though it’s transmission properties are more suited for large amounts of data vs. speed. BadBatz 1. How about “predicting” some bonuses, freebies, incentives, etc. for long time subscribers to T-Mobile… The siren song of AT&T is calling… And Project Fi is taking already a lot of my business away from T-Mob… 2. Bandwidth… Need more bandwidth… How about more bandwidth… No more bandwidth, no more wireless watching of anything, Mr. Legere. And rural coverage… 3. Please, Mr. Legere, “predict” better international coverage for “free data roaming” and 20 cent voice calls. Some initiatives notwithstanding (Europe higher speed data for example) international roaming has become a sad joke: data throttled to the point of being unusable (64 kbps in may places), inability to dial out to many countries whilst roaming, etc. Even the T-Mobile app no workee in may places… Please “predict” improvements or just “predict” going back to the sate of int’l roaming from 2015… marque2 Project To always seemed really expensive to me. $10 per gig, wow. AJ2 Id switch to Tmobile if it had a less expensive plan for single customers, especially people that dont use 10-20 gb of data. Left Tmo years ago – First went to Straight Talk for their $45 5gb LTE plan and now on Fi where my bills are tiny. If Im not mistaken, with their new $10 rebate, the lowest plan is $60 if you use less than 2gb. Even getting paid $150 to switch doesnt make it worth it. Expert go with tmobile prepaid BadBatz If you don’t use gobs of data stay with Fi. For email, news, maps/navigation, etc. my total monthly bill is seldom over $30. Fi prefers T-Mobile anyway, even whilst roaming abroad the US endpoint is a T-Mobile IP in Texas, but connects to other networks stateside if T-Mobile is not available. Besides, laptop tethering doesn’t cost extra, roaming data is at full speed and it roams in some countries where T-Mobile does not. And Fi forwards calls AND text messages – the latter priceless if you use multiple phones. I have no idea what will become of Project Fi but for now I’m happy to have “Google talk” in my pocket :-) marque2 T-Mobile offered full speed tethering with its older plans. And I believe low speed tethering is included in Europe. Europe is way behind going to LTE, so high speed is also.lst impossible anyway. Jay Holm Since you use “so little data”, why even have a smartphone? Seriously! What a waste of money for someone who doesn’t even use their smartphone! marque2 Agreed, he can get a flip phone and 350 minutes of monthly service for $9 a month. TJ Ninneman Wifi is everywhere. I think just about every bar, restaurant and department store in my area has it. You can get by with very little data usage if you don’t constantly pull out your phone while driving. Jay Holm Your one of those idiots who thinks people should pay for something and not use it. Why do any of you even have a smartphone that cost $500/ $600/ $700+ and barely even use it? Seriously these things cost so much money, I like to use things that cost a lot of money. TJ Ninneman Huh? You can still use a smartphone to it’s full potential and not use a ton of data MOBILE data. The data on wifi is just as good as mobile data, just a lot cheaper. The point is that if you live most of your life on wifi (whether at home, work or out-and-about), why pay for mobile data that you do not use? Aleks I always knew that Google would enter the fray with a wireless service of their own. For John Legere to make this prediction, tells me that Google and T-Mobile could be looking at a merger, which to me, is the whole purpose of Google entering the wireless business sector. It’s been discussed behind closed doors. If this indeed does happen, look for wireless to be much cheaper and faster as Google is known to keep things affordable for the masses. Don’t take my word for it but if you’re on a legacy T-Mobile plan right now and ggrandfathered in, consider yourself lucky as they will be a major player in the wireless industry for the foreseeable future. I’m looking at Google and T-Mobile to work together and pave the way for the future. But like I said, don’t take my word for it. Just see it happening from a business standpoint. marque2 Google is evil. It will be a sad day when they take over TM. Nearmsp I would like to know what percentage of interstate freeways and state highways are covered rather than the million population. We just do not talk when we are in population centers. We talk while get from point A to point B and we could travel through places with no population on the way out of one city to another. This is the reason why people go for AT&T and Verizon. Coverage outside of major cities should be a goal of T-mobile. Currently I carry a a Verizon myfi and switch on as soon as leave the metro area to be able to do wi-fi calling. T-mobile coverage outside cities still sucks. It has improved much but a long way to go. KeepU You don’t happen to do much of that rural driving in West Virginia or between I-35 and I-5 do you? I drive a truck, and those are the only places I find a big difference in coverage between my t-mobile and verizon coverage. marque2 He doesn’t do much rural driving in his apparent state of Texas. Or never uses the phone while driving. Jay Holm I’ve driven from Houston to Laredo, from Houston to Dallas, from Houston to Longview. . .never lost signal in between any of these places. marque2 Try Midland to El Paso. No coverage for 200 miles when I last drove it. Try driving I-40 in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. I have a fairly new 5x as well. Parts of I15 in CA. Shouldn’t have problems with the new bands. And once the interstates are covered major highways should be next 395 and 78 “Ortega highway” comes to mind. I know TM is small and is trying hard to cover more, bit to claim no issues while travelling is false. Also note San Diego has major holes in Oceanside, Carlsbad, parts of Coronado and San Diego bay. They haven’t put Band 12 in San Diego yet. Joe I agree. In TMobile’s home state of Washington, there is not even coverage across all three major mountain passes. These are areas, especially in the winter that need coverage. KeepU I predict the low grade billing fraud will continue, as will the network build out, and despite it’s serious flaws T-mobile will continue to be the least bad of the major wireless providers. QWR Nice hat. Did you get a free bowl of soup with it? And Dish would like to officially declare that you cut your hair this year. Steven Prediction, T-Mobile will continue to ignore the Alabama and Florida Gulf Coast by not issuing the much needed Extended Range LTE. Something’s got to give man zom Maybe because the majority of the Alabama Florida gulf coast is in channel 51 area? http://maps.spectrumgateway.com/t-mobile-700-mhz-spectrum.html Steven Nah, that’s hardly the majority. That channel 51 area only covers basically Panama City up to the state line, From Miramar Beach all the way west to Gulf Port, MS, no channel 51 issues, wide open, and ignored. Same from Apalachicola all the way east and around to Gainesville is free from channel 51 and available for Band 12. The protected area you are talking about is not a large portion of the area at all and should not hinder the majority of the Gulf Coast. Joe Merger Merger with Sprint in 2017 ryannnz Not in predictions: T-Mobile indoor coverage Tom Lol, smh Joe That my coverage will not improve this year Joe Verizon is making a run at my business lines. The rep thinks he can get fairly close in pricing, that coupled with much better coverage may cause me to jump.

For those that have the need for speed, here we’ll be sharing 10 of our favorite racing games on Android. These are the best available in 2016. Playing games on our Android smartphones and tablets is becoming increasingly more popular thanks to a huge selection. Not to mention big HD displays and powerful processors inside devices like the Galaxy S7 or Google Pixel. Racing games are extremely popular but it can be hard to find the good ones. Read: 10 Best First Person Shooter Games for Android Whether you’re looking for ultra realistic racing, casual arcade fun, or want to be flying through water with turbo boosts and more, we have it all covered. Here we highlight some of the better looking games available. These are fun, free, or at least worth spending your hard earned money on. Over the past year or two Android games have improved by leaps and bounds, and are getting better with each release. Not to mention Android 7.0 Nougat and its new Vulcan gaming API promises to deliver a whole new level of quality. The games detailed below will keep you busy for hours, and on the edge of your seat. We’re starting with Asphalt 8: Airborne, as it’s still my favorite all-around game on Android. Well, unless you consider Clash of Clans. Then take a peek at the slideshow below for nine other great games that made our list. As we said above, there are hundreds and hundreds of games available from the Google Play Store. And while some are decent, many of them are poor copies of others and not worth the time it’ll take to download. So instead of wasting time and data, or your money, check out this list of some of the most popular racing games available on Android right now. Many are from 2015, but more are coming soon. Asphalt 8: Airborne   1 / 10 Our first pick and still my favorite racing game to date comes from Gameloft, who has now released over eight versions of their flagship racing game for Android. Asphalt 8: Airborne does away with all the simulator realism and goes for high speeds, octane boosters, and flying down realistic streets with natural lighting, shadows, and reflections all while trying to get the most air as possible going over jumps and taking shortcuts. All of this is done while having some of the best graphics on a mobile device. Asphalt 8 delivers realistic crashes and extensive vehicle damage, it has both arcade and multiplayer modes, and the career mode will have you build up a reputation, and earn additional cars for the garage. This has been my favorite game since its release, and Asphalt 7 is still a close second. It's my go-to mobile game to show off how far mobile gaming has come, and will continue to be one of my favorites that is on every tablet or smartphone I own. There is no Asphalt 9 yet, but instead you can try Asphalt Overdrive, which is more of an endless racer. It isn't quite as fun, but still worth consideration. We're hoping for an Asphalt 9 in 2017. Those with an older device that can't play Asphalt 8, download Asphalt Nitro. It's made for budget devices. Another good option is a game called City Racer. Download from Google Play Asphalt Xtreme was just released in November, and is the same racing game we all love, taken to the dirt. It's Asphalt Off-Road essentially, and loads of fun. Not to mention some of the best graphics around. Download it now.    1 / 10 27 Responses 06/10/2015 mousavian Reply thanks 12/08/2016 ateeq Reply new car racing game https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fast.car.racing.real.speed 08/06/2015 Fahad Ullah Khan Reply Nice !

The fact that high-quality games like Need For Speed Most Wanted, Rush Rally, Bangers Unlimited 2 and Colin Mc Rae were left out just for being paid, boggles the mind (especially considering the price is 1/20th of the price you need to pay to actually finish a microtransaction tarpit game) 09/13/2016 Seema Sankadecha Reply Here is another new list of Best Android Racing Games of 2016 http://www.thegreatapps.com/blog/top-ten-best-racing-games-for-android-2016-free-download-here 10/06/2016 Sillvan Reply Hii Corey you have shared a really good information, and it’s hard to find good games to play cause many people regret after installing them and get bored of it.

This device is a world’s first as it’s a Google Tango-based smartphone and today we have news of the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro price at the India launch. It’s a Flipkart exclusive and all the details are coming right up. The Lenovo Phab 2 and Phab 2 Plus were already on sale in India, and now the Phab 2 Pro has joined the lineup. One of the major points of interest with the Pro variant of the phone is its Google Tango feature using the latest Google sensors and software. This enables augmented reality and it has a unique 3D rear camera arrangement that can measure the depth of objects. This is comprised of a 16-megapixel sensor with LED flash, a fisheye camera, and depth camera. So how much does it cost? The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro price in India is Rs. 29,990 and it’s up for grabs now on Flipkart. While it was launched in other markets in Gunmetal Grey or Champagne Gold colors, only the Champagne Gold option is currently available in India. The phone has a unibody design in metal and features 2.5D curved glass as well as a fingerprint sensor placed on the rear. As far as specifications are concerned there’s plenty to admire. It has a 1.8GHz Snapdragon 652 processor and a very sizeable 6.4-inch display with Quad HD resolution of 2560 x 1440. Add to that 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD to 128GB). The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro features fast charging and a 4050 mAh battery keeps the lights on. It’s a hybrid dual SIM smartphone that runs the Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system. Connectivity includes 4G LTE, WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.0, and micro USB. Another feature is improved audio quality thanks to Dolby Atmos Capture 5.1. If you’ve been waiting for this new Lenovo smartphone to arrive, we’d like to know what you think about the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro price at its India launch?

Ads for Google’s own products appear higher than ads for third-party products on the search giant’s own websites. That’s the result of an analysis conducted by market research firm SEMrush in conjunction with The Wall Street Journal, which revealed that Google’s ads appeared prominently on its webpages a “vast majority” of the time. Ad placement is determined by a formula that ranks ads based on factors like quality, relevance to the search term, prior click rate, and its landing page. The higher the quality of the ad in question, the more likely it’ll appear on Google search results. Google product ads dominated the search giant’s webpages 91 percent of the time. The Wall Street Journal analysis, which comprised more than 25,000 searches on 25 different terms, found that Google product ads dominated the search giant’s webpages 91 percent of the time. In 43 percent of the searches, the top two ads were for Google products. Even more damning: In 99.9-percent of queries for “phones” and “smartphones” resulted in a minimum of three ads promoting the Google Pixel list above the search results. SEMrush took steps to ensure the tests accurately reflected human browsing habits. To prevent caching or tracking didn’t interfere, the firm used a desktop version of Google Search that didn’t tailor results to browsing history. And it blocked cookies, the small files on a user’s computer that store search history, site preferences, and other usage data. More: Google Pixel XL review “The results show how Google uses its dominant search engine to boost other parts of its business and give it an edge over competitors,” The Wall Street Journal reported, “which include some of its biggest advertising customers.” Google denies the allegations The ads that appear above Google search results are chosen according to an automated ad auction that the search engine conducts every fraction of a second, Google said. The auctions, which were estimated to have generated $79 billion last year, determine which ads are featured most prominently and how much advertisers pay. Google denies that it artificially boosted the visibility of its product ads. “We have consciously and carefully designed our marketing programs to not impact the ad auction,” a Google spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal. “All our bids are excluded from the auction when determining the price paid by other advertisers, and we have strict rules and processes — set to tougher levels than our customers — to govern the use of our own ads products.” But advertisers told The Wall Street Journal that Google’s ads can affect the price, placement, and performance of other firms’ ads. And they point out that a number of Google ads disappeared from search results in mid-December, after The Wall Street Journal shared its findings with the company. More: Google is spending big on its marketing campaign for the Pixel and Pixel XL The study follows a massive advertising campaign for the search giant’s branded smartphone, the Pixel. Google spent a reported $3.2 million in TV ads in the first few weeks of the phone’s availability, and some ad executives suggested that the search giant could spend hundreds of millions more. It’s likely to raise the ire of European Union regulators, who have accused Google of monopolistic search practices in the past. Last year’s EU allegations Last year, the European Union charged the Mountain View, California-based giant of “abusing its dominant position” by “systematically” promoting its own smartphones, tablets, laptops, app store, and music service, and media platforms on its properties. More: Google gets another extension to respond to EU antitrust allegations Google denied the charges. “While Google may be the most used search engine, people can now find and access information in numerous different ways — and allegations of harm, for consumers and competitors, have proved to be wide of the mark,” a spokesperson for the company said. In July, the European Commission — the institution of the EU responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, and upholding the EU treaties — announced a third round of anti-trust charges against Google. If found guilty of violating Europe competition laws, it could be on the hook for upwards of $7 billion in fines. Also watch: Share

(Photo: Romain Blanquart, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo Technology, meet art. The two collide at the Detroit Institute of Arts, which is the first museum in the world to provide a mobile tour using augmented reality. Called Lumin, a name derived from the Latin word for light, the mobile-phone-based platform was developed by the DIA in partnership with Google and mobile developer GuidiGo. A seven-stop tour will premiere to the public Wednesday for user feedback and testing. Think Pokemon Go, but for the arts. Lumin is a tool to engage with the DIA’s collection in ways not previously possible. Visitors using mobile phones provided by the DIA will be guided through the museum — and get visual and audio extras that interact with specific physical spaces on the tour. Read more: DETROIT FREE PRESS Best of the rest: More fun things to do Jan. 19-25 DETROIT FREE PRESS Oscar-worthy 'Fire at Sea' refugee doc arrives at DFT at DIA Designed for ages 8 and older, it can be especially useful for the younger generation, who will have a new bridge to old art. “This technology brings works of art to life,” said DIA director Salvador Salort-Pons. “It encourages visitors to look at works of art in the flesh.” Take, for instance, a panel of Mesopotamian reliefs that are gray to the naked eye: When viewed through Lumin, they’re filled with rich, vivid colors. “You can see that they once were painted in the past,” said Salort-Pons. “It’s difficult to visualize that. The learning experience is immediate.” Here’s how it works: Each DIA phone has Google Tango built in, which provides an augmented reality platform that doesn't need Wi-Fi or GPS. It then uses another platform, GuidiGO's AR Composer. “These technologies are motion-tracking, depth-sensing and area-learning,” said Tango senior product manager Justin Quimby. Buy Photo The Detroit Institute of Arts will soon provide a mobile tour using augmented reality which for example will allow visitors to have an x-ray view of the skeleton of an Egyptian mummy when viewed through Lumin and understand how he might have died in Detroit on Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017.  (Photo: Romain Blanquart, Detroit Free Press) Motion-tracking is the ability of the phone to know where it is as it moves through space. Visitors will hold out a Lenovo Phab2 Pro, an Android smartphone that has more sensors than a normal smartphone. “It uses a wide-angle camera to look at the environment to find features, like the intersection of a wall and the floor,” said Quimby. (That’s the depth-sensing part.) “The phone is then able to line up a digital map of the museum with the real world.” As the phone continues to move through the environment, the third and final ingredient — area-learning — comes into play. It uses this to recognize a space it has mapped before and then incorporates the augmented reality content into the real world. Sounds complicated, but the whole process works fast and easy. The phone gets going by localizing — recognizing exactly where it is — before loading up a 3D map of the precise point where you stand in the DIA, marked by a blue dot. Visitors will see the numbers 1 through 7, which indicate the seven stops of the tour. Right now, they’re only on the first floor, but the program will eventually grow to incorporate multiple tours and upward of 20-25 stops throughout all three levels. Ideally, each tour will include 10 stops that can be swapped out, said DIA director of information technology Richard Scott. It will be especially helpful for temporary exhibits. Buy Photo Detroit Institute of Arts Director of IT Richard Scott, left shows a group of children visiting the museum how visitors will soon be able to take a mobile tour using augmented reality which for example will allow visitors to have an x-ray view of the skeleton of an Egyptian mummy when viewed through Lumin and understand how he might have died in Detroit on Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2017.  (Photo: Romain Blanquart, Detroit Free Press) It’s easy to get lost in the DIA. But when you click on the first stop, the Babylonian Empire, a set of dots connects a path right on your screen. This is called wayfinding. “These buildings are very old and have had many additions over the years,” said Salort-Pons. “Sometimes it’s difficult for visitors to know where they are, how to move from point A to point B. This technology allows 3D mapping so you can actually walk the building and get perfectly oriented.” Unlike Pokemon Go, which saw users walking into traffic from not paying attention to their surroundings, Lumin shows what’s in front of you: If a person walks by, or if you’re about to encounter a set of steps, it will be there on the screen. The stop itself is flagged by an orange marker that can’t be missed. At each stop, you’ll find an interactive opportunity. “We have a mobile storytelling platform that allows any customer to build their experience — they can create a tour, treasure hunt, games,” explained GuidiGo CEO David Lerman. When viewing the art through augmented reality, you’ll see it in a way that blends overlays, videos, photographs, sounds and touch-activated animations; each provides contextual information. “Without any words, there’s a tremendous amount of explanation,” said Scott. At the Babylonian Empire, for example, you’ll see a 3D reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate. It was created by closely studying samples of photographs. By rotating your phone, you can also see it at different angles. But to see more details, you have to walk closer — zooming doesn’t work with augmented reality because it’s a real object. “One of the challenges with AR is that it’s very flash-bang,” said Megan DiRienzo, interpretive planner at the DIA. “We chose experiences that help people engage with works of art rather than just wowing them with beautiful AR animation.” As augmented reality becomes more integrated into our daily lives, new user behaviors will have to be learned. At the Native American stop, visitors will need to listen for the storm-related noises of thunderbirds.  “The stop is very tricky because we’re asking people to tap and listen, not tap and look,” said DiRienzo. Since it’s still in prototype phase, Lumin is not yet formatted for the visually or hearing impaired. There’s also the question about what it does to visitor choice. “People have expressed concern that if you’re following (the wayfinder), you’re not noticing all the beautiful works of art around you,” said DiRienzo. That’s why user feedback is important. There’s also the question of what will happen if too much technology is brought into the art world. “Technology is important, but technology should not replace the works of art,” said Salort-Pons. “Technology is a springboard to help us better understand the work of art. It creates dialogue with the work of art and helps the visitor actually pay attention to it.” Other museums around the world are also implementing augmented reality mobile tours in the near future, but as the DIA was ahead of the game, the innovation came with risks. “We didn’t know where this was going to take us because there was no past experience,” said Salort-Pons. “But we believed that this could be the technology of the future.” Lumin won’t replace all levels of learning in the museum: You can still count on labels explaining background and history. “I think Lumin is going to facilitate a lot,” continued Salort-Pons. “People will have better accessibility to the collection and the end goal is that we’re going to serve our community better.” How to experience Lumin Beginning Wednesday, the DIA will have 40 phones available at the Farnsworth entrance. You'll be asked for a photo ID in exchange, which can be picked up once the phone is returned. To rent a device, you must be 18 or older. (Don’t try to walk out with a phone: It will lock on you.) Visitors can expect a 30- to 35-minute tour for the initial seven stops, followed by a 45-minute to one-hour tour once it grows to include the full 10 stops. The use of Lumin is free with regular museum admission. Admission to the DIA is free for residents of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. Others: $12.50 adults, $8 seniors, $6 ages 6-17.  9 a.m.-4 p.m. Tue.-Thu., 9 a.m.-10 p.m. Fri., 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Sat.-Sun.5200 Woodward, Detroit. 313-833-7900. www.dia.org.

Despite RBC nabbing a big name, it’s hard to be optimistic that the stars of a hot, made-in-Canada tech field won’t decamp to the U.S. anyway Adrian Lee January 18, 2017 Follow @AdrianKLee Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   A Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) sign is seen outside of a branch in Ottawa. (Chris Wattie/Reuters) These days, deep learning is all the rage. Tech’s biggest players, from Intel to Amazon, are betting big on the artificial intelligence technique modelled after the instincts of the human brain, with its ability to read patterns, sense rules, and make the best decision accordingly. Not long ago, Google spent more than $400 million to buy industry-leading startup DeepMind, and scored a major tech and marketing coup when the computer AlphaGo defeated grandmaster Lee Sedol at the possibility-lush game of Go—an achievement hundreds of times more complex than when Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess. Deep learning is being touted as a way forward for climate science, medicine and genomics; it’s already embedded in the way you search for something online, when you Google image search for, say, “cat,” and feline photos come up as a result of AI learning of what “cat” means. But it wasn’t always the popular kid in the block. In its early days in the 1980s, deep learning’s mostly Canadian pioneers—in particular, the trio of Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun, who worked largely out of an institute in Toronto—were dismissed as foolish apostates. “At the time, it didn’t solve big practical AI problems, it didn’t replace the existing technology,” said Hinton, considered the godfather of deep learning, in a 2016 interview with Maclean’s. But when computing power started to advance at an incredible rate, deep learning’s potential for AI was unlocked, turning huge piles of data into artificial intelligence that could, effectively, learn like our brain. MORE: Geoffrey Hinton explains how deep learning works Canada, though, hasn’t enjoyed much benefit for being an early adopter on the forefront of this technology. American companies have mostly picked the cupboard clean: Hinton now works with Google, LeCun leads Facebook’s AI research lab, and Bengio is an adviser with IBM, whose work out of the University of Montreal has earned significant funding from Google and beyond. Even Hinton has acknowledged this is cause for concern, in a recent Globe and Mail commentary written with other leading deep-learning experts: “There is one solution that will help keep the best minds in Canada, solve the current and future talent gap for domestic businesses, lure investment from foreign data-rich companies, and ensure Canada leads future AI breakthroughs: We must build a world-leading AI Institute in Toronto.” So it’s not insignificant that the Royal Bank of Canada’s Research in Deep Learning division—still shiny from its launch just seven months ago—has acquired the services of a big name in the field, adding Richard Sutton to its roster. Sutton wrote the book on the field of reinforcement learning, a technique which allows AI to teach itself what the best actions are using a reward-punishment system of its own, an area of deep learning that played a role in the success of DeepMind’s AlphaGo project. He will advise the group, currently based out of the University of Toronto, and also collaborate with RBC’s second AI research lab, which will be in Edmonton. “A lot of the development in deep learning came out of Canadian universities, yet the industry wasn’t positioned well enough to capitalize on that innovation, so we’ve lost a lot of people to south of the border,” said Foteini Agrafioti, who leads RBC’s deep-learning division. “That’s something we feel, as the biggest company in the country, we have the responsibility to invest in.” While Sutton is certainly not a household name, he is a major figure in deep learning, and a significant addition for a Canadian company nonetheless. Without a central hub for academics to branch out on their work in Canada, deep learning’s southbound pioneers served as pied pipers, bringing their students with them, creating a brain drain. Banking, too, seems to have plenty to offer deep-learning experts—in particular, rich historical data sets from decades of business. “The backbone of machine learning is data sets, and without that you’re really handcuffed. The bank has really interesting data sets from decades of market data that can be used to solve open problems right now,” says Agrafioti. Banking also offers some tantalizing practical applications for deep-learning innovators, too; of the three possibilities listed by Agrafioti—personalized AI-driven customer service, real-time fraud prevention and risk management—it’s the last one that might appeal most to those interested in industry disruption. Deep learning’s use of patterns to predict future activity appears to have tremendous potential for stock brokers, investment bankers, and asset managers—to assist them, at least for now. (For the record, Agrafioti demurs about the potential automation of those positions, rightly noting that there is no industry consensus on whether AI can ever truly become as or more powerful than the human brain.) It is, however, unclear if Canada’s banks—collectively the country’s largest companies—could reverse the tide of expertise migrating southward on their own. While the price tag of RBC’s investment in this lab is unclear, beyond Agrafioti’s cited cost of “tens of millions of dollars over the coming years,” Canada’s banks are unlikely to be able to match the dollar figures splashed around by companies like Tesla, which invested US$1 billion into Open AI in 2015. Canada’s Big Six banks themselves are less likely to feel the need to innovate, insulated as they are against the competitive agitation of fintech companies by their market position and regulatory bulwarks, and cognizant that Canada’s venture capitalism industry—usually the fuel for fintech—is far less fulsome than America’s. For these comfortable behemoth banks, the innovation stakes aren’t as high, a fact that Agrafioti acknowledges: “Our rate of adoption is, of course, not as fast as some tech companies.” Still, RBC deserves credit for at least pushing to develop more homegrown research. Scotiabank, CIBC, TD Canada Trust and Bank of Montreal were not able to respond at press time to requests for details about their own research into deep learning. (Scotiabank did, however, start a “digital factory” in 2015, which professed to partner with fintech startups to develop new technologies, and gifted the University of Toronto with $1.75 million to study “disruptive technologies,” while several big-bank CEOs acknowledged that AI needed to be harnessed within the industry at a recent conference.) But will it be enough to reverse the AI brain drain on its own? Surely not. The lure of money, vast data sets, and powerful computing in Silicon Valley remains a powerful pull for those at the peak of their profession. But if Canadian companies can learn anything from deep learning, it’s to take lessons from the many patterns of the past—struggles to innovate, and an inability to keep our best talent here—and project the right way forward in the future. And where better to start, than with the large data sets at the fingertips of our powerful banks?

Obviously, we don’t own smart people or their ideas; they may go where they’re most wanted and/or where opportunity awaits them. One might ask, in the days of Harpernomics what signal was sent by directing much of the investment capital (in some years the majority) and much of government research funding into raw resource extraction? What message did researchers working under government support take away from the muzzle? With Canadians being notable homers, it takes more than a little pressure to push them away; however, the ‘brain drain’ is hardly a new notion. Reply ↓ GeraldR on January 18, 2017 at 9:17 pm Canada should rise to this challenge by making it easier for our young people to obtain the appropriate training. Instead, Trudeau repeatedly talks about bringing in the “best and brightest” from other countries to fill our Universities and hi-tech job openings. It has probably never been harder for young Canadians to obtain higher education. Besides the steep financial cost, gaining admission to many fields is extremely difficult and student housing is in short supply. At UBC, for example, the Dean of Engineering has complained that they can only take 1 in 5 qualified applicants. Meanwhile the University touts the fact that a third of their student body is made up of foreign students and this is increasing rapidly. This is directly related to the underfunding of the University by government – UBC’s financial plan states that admissions of Canadian students to most faculties has been frozen and all increases in enrollment will be made up from foreign students, who pay higher tuition fees and can help make up budget shortfalls. Something is terribly wrong. Reply ↓ Olde Grouch on January 21, 2017 at 9:43 pm Cancel reply Sign in to comment. You're logged in as . Logout. Loading profile... Unexpected error. Please try again.

Katie hasn’t just deleted her Twitter tweet in the wake of Rich’s tweet about 10-year-old Barron Trump, but she has also deleted her entire Twitter account. The recent development came in the wake of Rich coming under heavy fire for tweeting that Barron Trump — the 10-year-old son of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump — would grow up to be the country’s first homeschool shooter. The inference was that Barron would somehow get fed up with a homeschooled type of life and react with violence, even though Barron attends an elite private school. Katie’s joke was taken as more than a joke. After all, Rich didn’t make the joke as part of an SNL skit — as would be in the realm of Katie’s SNL job as a writer — even though SNL as a show would probably stay away from jokes about Barron. Instead, Rich made the joke about Barron — a real boy, a human being — and that joke fell flat with some people on social media. Update: SNL removed Katie Rich’s name from the Saturday Night Live writing credits as of the Saturday, January 21, show.

After turning Rich’s Twitter account to a private status, Katie deleted her Twitter account, leaving many to wonder if Rich has been fired from SNL. As seen in the photos above and below, Barron attended the 58th presidential inauguration parade for President Trump in Washington, on Friday, January 20. [Image by Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Images] The Google cache of Katie’s Twitter account is still alive as of this writing, due to the fact that Rich likely deleted her Twitter account recently. The Google cache of twitter.com/katiemaryrich shows how Katie’s Twitter account appeared on January 21, at 20:22:50 GMT. As reported by Heavy, Katie got a lot of backlash for tweeting that “Barron will be the country’s first homeschool shooter” — a tweet that Rich would publish on January 20, the same day that Barron was seen by a massive amount of people as Barron hung out with his dad on his big day. Eventually, Rich would delete that tweet about Barron, and Katie’s bio on Rich’s personal website would claim to be down. The Google cache of Katie’s website would explain Rich’s accolades, including her movie writing credits, with the last line highlighting Katie’s SNL job and her love of the Chicago Bears. “She currently lives in New York City and writes for Saturday Night Live. Follow her @katiemaryrich. Go Bears!” Katie’s Facebook page that once appeared at facebook.com/katie.rich.923 is also gone. Meanwhile, the Change.org page titled “FIRE Katie Rich from SNL & NBC” garnered 8,225 signatures as of this writing. [Image by Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Images] The petition states that if Katie isn’t fired due to her tweet about Barron, along with a fine and written apology issued to the Trump Family, then Rich’s tweet should cause NBC to experience a ban from the White House press room. “Online bullying of children (including and especially those in our White House!) by any adult is [unacceptable] behavior and should not be tolerated under any circumstances. If Ms. Rich does not get fired, heftily fined AND issue a written apology to our First Family immediately, NBC should be banned from our White House press room and shunned by our new administration, and SNL should be boycotted into oblivion.” As of this writing, the SNL Twitter account has not made a mention of Rich being fired. The Saturday, January 21, episode of SNL may prove whether or not Katie has been fired from SNL when the final credits roll, and SNL viewers can determine if Katie’s name is mentioned therein — that’s if SNL previously included Rich’s name in the SNL credits. Less than four hours until we're live with @azizansari and @BigSean! #SNL pic.twitter.com/euWas4PZwX — Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) January 22, 2017 A search on Twitter for news about Rich in the wake of her Barron tweet proves there is heated feedback from those who think Katie should be fired from SNL.

Photos Videos Topics Live SL 170/5 (19.5) - SA 169/5 (20) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Republic Day 2017 Kaabil Raees Donald Trump Bigg Boss 10 Home India CBI probe finds further irregularities by Delhi Govt in 'Talk to AK' programme Arvind Kejriwal Shares581 Sumit Kumar Singh | Sun, 22 Jan 2017-06:55am , New Delhi , DNA Before registering a case against Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and many government officers under the Prevention of Corruption Act in 'Talk to AK' programme scam, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is trying to establish 11 violations and irregularities made while awarding the contract to Perfect Relations. The agency was astonished to find that in the Directorate of Information and Publicity (DIP) files, there were remarks of Gajendra Haldea, Member, Delhi Dialogue Commission (DDC), wherein he has opined that the commission had engaged some consultants and a similar pattern could be seen in the 'Talk to AK' programme. It was revealed that DDC had engaged six consultants for a remuneration of Rs 1,55,000 per month. When a similar pattern was followed, it was clear that one consultant could have been appointed on remuneration. Instead, the government chose to spend Rs 1,05,00,000 through Perfect Relations for the same work, thus wasting the taxpayers money. "It is not understood why those consultants were hired when the work is being done through private agencies," the document noted. The other issue regards the use of Google, YouTube and Facebook. These three agencies had allegedly been hired by Perfect Relations to run the social media campaign on their networks, thus flouting official norms. As per the documents accessed by DNA, the agency is trying to find out why the Directorate of Information and Publicity (DIP) has claimed that Google, YouTube and Facebook are not proprietary in nature. "Why did DIP not see that there are other competitors such as Yahoo, Instagram, Rediff, Twitter and others," the enquiry documents stated. Furthermore, DIP while awarding the contract has mentioned that as far as Google and YouTube were concerned, they can have a credit line which can enable one to make payment within 60 days but the same is not available with Facebook. The agency stated that they are unable to understand what circumstances compelled the DIP to ask Perfect Relations to make payment to those agencies and reclaim it later on. The agency also stated that if the modalities of the programme was discussed on June 26, 2016 in the presence of all stake-holders, then why was the proposal initiated only on July 6, 2016. "Further, what was the compelling necessity to launch it on July 8, 2016? It appears that the delay is caused to avoid the thorough examination and to subvert the process of tender," the documents stated. They agency is also probing why the DIP or any other consultant or officer did not communicate with Google, YouTube or Facebook to ascertain the procedure, rates, and mode of payment, specially when in the case of Google and YouTube credit line facilities of 60 days is available with DIP. The CBI has so far established that the proposal submitted by Perfect Relations was an ex-facie case to conflict of interest where the consultant voluntarily and ethically became the beneficiary of its own advice in terms of both selection and potential financial implications. They have found that the Pr. Secretary (Finance) Dharmendar Sharma recommended for termination of the contract of the consultant on July 14 and for not releasing the payment but now they are trying to establish why his suggestions and recommendations were over-ruled by Sisodia. "It is a clear violation of Rule 154 (Single Tender Enquiry) and Rule 184 (outsourcing by choice) of the General Financial Rules as no detail justification is given except the urgency and time constraint," the documents stated. The agency is unable to understand that why the Cabinet Note placed before the council of Ministers on September 1, 2016 and till date the actual amount to be paid along with bills and proof making payment has neither been mentioned nor placed on the DIP file. "Rather the Honourable Deputy Chief Minister (Sisodia) acceded to by Honble Delhi Chief Minister (Arvind Kejriwal) on September 1, 2016, remarked on the file (saying) "the matter is already delayed in view of this it may be placed in today's Cabinet meeting," the agency stated. Further they are probing what led to Perfect Relations to forgo their agency fees and also agreed to make payment of more than Rs 1 crore to the agencies. "The reason needs to be specified and probed properly," the document stated. The CBI is also trying to find out that when the work had already been executed in July 2016, then what was the urgency for placing it before the Council of Ministers, as a tabled item, without obtaining comments of Law and Judicial and planning Department as suggested by Secretary DIP SS Yadav. In the end, the agency said that they have so far not found any justification on the DIP file as to why the programme was being done. "No public purpose seems to be served to citizens of Delhi as the target audience is from other states also Punjab, Gujarat, Goa where elections are scheduled in early 2017. It is also not understood as to why it is launched on a pan India basis," it stated. The CBI has already registered a preliminary enquiry against Manish Sisodia for irregularities in awarding a contract of a hour-long interactive session 'Talk to AK' on January 18, 2017. This case regards an interactive session where Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal held 'Talk to AK' on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Mann ki Baat' on July 17 last year —where he took questions through social media. But, he allegedly used this opportunity to reach out to people of Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Punjab, apart from Delhi, by spending taxpayers' money to the tune of Rs 1.05 crore.

Small but magnificently mighty, Polk Audio’s Magnifi Mini is one of best little soundbars you can buy. Highs Powerful punch in a small package Expansive soundstage for the size Brilliant blend between bar and sub Warm and detailed midrange Intuitive and concise design Lows Treble occasionally sounds strident and distorted Only one HDMI input 5.1 surround is more like 3.1 DT Editors' Rating 8.0 DT Editors' Choice Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Speaker Reviews > Sound Bar Reviews > Polk Audio MagniFi Mini review By Ryan Waniata Posted on 01.21.17 Research Center: Polk Audio MagniFi Mini Polk Audio’s teensy, tiny Magnifi Mini doesn’t look much like a traditional soundbar — more like a sound brick, or maybe a sound stub. Yet, in many ways the Magnifi Mini embodies what soundbars are all about. With it’s forgettable foot print and forceful sound, the Magnifi Mini is a great solution for those seeking no-hassle TV audio enhancement. Add in a price tag of just $300, and this little sound blaster makes a serious case as the small-profile soundbar to beat. Out of the box Pulling the Magnifi Mini from its box lets the unit’s tiny size sink in. Stretching a shade past 13-inches long, the compact capsule looks more like a Bluetooth speaker than any home theater solution we’ve encountered. That said, its hefty weight hints at the array of six drivers and other solid internals within. An included down-firing sub is almost the bar’s exact opposite: Set in a traditionally sized cabinet, the unit strikes an imposing stature compared to its counterpart, yet it’s light as a feather when you pick it up. As a result, this countertop duo is surprisingly portable, allowing you to easily pack the pieces up and take them on the road, should that strike your fancy. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Riding along in the box is a fully loaded IR remote layered in rubberized plastic on top, as well as the necessary power cables, HDMI, Optical, and 3.5mm cables, and a small setup manual. Features and design Small but furious, the Magnifi Mini is also a handsome little devil. Its namesake is no accident, as the unit looks a lot like Polk’s original Magnifi soundbar, squashed by magic hands to better fit your TV stand. While it easily disappears beneath your TV, angular sides and a silver plate set at the center of the unit’s peppered speaker grill make for a tidy and appealing aesthetic. The bar’s 13.4-inch length is matched by a height and depth of 3.11-inches and 4.25-inches, respectively. The Magnifi Mini’s wide soundstage is almost magical in its expansiveness. Beneath the surface are six drivers, including dual 2.5-inch drivers at dead center flanked by a pair of 2-inch drivers at both sides, which are set at an angle to fire off a wider soundstage. The lanky subwoofer stands about 14.5-inches tall and deep, and 7.4-inches wide, sporting a 6.5 inch downward-firing driver. Polk Audio dubs the system as a 5.1 surround solution thanks to DSP and Dolby Digital decoding, but despite offering a much wider soundstage than you’d expect, performance offers a 3.1 experience at best. (More on that below.) Inputs at the back include HDMI with ARC, digital Optical input, and 3.5mm Aux input. The hardwire options are matched by wireless connection in the form of Bluetooth, as well as Wi-Fi connection via Google Cast. The unit’s big sound is due in part to Polk Audio’s SDA surround sound DSP, while Voice Adjust allows you to crank up the center channel for clearer dialog. There’s also a night mode to limit dynamics when the family is sleeping and a choice of three DSP modes for film, sports, and music. Polk Audio MagniFi Mini Compared To Vizio SB4551-D5 Samsung HW-K950 Dolby Atmos Nakamichi Shockwafe Pro 7.1 Yamaha YSP-5600 Definitive Technology W Studio Micro… Monoprice 42-inch Sound Bar Klipsch R-20B Yamaha SRT-1000 Klipsch R-10B Sony HT-XT1 Philips HTB3525B Denon DHT-S514 Harman Kardon Sabre SB 35 Paradigm Soundtrack Energy Power Bar Elite A section of LEDs on the front of the bar indicate volume, bass, or Voice level, while colored LEDs indicate source. Basic controls rest atop the unit’s rubberized control panel, while the loaded remote allows for quick and easy adjustment of bass and voice volume control, basic volume, input, and DSP selection. It’s a simple and intuitive setup, and ARC connection allows your TV remote to take the wheel as well. Setup The easiest and highest-quality connection is done via ARC HDMI, which allows for quality digital sound and helps the system “hand-shake” with your TV’s CEC information, allowing you to control power and volume via your TV’s remote. Alternatively, you can simply connect your TV’s optical audio output, or connect any 3.5mm source into the Aux input. Bluetooth pairing is done by pressing the Bluetooth key on top and pairing on your source device, while connection to Wi-Fi is done via Google’s Cast app. As a minimalist sound solution, the Magnifi Mini doesn’t include multiple HDMI inputs, meaning all HDMI source components must be connected via your TV and, therefore, will rely on your TV to decode the surround sound codecs (unless your TV supports surround sound pass-through). This is not the optimal sounding solution in most setups, but considering the price and size of the Magnifi Mini, we’ll give it a pass — this system isn’t designed for audiophile-grade playback. Performance The first thing you notice about the Magnifi Mini is just how big it actually sounds, especially when it comes to the width of its stereo image. While it certainly doesn’t reach 5.1 stature, thanks to its angled design and some DSP trickery, this unit’s soundstage is almost magical in its expansiveness. You can enjoy constantly surprising those who walk in the room as you divulge the sound source: “That much sound is coming from that little speaker?!” Bill Roberson/Digital Trends It’s not just the wide soundstage that impresses here, either. The near-uncanny balance between the sub and the bar is a sonic partnership made in heaven. The proficiency of any soundbar/subwoofer combo is dependent upon the effectiveness of blending the lower frequencies to mold two distinctive sound sources into one, and the Magnifi Mini’s dual units have this partnership down pat. The sub fills up the bar’s lower midrange brilliantly, allowing for a warm and punchy thump that appears to come from dead center, while the bar is free to fill in the top side with clarity and some impressive detail. The system is at its best playing back basic TV, from your favorite Netflix streams to the NFL playoffs. The sub reaches down into the lower bass with just enough authority to create vibrancy and excitement in the necessary moments, while the bar offers rich resonance in dialog, mixed with some sparkle in the upper midrange that lets through just enough detail to keep you transfixed on the subject at hand. The compact capsule looks more like a Bluetooth speaker than a soundbar. When it comes to powerful cinematic moments, the Magnifi Mini may not be the baddest bar around, but it gets the job done. The fury of fantasy flicks like Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is recreated with plenty of verve — the pounding drums of war, the singing arrows flying through the air, and the thunderous spells of good and evil beings are all well captured, while dialog floats on top with clarity. We did notice a few moments when we had to ride the volume a bit; Softer scenes didn’t have as much midrange presence as we’d like, forcing the volume up, while the action scenes came back in with explosive force that jolted us to lower the volume again. Another quibble we have is a spindly tone in the upper midrange that occasionally borders on distortion. This is especially present with action films pumping at full force, as explosions and other jolting effects tend to cause a little breakup in that sparkly upper register. The same issue affects music playback, washing out crash cymbals, especially on brighter recordings. The Police’s Synchronicity is a particular offender, as Stuart Copeland’s cymbal play is constantly fighting the tips of those small tweeters. Still, as long as you don’t expect audiophile reverie here, the Magnifi Mini is a welcome companion for everyday TV and music playback. Using the system as our daily sound machine for weeks, we were constantly amazed that all that warm, detailed sound was coming from such a tiny system. Our Take Offering massive sound in a tiny package, Polk Audio’s Magnifi Mini is one of the most affordable and intuitive sound solutions in the soundbar genre, and one well worth considering for those looking to improve their TV’s sound without even nudging the furniture. How long will it last The DT Accessory Pack AmazonBasics digital Optical Audio Toslink cable $6.49 AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cable $8 AmazonBasics 3.5mm Male to Male stereo audio cable $7 Polk Audio is a veteran brand with a solid track record, and the Magnifi Mini’s simple and robust design should make it a stalwart piece of your audio collection for years to come. What are the alternatives While not nearly as compact, Yamaha’s YAS-203 is a go-to soundbar at the $300-400 price point, and a solid alternative. Those looking for richer, more detailed sound — especially for music playback — may also want to look at Pioneer’s Andrew Jones SP-SB23W, though that will likely cost you more. For the moment, few alternatives at this size, price, and quality level exist. Should you buy it Yes. If you’re looking to shrink down your system’s profile, or simply enhance your TV audio with a minimalist solution, the Magnifi Mini is one of the best choices available. Share

Close share panel Media captionAaron Puzey cycled the length of Britain without leaving home. A digital games programmer from Angus is thought to be the first person to cycle from Land's End to John o'Groats in virtual reality (VR). Aaron Puzey did it without leaving home. He used an exercise bike, publicly available images and a smartphone app he wrote himself. He rode more than 900 miles, burning 50,000 calories in the process. Now he's hoping his creation - called CycleVR - will become a commercial proposition. Image caption Aaron pedalled the length of Britain without leaving his living room For a dedicated cyclist, even January can offer some lovely days to go out for a spin but even more excuses to stay in. Aaron Puzey has created the best of both worlds. He knew riding his exercise bike was good for him but staring at the wall was boring. So he set off to pedal from one end of Britain to the other in virtual reality. Image caption Aaron works for a "digital toy workshop" He left Land's End last Spring. Sort of. By the time we met he had spent 85 hours in the saddle, spread over seven months. He was virtually on the outskirts of John o'Groats. Or should that be on the outskirts of John o'Groats, virtually? Because in reality we were in the warmth of his living room in Monifieth. On a TV monitor and in his 3D VR headset, images from Google Street View showed the famous signpost drawing closer. By happy chance the Street View camera had captured a group of people standing at the finish line - a virtual welcoming committee. Aaron whooped as bright yellow letters spelled out CYCLE COMPLETE! Image caption The moment Aaron reached the end of the journey "It feels fantastic," he says. "It's such a good thing after six to seven months of cycling." How did he do it? Physically, by pedalling. A lot. Technologically, he did it by creating CycleVR as an app for his Android smartphone. An inexpensive cadence meter attached to the exercise bike measures how fast he is pedalling. That information helps create moving images from the Google Street View data. These are sent to a VR headset, another component that didn't bust the budget. The CycleVR app tied it all together. Image caption Aaron programmed flying cubes to show him which way to go "It was just a little mobile phone app that I wrote in my spare time," Aaron says. "It probably took me three or four weeks. "Just a little bit of research on how it works - and it came together really quickly." That makes it sound easy, but then his day job is in Dundee's thriving digital games industry. Denki Games describes itself as a digital toy workshop. It has contributed to titles like Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto. Gary Penn, Denki's creative director, says he wasn't surprised when Aaron told him about his personal side project. He says: "You thought, 'I'm surprised nobody's thought of that before'. "Because it was a pretty obvious idea once he'd mentioned it. "But no, not a surprise because he's always making things from things." Aaron's favourite places on his digital journey include Bristol, the Lake District and Perthshire. He took just three wrong turns along the way, overtook four horses and carts and witnessed two men having a punch-up. Image caption Among the sights he saw along the way was this fight Google stitches together its Street View panoramas from 2D digital pictures - so where does the 3D come from? Aaron says enough information is already compressed into the Street View images. CycleVR extracts the third dimension from information that might otherwise remain hidden. Any problems? One common to many VR users: nausea. Aaron found turning corners in VR made him feel sick. The solution was to tweak the app so the moving images "strobed" round corners. The visuals are a bit jumpier but there is a considerably reduced chance of reacquainting yourself with your lunch. The next step will be to turn CycleVR into a commercial proposition. Potential customers may be influenced by some more statistics. The number of steep hills Aaron had to climb? Zero. Headwinds faced? Zero. Crashes, dog attacks, icy roads, rainstorms - in the VR world, not one of them either. Plus, it's always daylight on Street View and you can get off the bike any time and go for a cuppa or nice lie down. Aaron is now inviting suggestions for where in the world he should ride next. Without, of course, leaving Monifieth. Street View certainly offers plenty of scope. To me, Japan looks quite tempting. But only if someone creates an app that will do the pedalling as well.

In May 2016, a man in the US was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway. Reports of the incident say the driver had the semi-autonomous Autopilot program engaged at the time of the crash, and it was unclear whether the vehicle’s systems didn’t detect the turning truck ahead or whether the driver had ignored safety warnings to re-take control of the vehicle. This week, however, the NHTSA ruled that there was no fault with the vehicle and that the driver had to have ignored safety warnings to maintain control of the vehicle – Bloomberg reports. “The auto industry just let out a giant sigh of relief,” said Dave Sullivan, an analyst at consultancy AutoPacific Inc. “This could have started a snowball effect of letting automakers and suppliers become liable for human error.” Above: Google’s Lexus RX450h-based self-driving car prototype The ruling is not only a win for Tesla but a win for numerous other companies that have invested billions of dollars into autonomous driving systems, including Ford, Google, General Motors and the Volkswagen Group. The rationale behind the push for self-driving vehicles is the belief that eliminating human error will reduce the amount of collisions on the road, thus reducing the number of people killed in traffic accidents every year. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, said the decision was “very positive”, and made note of the fact the company’s vehicle crash rate had dropped by 38 per cent since introducing its auto-steer system. However, IHS Markit senior analyst, Stephanie Brinley, told Bloomberg it’s far too early to fully trust autonomous vehicles despite the findings. “This decision does not in and of itself tell us what will happen down the road,” she said. “It’s really too soon.” NHTSA spokesperson, Bryan Thomas, added that automatic braking systems and semi-autonomous driving technologies are still not capable of addressing all crash situations. Above: Tesla Model S Since the incident, Tesla has updated its Autopilot system, with Version 8.0 employing a ‘three strike’ approach to prompt the driver to put their hands back on the wheel. The first prompt makes three beeping sounds, and if the driver ignores all three stages of warnings, Autopilot will be disengaged for the remainder of the journey and the vehicle slows down. NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas told Bloomberg this week that car makers must go to lengths to plan for drivers that fail to monitor the system and the environment around them. Manufacturers will be expected in future to provide clearer, overt warnings about the limitations of autonomous driving technology. “It’s not enough to simply put it in an owner’s manual,” Thomas said. When the new Autopilot 8.0 software was released, Elon Musk went as far to say Version 8.0 would have saved the life of the man killed in the accident. Do you trust autonomous cars?

Leslie D'Monte AI is a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. Photo: iStock Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan is an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. He specialises in artificial intelligence (AI) and is the only author from India who is part of an 18-member study panel of the Stanford University-hosted report titled Artificial Intelligence and Life. Kalyanakrishnan’s expertise broadly fits in the area of machine learning. Called reinforcement learning, it defines what actions software agents should take to maximize a certain type of reward after learning from reward and punishment. In an interview, he urges people to be more optimistic about the things AI can do rather than be obsessed with the fear around AI machines. Edited excerpts: How was the Stanford AI report conceived? How did you get involved? In the last 5-10 years, the public has been forced to take notice of AI. You do searches, for instance, and get the information you want. You can talk to your phone using Apple’s Siri. There is so much intelligence in your car. Everywhere, intelligent software is assisting you in your lifestyle in a very noticeable way. The common man’s perception is that AI is taking away jobs. Jobs that people used to do about 10 years back have been replaced either partially or even fully in some cases by software and hardware developments. This triggered the conversation, which led to experts being asked about their opinion of where AI is heading and what can be done about it. In the last few months, there have been some alarmist views, even by physicist Stephen Hawking. Moreover, even a person like Elon Musk, who is responsible for taking technology forward with his ventures like Tesla and SpaceX, has expressed similar sentiments—that things could go awfully wrong once we have AI doing actions that human beings traditionally have done. Eric (Horvitz, a computer scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft) has been with Microsoft Research and is primarily responsible for this report. He decided that we needed a more sober assessment of AI—not based on emotions but one that is more rigorous and scientific. We will have a study panel every five years. This is the first one. I was chosen by Peter (Peter Stone, professor at the department of computer science, University of Texas) because the study panel was looking at diversity in age, gender and geography. This came together in May 2015, and we were given a year to do this. As a group, we agreed that it is true that AI is game-changing, that it is moving at a fast pace. Hence, we did not forecast beyond 2030, because it is not scientific to do so when there is so much uncertainty about the concept. Can you list some of these uncertainties? Look back to 1995. I don’t think it was possible way back then to predict accurately some of the things that we have today. The Internet has happened, so have smartphones and social networks. It’s the nature of science and technology which makes it difficult to predict beyond a certain period. There are just too many variables. What was your contributions to the AI report? My contribution was more to define AI. We take intelligence for granted in human beings. We expect people to be able to do certain tasks, to answer questions meaningfully etc. So what are the operating principles that define intelligence? How is it constructed? What are its mathematical foundations? We have asked these questions earlier too, and even in the 70s we had automata (a machine which performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions). For instance, you still have churches where clocks do specific tasks (for example, birds chiming) when their gongs strike midnight. The confluence of software and mathematics really took place in the 1950s when computers became available. We had the Eniac (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) which was built during the war (World War II), and it became possible to build computer systems that could exhibit intelligence. So technically speaking, the first such computer systems were aimed at helping soldiers during the War—used to calculate things like the trajectory of a missile; planning logistics, etc. This explains why DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has been funding computer science in general and AI for a long time. But the pioneers of AI have also been thinking about AI in scientific terms. Scientists like Alan Turing, who can be considered to be the fountainhead of AI despite the fact that he did not have access to real hardware, was one (such, who was), thinking about writing a programme to play chess. So what exactly is AI? The term was coined only in 1956 in a workshop (Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence) put together by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester. So you can think of AI as a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. You know intelligence when you see it. But how do you get an artificial agent to show intelligence? Most people would consider a machine to be endowed with AI if it performs like a human being. You can think of examples like Google search or Google Maps. Computers can play chess, which was the holy grail of AI, and now even beat grandmasters. We think of intelligence as a spectrum that is constantly being propelled forward. And AI is what can do this. In some sense, AI is this desire to replicate intelligence in hardware. It is also, in a strange sense, the sum total of what an AI researcher is doing—something in robotics, NLP (natural language processing), etc. AI does not have a rigid definition. Hence we went with (Nils J.) Nilsson’s definition in the AI report (AI is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment). What does the AI concept comprise? The broad architecture of an intelligent agent is one that senses the environment, which does some amount of thinking, and then takes actions in the real world. If you consider sensing, there is the whole area of Computer Vision, which tries to make sense of objects we see. We, then, have the field of speech processing that has to do with audio. When you go to actuation, you have fields like robotics, haptics, etc. AI also comprises machine learning, knowledge representation and logic. Humans typically make changes to their behaviour as they learn from experiences. So if the experience that a programme undergoes somehow changes its behaviour, you can say that the programme is applying machine learning. Now we have data-driven machine learning. Consider the case of hospitals gathering patient data—vital parameters like blood sugar level, age, gender, blood pressure, etc. Now let’s presume the hospital has collected this data for, say, 1,000 patients and diagnosed diabetic patients from this lot. A machine learning algorithm can then sift through this data and learn a predictor and predict whether a new patient (whose body parameters are available) is diabetic or not. Similar is the case with Google search that has moved from also displaying irrelevant links to using machine learning algorithms that have refined this task over the last few years. The technical base for designing machine learning systems comes primarily from streams like probability and statistics. Then we have NLP, which is the most natural. By speaking natural languages that is quite different from the language that computers use to communicate (1s and 0s—bits and bytes), NLP has got to a state when you can take a shot at machine translation. The basic building blocks for NLP comprise actual models of languages. The linguistic hierarchy of language begins with syntax, moving on to semantics (study of relationships between words and how we construct meaning) and later, pragmatics (e.g. you can use sarcasm, puns—typically where you need an understanding of culture and context). Anyone dealing with NLP has to know these branches. What about Deep Learning? Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) aim to simulate the human brain. They can be used to map inputs to predictions. There are standard learning algorithms to train ANNs based on data. Neural networks have been around for almost three decades but it was very difficult to train large and deep (with more layers) neural networks. Technically, they get stuck in the so-called Local Minimum (defined as the best solution to a problem within a small neighbourhood of possible solutions as opposed to the concept of ‘global optimum’, which is the optimal solution when every possible solution is considered). Ironically, you do need ANNs with many layers. Deep Learning helps us to successfully train larger ANNs. Will true AI ever be achieved? This has divided researchers over the decades. Most people in the AI community subscribe to the view that it does not really matter if machines are exactly replicating what human beings can do, as long as we do things that are intelligent and of value. For example, we have software that can fly an aircraft—very differently from how a human being would do it but it is doing it nevertheless. What are the challenges? Explaining AI to the public itself is a challenge. That said, can inputs be automatically learnt or combined in ways that can give higher level abstractions, to make the task of prediction easier? In the context of vision, the inputs to computer vision systems is just images (matrix of 0s and 1s). But deep learning algorithms are able to abstract things out like edges, boundaries, locations of objects, etc. You can have a deep learning system to autonomously drive a car. The software agent needs to reason about stop signs, etc., (and) not only about camera images; it has to learn a host of features from scratch. The other challenge is that hardware needs to match the pace of development in software. The brain also uses less energy than the chips that we are building today, which are simulating our neurons using a different architecture that generates a lot of heat. Hence, there is a move to develop specialized hardware using a neural architecture as opposed to the traditional Von Neumann architecture. If this becomes a reality a decade from now, we will be able to do a lot more with neural networks than we can now. Not only does a neural network need to be good at its task, it should also be energy efficient. There is a lot of scare-mongering around AI. What is your perspective on this issue? People are driven a lot by what they see in movies. Part of the common person’s concern is around the Frankenstein that will do nasty things. The fact is that AI is beginning to work in very specialized tasks like controlling an airplane or driving your car. It’s hard to think of any general AI machine that can do all of these tasks in unison—clearly something that humans excel at. As far as AI machines are concerned, this is certainly not on the horizon for at least the next 15-20 years. This scare is unfounded. But the fear that certain types of jobs will vanish because AI (software bots and machines) will do it more efficiently is genuine. Policy makers should prepare themselves for this, and proactively retrain and reskill the people who will be affected to help them cope better with the situation.

Crunch Network Energy is the new new internet Posted Jan 22, 2017 by Brian Lakamp 0 SHARES Next Story Let’s make Series A terms more logical by moving to object-oriented capital Brian Lakamp Crunch Network Contributor Brian Lakamp is co-founder and CEO of Totem. How to join the network If you’re not paying attention to what’s going on in energy, you should. We’ve seen this movie before. Spoiler alert: There’s massive economic opportunity ahead. How massive? Imagine standing in 1992, knowing that Google, Akamai, Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, eBay, BuzzFeed and Uber lay ahead. This time it’s the “enernet,” not the internet, that will transform our lives. The story is the same, though the players have changed. Here’s the tee up. Across the country, incumbent network providers operate highly centralized networks in their respective cities. Then, scrappy local outfits start serving the market with innovative, distributed technology. These startups create competition, and a new network emerges atop the legacy network. That was the backdrop 30 years ago when a little thing called the internet emerged. Startups like CompuServe, AOL, EarthLink, Netcom and a host of other local ISPs kicked off the conversion from analog to digital by offering internet access over existing cable and telco networks. Today, the actors are SolarCity, Sunrun and a host of others moving us off fossil fuels and into clean energy supported by smart equipment, services and software, offered atop existing utility networks. This time, it’s the enernet. Enernet. Noun. A dynamic, distributed, redundant and multi-participant energy network built around clean energy generation, storage and delivery and serving as the foundation for smart cities.  Jigar Shah, founder of SunEdison, seeded the enernet revolution more than a decade ago. He devised a breakthrough financing model that made solar affordable and scalable. He’s the Marc Andreessen of this storyline… seminal, smart and strategic. Today, watch Elon Musk. He presented new solar roof shingles to the world a few months ago. Solar that’s affordable and attractive. Plus, he’s integrating it into a game-changing home system with storage and EV charging. Think the world’s first iPhone. Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, is poised to be an enernet giant, the Amazon of this go-around — margin-challenged in its early years, but set to move. Let’s stop acting surprised, and instead start acting. It goes well beyond Tesla. There is a long list of enernet innovators now emerging. They are building nanogrids, microgrids, distributed energy resources and virtual power plants. They are creating new, intelligent building materials and smart lighting. They are deploying new networks and intelligence that are driving down costs and improving services. At heart, the enernet is the foundation for smart-city tech, including the “Internet of Things,” distributed systems, interconnected backbones and networking technologies, EV-charging services and autonomous vehicles, to name a few. These technologies will drive dramatic change and force us to rethink our cities, municipal services and sectors like transportation, insurance, real estate and financial services. From the enernet evolution will come smart cities that are an order-of-magnitude smarter, healthier and safer. The new network will also present quantum leaps in energy security and emergency resilience that can stand in the face of superstorms or cyberattacks. Hold on to your seats. We’re at the early stages of something immense. Still, I hear the seeds of fear and doubt. There is an oft-cited refrain that the transition will cost a lot and take a long time. That’s absolutely silly. We don’t look back at the internet transformation from analog to digital and think, “Wow, that was slow and cost a ton of money. We should have stuck with the typewriter and landline.” Fact is, it was blazingly fast and driven by those who understood the spend as leveraged investment, not cost center. Likewise, the move to clean energy will seem fast and prudent as solar and energy storage continue to scale, smart cities accelerate and prices continue their fall. I also hear “the utilities are in big trouble.” Let’s not be simplistic. Google didn’t kill Comcast. Comcast is doing just fine. The utilities that own transmission and distribution networks (the wires companies) have enormous value and opportunity ahead. There is no way that the transition happens without the participation of these companies, and there is considerable economic upside ahead for them. Forward-thinking utilities — Consolidated Edison, National Grid and others — see what’s coming and are poised to thrive in the enernet world. Related Articles Apple, Facebook and Google top Greenpeace's clean energy report Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and 18 others commit $1 billion to new cleantech fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures Elon Musk reveals Tesla’s master plan Sure, fossil-fuel generators and suppliers have challenges ahead, just like the content companies were challenged by newer, more flexible, cost-effective content producers. It’ll be up to the management teams at these companies to de-risk the future with intelligent investment and acquisitions. Hats off to folks like David Crane, a visionary who worked to drive that transition at NRG Energy. We will see more of that type of leadership again over the next 10 years as market dynamics shift and outcomes become more obvious and urgent to the incumbents. That said, enernet innovation, like innovation in every other sector, is unlikely to originate from within the incumbents. If you don’t believe me, read books like The Innovator’s Dilemma by Clayton Christensen or this article from Accenture that asserts “corporate innovation does not work.” Unless a Lou Gerstner or Steve Jobs is at the helm of an incumbent, innovation will be acquired, not grown. This backdrop presents incredible opportunity for startups and early investors in the space. I’m excited to be part of that, and I hope that talented entrepreneurs turn their attention from the app economy to the enernet. There’s enormous upside. As I said, we’ve seen this movie. Let’s stop acting surprised, and instead start acting. An economic powerhouse awaits the United States. We’ll be thankful we chose to become a worldwide enernet leader, as this evolution creates a new kind of healthy, robust economy.

Jones Posted 21 Jan 1977 | 12:51 GMT 1. Velodyne Plans a Lidar Megafactory Photo: Business Wire It wasn’t long ago that Google was paying Velodyne $73,000 for each of the automotive lidar units it added to the roofs of its self-driving vehicles. But advances in the technology and the entry of competing lidar makers into the market have combined to put strong downward pressure on prices. Enough that last month, Velodyne claimed a “breakthrough” with a solid-state design that, with mass production, should drop the unit price below $50. Before its competitors can gain too great a foothold in the automotive lidar market, Velodyne is looking to start cranking out a million units a year at a megafactory in San Jose, Calif.   2. Can a Self-Steering Antenna Fix Wi-Fi and TV Reception Issues? CES 2017 won’t be remembered as the moment when a new product category made a big splash. But a few gadget makers caught the attention of techies with ways to sidestep problems with the things we have now. The fact that Wi-Fi that isn’t always there, fast, and reliable is a big enough frustration that two router companies made the final round of the annual “Last Gadget Standing Event”: Ignition Design Labs, with its Portal home Wi-Fi system, and Linksys, with its Velop home mesh network. A third company, antenna designer Ethertronics, suggested yet another approach: an automated antenna optimization technology that can generate multiple radiation patterns from a single antenna and figure out on its own which one to use.   3. “Neural Tourniquet” Zaps a Nerve to Stop Bleeding Scientists have known for a while that, by stimulating a nerve, you can stop tremors of the kind seen in Parkinson’s patients. But what if doctors could stimulate the same nerve to control bleeding? Too fantastical, right? Nope. Researchers have proved it’s possible to stop severe hemorrhaging with neural stimulation. Now, this type of bioelectronic medicine is moving to clinical trials in humans.   4. The Cautionary Tale of "No More Woof," a Crowdfunded Gadget to Read Your Dog's Thoughts When Scandinavian engineers launched their crowdfunding campaign for “No More Woof” in December 2013, they talked a good game. Slip their wearable gadget onto your dog’s head, and it will read the pooch’s doggy brainwaves and translate its mental state into human language. It may not shock you, savvy reader, to learn that the campaign never delivered. What happened? No More Woof shows the particular perils of trying to crowdfund neurotech gadgets. Neurotech is a hot new area for startups, since the gear needed to read out brain patterns and to electrically stimulate the brain only recently became cheap and mobile. And because everybody wants Jedi powers.   5. How Does Geography Figure Into the Full Cost of Electricity? The levelized cost of electricity, or LCOE, helps utilities or governing agencies decide which types of power plants to build. LCOE is the estimated amount of money that it takes for a particular power plant to produce a kilowatt-hour of electricity over its expected lifetime, all other things being equal. But all other things are rarely equal. One of the myriad products churned out by The Full Cost of Electricity (FCe-) study coordinated by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, is a detailed examination of location-based factors such as fuel delivery costs, construction costs, capacity factors, utility rates, financing terms, and other geographically distinct items.

Blackberry BB10 OS is NOT Getting Buried Despite Recent Android Push BlackBerry BB 10 OS won't be buried anytime soon. Alex Thurber, VP Global device sales reels out all that impacts BB 10 OS and BlackBerry itself by Luke Joye • January 22, 2017 January 22, 2017 in BlackBerry BlackBerry BB10 OS not to be buried soon If you were planning to erect a virtual tombstone to mark the end of BlackBerry BB10 OS, BB is not pulling the plug yet, since it has plans to keep it breathing for a longer term. Indeed, it is somewhat curious that after a company decides to discontinue manufacturing products running on its proprietary OS, decides to keep the OS itself alive. After introducing the BB10 in 2013, 2016 was the first full year when it was not used on any of the BB phones. In turn, this paradox gives the feeling that BlackBerryBB10 OS is only perhaps waiting for its natural death. But, executives at BB are quick with a different view. ADVERTISEMENT As at the end of the third quarter of 2016, BB’s market share dipped to a mere 0.1% globally. However, the company’s Android devices performed better. In the midst of this dismal performance and recent positive vibes on ‘Mercury’, the device yet to be launched by BB, as well as BB10 lacking the future hardware, Senior VP at BB for Global device sales, Alex Thurber spoke on future plans for BB10. BlackBerry BB10 OS Chugging along Not surprisingly, Thurber affirmed that BlackBerry continues to be invested in BB10. After a prolonged wait, version 10.3.3 was released by BB in December last and version 10.3.4 appears to be in the works though there is no confirmation to that effect. In government and enterprise segment, BlackBerry BB10 OS has a strong fan base, apart from consumers in specific markets. Thurber stated that he is keen to ensure BB’s users and customers do not get the feel that continuing support for BB10 is not forthcoming because BlackBerry BB10 OS is not receiving any fresh investment. Because BlackBerry is not releasing any of the numbers these days, there is no clarity on what ‘millions of users’ claimed by the company for the OS, truly represents. What we do know however is the absence of app support that has dogged the OS right from its start has been one among the reasons that caused the tailspin for BB10. Recently, WhatsApp had decided to cease supporting BlackBerry BB10 OS  from end 2016 but changed the heart to announce a continuation till 30th June 2017. Earlier, FaceBook ceased extending support and so did MyAccount app from Telus’.  Thurber, however, reiterated the disappointment of BB on the initial decision of WhatsApp and BB executives were now happy with the extension. Yet, the exodus caused by the app support remains a key factor surrounding BB10 which is beyond the company’s control. Thurber added that the issue is out of BB’s hands though support for the Hub and the OS is continuing particularly since several users really rely on it and reckon it to be a true messaging device. He also admitted that the development is partly attributable to strategic decisions made some 5 years ago and that has also been partly why Android was added to the company’s portfolio. In turn, he said BB is excited to present the Priv and DTEK series of devices with true BlackBerry security and complete access to Google Play store. It is business strategy – BlackBerry BB10 OS In transitioning to devices with Android base, the implication obviously was that BB10 would either be recast as an enterprise and business platform or killed off in due course of time. With the latter getting public rebuke (this report included), the former might see the light of the day. Thurber adds that the partnership entered with TCL recently represents a licensing agreement where TCL will manufacture devices under the BlackBerry brand, and the key tenet of this deal is that it will cover only Android- based products. In other words, BB10 is not part of the deal. If TCL were not in the picture, then who would be making phones that run on BlackBerry BB10 OS. Thurber has no comments on hypothesis or road maps. Therefore, there is lack of clarity on any other recourse available to BlackBerry.  BB has stopped making Leaps, Passports or Classics and any remaining inventory is presently being sold through BB’s own store, the carriers as well as other retailers in various countries. Thurber adds that BlackBerry is the singular manufacturer other than Google that is committed to monthly updates across the company’s product line. The first licensing deal that BB entered was with “BB Merah Putih” in Indonesia which is a joint venture between PT Tiphone and BlackBerry. This deal could give us a clue since the agreement confirms that BB Merah Putih would source, distribute and market BlackBerrry products in Indonesia. However, it was not clear immediately whether the arrangement includes manufacturing or if that would be outsourced to third parties. BlackBerry is also reportedly in advanced stages of a licensing arrangement with another Indian company. Either way, when a local vendor in a particular country was willing to take charge and produce the handsets for its indigenous market, that possibly was the type of licensing deals John Chen, the CEO of BlackBerry mentioned when he moved the company away from building captive hardware. Thurber also stated that BB10 continues to be patronized as a real consumer product and that the brand is pretty strong in countries like India, Indonesia, and South Africa. Consumers in many countries have moved towards the demand for app stores and apps and that partly explains why BlackBerry BB10 OS has shifted to traditional users of businesses, enterprises, and governments. Thurber added further that these are some of the company’s strong subset of customers and they do lobby BB for new hardware. These are also developing countries where the users will eventually transition to iOS and Android as has been the experience in developed countries.  On the hypothesis of BB10 merging with Android, one way or the other, or a dual-boot scenario perhaps like the way Apple supported Windows with the Boot Camp software for Intel-based Macs, Thurber stated that it was a significantly more complex task compared to the Boot Camp software. He was also quick to add that these options were examined as a potential, but the project is pretty complex and therefore BB is not pursuing the idea. He also added that plenty of feedbacks on the continuance of BlackBerry BB10 OS on devices other than phones do keep coming in. As and when a promising idea comes up and meets the expectations of customers and also makes sense from the technological perspective, BB will certainly pursue it. This era belongs to Android The fading fortunes of BlackBerry BB10 OS in North America prompted adoption of Android and positioning it as a primary software platform with a layer of BB’s very own unique security as icing on top. The most recent offerings DTEK 50 and 60 came from the TCL stable and have reportedly ‘achieved their selling targets’ though the numbers have not been revealed for the public. The DTEK 50 was pretty much a clone of Idol 4 from the Alcatel brand and targeted primarily at enterprise users and businesses in Western Europe and Canada. In the U.S. it was not offered by any carrier. Like the Priv, the DTEK 60 was more consumer focused. In both the cases, the core selling point was more consistent and robust security for enhanced protection of users from vulnerabilities of the Android. In Government, enterprise and consumers in specific markets around the globe, BlackBerry BB10 OS enjoys a strong following. On regular monthly updates, BB has successfully maintained rolling out the security updates regularly every month as it promised earlier. Thurber also points out that “significant changes” to Linux Kernel as well as Android were made before the companies released the changes to its users of Android-based services. The work on updates for BlackBerry is accomplished by engineers in Ottawa, Ontario, Waterloo and Mississauga facilities and applied to the manufacturing process where each phone is physically touched to inject a crypto-security key before the device is released from the production line.  Thurber also affirmed that immediate plans for releasing DTEK app to devices aside the BlackBerry brand are not in place for now. The indication possibly was the Alcatel line that TCL manufactures. Marketing strategy – BlackBerry BB10 OS BlackBerry has been incessantly criticized for its marketing strategy, or perhaps a lack of it. Thurber completes his first year with BlackBerry in April 2017 and therefore, has not been part of the board in the preceding years. For the same reason, he prefers not to comment on what was done or not done in the past, though he was willing to speak on what should be done going forward. The licensing agreements, he said, should, for one “enhance” the marketing programs, particularly those that are location based.  More importantly, he says that because of the local flavor, the plan and investment strategy devised by the licensing partners will focus on the local market and will be tuned to the needs of that market. Thurber calls this as ‘global consistency with a local flavor’. This is the marketing lingo for campaigns and programs tailored or focused specifically on local markets.  Global campaigns like what has been seen in the past are unlikely to be coming back anytime in the near future. But, in Canada, U.S. and more mature markets, security is at the center of sales angle and the biggest challenge in selling security is that nothing happens when it works, says Thurber. Further, that is not the singular challenge and BYOD (bring your own device) trend that businesses are adopting is not a mere ‘flash in the pan’. Gartner, a market research organization projected in 2013 that 50% of all employers would ask their employees to bring their personal devices for the purpose of work by 2017. A more recent study by the same organization also found that adoption of mobile devices issued by corporate in workplaces is yet to mature. BYOD on one side contributes to an inherent need for security. When you look at the other side, there is the enterprise space offering room for growth which in turn means that many more devices can still go around. If Android takes a bigger share of that space, BlackBerry should grab its share of that pie on the basis of the stated narrative. But, where does that leave BB10? Thurber says that BB is always exploring technologies that are right to bring out its OS. Millions of BB10 users are concerned about highly secure communication and top-speed and BB remains committed to supporting those users. That sums up the state of BB10 for now, and one thing for sure is that at BlackBerry no one is ready yet to chuck dirt in famed BlackBerry BB10 OS.

There is still nothing out there like BlackBerry 10. I use my Nexus 5X now more than my BlackBerry devices thanks to the availability of the BlackBerry Hub suite.

Yet it has gone down by over a factor of 3 since 1876. Searching some old period bands (such as 1820-1840), I saw that the primary use for "erection" had been in the context of erecting a building. However, the current biological meaning existed as well. My guess is that people are using the building-related "erection" a lot less, to avoid unintended sexual connotations. If so, they substitute some other terminology. Either that or we write a lot less, proportionately, about building than we used to. I added "hard-on" to the graph, suspecting it was supplanting "erection", but as the graph shows, it is still relatively insignificant. (It began steady ascent around 1958.) I cannot think of another word likely to be used in books that would be supplanting the biological meaning. BTW, while writing this, I graphed the same ngram, but terminated it at 2016. The slight upward slope has continued steadily since about 1996. It had yet to reach .00040%, though. This may be illustrating what I expected initially, more open attitudes toward sex. etymology ngram share|improve this question edited Jan 22 at 17:44 asked Jan 22 at 17:37 RichF 301111 2   Probably to the same place as Holmes and Watson’s ejaculations have gone to. – tchrist♦ Jan 22 at 17:49 1   If you remove the hyphen the usage of "hard on" is on the up. i.stack.imgur.com/ynu4M.png – Martin Smith Jan 22 at 17:50      I like how you said "experimenting". Anyway, you can use the year-range search links for Google books below the graph. A cursory look suggests that your hunch is right. – Tushar Raj Jan 22 at 17:52 2   If you look at the original Ngram chart, you'll notice two things: there are no matches included for "hard-on" in the "Search in Google Books" results beneath the graph, and the chart bears a banner label reading "Replaced hard-on with hard - on to match how we processed the books." In short, Ngram is not designed to search for hyphenated words, so it's useless for "hard-on." – Sven Yargs Jan 22 at 17:54 1   As a title I would have been tempted with "Why are erections falling?" Is the question in your title? I think you may have answered it yourself. Nowadays writers are avoiding "erected" and "erections" for obvious reasons, and as for tiny number of "hard-on"s , I think you'll find they are being employed elsewhere on the Internet. – Mari-Lou A Jan 22 at 18:59  |  show 12 more comments 1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 3 down vote Tom22 should get credit for this answer. I read his comment awhile ago, but he sounded dismissive of the idea that aroused might be picking up the slack. After just now doing several more comparative graphs, I see that he may well have been onto something. access interactive graph I thought about including "woody" from Martin Smith's graph. My searches, however, indicate that it is relatively rarely used in a sexual sense. Most results relate to wood itself, or the male name (eg. Woody Harrelson). arousal: not significant until around 1950 when it began a significant rise. It began tapering down around 1983, but still maintains more than 2/3 of its peak in 1983. arouse: steady, slow decline during most of the 1900s, with a very recent and small up-slope since about 2002 aroused: huge decline since about 1936, with slight up-slope since about 2002 erection: peak around 1876, followed by steady decline until 1997. It has been slowly ascending since then. hard on: enjoying a slow, almost steady rise since 1820 All the words except arousal have more general meanings. Even "hard on" is most often found in a non-sexual context. (eg, "She worked hard on her job.") Statistics without a known causality can be very misleading. Yet it seems compelling to me that we see the five words together suggest a coalesced sum total of the sexual connotation of erection. What erection, arouse, and aroused may have lost in any sexual connotation sure looks like it has been picked up by arousal. An exception is hard on, changing slowly and maybe gaining more sexual connotation over time, without losing any of the non-sexual usage. (Hardon and hard-on are statistically irrelevant.) share|improve this answer edited Jan 22 at 22:40 answered Jan 22 at 22:32 RichF 301111      You did all the work. I thought I might be on to something but really haven't messed around with the charts enough to do it. You deserve extra points for all the puns too ! – Tom22 Jan 23 at 1:37      @Tom22 Heh, except for the question title, I was not intentionally punning. I've been reminded recently that my sense of humor is not shared universally, so my intent here is to play it straight. Still, I suspect there is an inner 12 year-old (i12yo) in all of us that is all too happy to form connections the author did not intend. That is not to say the author's i12yo did not influence the manner in which he spoke. – RichF Jan 23 at 2:59      I could not help but notice on the graph that almost all expressions show a slight rise after 2000, approximately around the time of the FDA approval of Viagra. I just ran another ngram comparing erection with erectile, as in disfunction, and guess what popped up? A rise in both after 2000. – Cascabel Jan 23 at 4:54      Here is the ngram. – Cascabel Jan 23 at 5:00 add a comment |  Your Answer   draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Jan 23, 2017 - Page 14　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Uber hires Google’s former head of search NY Times News Service, SAN FRANCISCO Uber Technologies Inc and Google Inc have long been bitter rivals in the race to build the autonomous vehicles that appear integral to the future of transportation. Soon, Uber will have a bit of help in that effort from a man who played a key role at Google. Amit Singhal, a 15-year Google veteran and a former senior vice president for search at the company, on Friday said that he planned to join Uber as senior vice president for engineering. At Uber, he will work to build out the software and infrastructure that are the foundation of the company’s ride-hailing services. Singhal will report to Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick and lead the company’s mapping division and a unit that runs the dispatching, marketing and pricing of Uber cars. He will also advise Anthony Levandowski, who runs the company’s self-driving automobile efforts. “It’s hard enough to connect millions of drivers to millions of riders in real time while creating optimal routes for drivers,” Singhal wrote in a post on his personal blog on Friday. “Add to that the twist of predicting real-time traffic, pooling multiple riders and making the system economically attractive for everyone — and now you have one of the most challenging computer science problems I’ve encountered in my 30-year career.” The hiring of Singhal, who left Google last year, is a coup for Uber, which has stated its intention to fight Google’s substantial head start in autonomous-vehicle research. Uber has poached multiple high-level employees from Google over the past seven years, including Levandowski. Early in Uber’s history, it and Google were more allies than enemies. Google highlighted the Uber app in its maps application as a mode of transportation, and GV, the venture capital arm of Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc, has invested hundreds of millions of US dollars in Uber. However, since it became clearer that Uber and Google would compete in the development of self-driving vehicles and in other areas, the companies have grown apart. Google offers a type of carpooling service in the San Francisco area through Waze, a mapping app it owns. And David Drummond, a top Google executive, left his position on the Uber board of directors last year. Singhal’s move to Uber ratchets up the rivalry. Hired by Google in 2000, he was the company’s 176th employee and he rewrote many of the original search algorithms created by the company’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Singhal is credited as one of the engineers who built the smarter and faster search engine that gave Google what proved to be an insurmountable advantage in Web search. When Singhal left his position as Google’s head of search in February last year, he said he planned to focus on philanthropy. “I love Amit’s excitement for solving complex computer science problems and his passion for helping improve people’s lives through technology,” Kalanick said in a statement. “The team at Uber, myself included, will learn a lot from him.” This story has been viewed 3613 times.

In what, by The New York Times account, was a planned and straightforward transfer, Sonos founder John MacFarlane stepped aside to hand the reins to Spence, who came to Sonos four years ago, after a VP stint at BlackBerry. And the new CEO has a new mission: keep the independent company alive and kicking as it faces a wave of disruption coming directly from the biggest technology companies on the planet. Sonos makes home speakers — precisely the space that’s getting upended by Amazon’s Echo and (to a lesser extent so far) Google Home. It’s perhaps not entirely fair to say Sonos was blindsided by the rise of digital assistants in the home; but it is entirely fair to say that the company hasn’t reacted quickly enough to their sudden importance. We’ve obtained a slightly redacted copy of the memo that Spence sent to his company immediately after taking over, and it reveals some of what Sonos is going to do to face those new challenges. Namely: it’s going to try to get everybody to play nice with Sonos. “What got us here won’t alone get us through the next phase.” “We know that life at home requires the support of a variety of services,” Spence writes. And rather than partner with a single company, he says Sonos will work with everybody just like it did with music streaming apps: “We are going to do the same with voice services, bringing all the services that matter to every home.” Sonos is already planning on some integration with Amazon Alexa, but it seems like other services are going to follow — assuming Sonos can somehow remain independent and somehow convince all of these potential partners to share space on its speakers. Spence references this new balance and says Sonos will enter “the big leagues – partnering and competing with global leaders like Amazon, Google and (likely) Apple.” There’s more to Spence’s memo, reproduced below, including a need to have “bias to action” when it comes to dealing with those issues and “more product innovation.” It paints a picture of a CEO that knows exactly what his company needs to do in order to remain both independent and profitable — the trick now is that Spence and Sonos need to get to it, and fast. Team, I am humbled and honored by the opportunity to serve as your CEO. I joined Sonos four and half years ago for two reasons: First, I was a passionate Sonos customer – it changed the way my family and I enjoy music around our home. It was awesome to see my friends sharing their favorite musical memories around our dining room table and to see my two kids dancing their hearts out in the kitchen. Our company matters because music matters, and bringing that into more homes matters more than ever. The second reason I joined was because of the people. The first person I met was John, and he was even more wonderful than the product. And then I got to meet the talented team and was blown away. Every day I leave work inspired by the passion and ideas I see from all of you. My passion for why we're here, for what we build, and my love for all of you has only grown over that time. For these reasons, taking on the CEO role is incredibly exciting, and I’m all in. I’d like thank John for his leadership in bringing Sonos from an idea to a company of more than 1,300 people that has filled millions of homes with music. He’s done it by leading with clear mission and strong set of values. He has taught us what is possible when all of us show up every day ready to pursue our mission and carry out those values. John is a special entrepreneur, and one of the most selfless and high integrity people I know. We will build on this great foundation and relentlessly pursue the mission he set the company on fifteen years ago. With the full arrival of streaming, the advent of voice, and the promise of the connected home, we are at a pivotal and defining moment – this is our time. The next few years will define our future as we step into the big leagues – partnering and competing with global leaders like Amazon, Google and (likely) Apple. It requires new thinking and a different pace than we had in our first fifteen years. We know that life at home requires the support of a variety of services since each family member has their own preferences. We have already proven the ability to do this in an elegant and reliable way with music services. We are going to do the same with voice services, bringing all the services that matter to every home. This, combined with our strength and breadth in music streaming services, our commitment to building a software platform that partners can easily build on, our variety of awesome products that fit every room (vs. a one-size-fits-all approach), and sound quality that makes music come alive unlike anyone else, sets us up for a strong future. We must challenge ourselves to stay ahead of the curve. Being great doesn’t always require being first, but when it comes to the home music experience, we must be the pioneer. More companies are jumping into our space because they see the big opportunity ahead. What got us here won’t alone get us through the next phase. Given this, there are two important areas we need to evolve: First, we must have a bias towards action. You are all talented and bring diverse perspectives. You have ideas. Please share them freely – especially before they’re “perfect.” Take a risk and share them with others. Listen to the new ideas of your colleagues with the goal of learning about what could be, and help them make them better. Apply yourself to putting ideas into action and being nimble enough to adjust along the way. The pace in which we do this must be faster than the rate of change in the world, and the world is getting a lot faster. Second, we must innovate boldly. When Sonos began, it was all about product innovation– and while we need more product innovation and pace than ever, we also need to expand our innovative thinking to the way we market to customers, the way we sell to customers, and the way we service customers. We need to be bold about where we believe the world should go, and then we need to lead it there. I’m fired up to go after the opportunity in front of us, and bring the joy of Sonos to millions of new homes. I look forward to doing it together with all of you.

This Writer Plans To Stop The White House By Publishing Lies By Kasia Kovacs @kasiakovacs On 01/22/17 AT 8:20 AM Close Paul Horner, the man known for his sham articles that spread across the internet, has published his latest story: “Twitter Deletes Donald Trump’s Twitter Account: ‘We Will Not Tolerate Racism and Hate.’” The site cnn.com.de also features articles about President Barack Obama banning the national anthem and declaring September National Muslim Appreciation Month. These reports, like all of the stories written and published by Horner, a 38-year-old writer of satire and fake news, are bogus. Twitter is not deleting President Donald Trump’s account. Obama has not banned the national anthem. There isn't a federally mandated month dedicated to Muslims. And the website that hosts these stories, cnn.com.de, is not affiliated with CNN. Amid a national conversation about fake news and how such stories influence public opinion, Horner became famous online after Election Day for claiming his fabricated reports helped turn voters against Democrat Hillary Clinton. With the former business mogul now in power, Horner wants to use fake news -- or "shenanigans," the term he prefers -- to take down the president. He's convinced that his writing has a purpose: to use false information to give people the truth. Interest in fake news rose dramatically around the time of the U.S. presidential election, when the campaign between Trump and his equally unpopular rival, Hillary Clinton, saw fabricated stories mushroom on social media. Google searches spiked from the last week of October to the second week of November. Since then, the term “fake news” has been regurgitated and debated by lawmakers, academics, journalists and other Americans. Horner told the Washington Post in November he was afraid his stories helped put Trump into the White House, and his notoriety was exacerbated when he said Trump supporters were naïve.  A screenshot of Paul Horner from an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, December 13, 2016. Photo: CNN.com Horner began receiving hate messages calling him scum after the interview. He stepped back from publishing his fake news stories, keeping a low-key profile on his hoax news sites for the next month. In January, he began writing once more, this time with a new approach. His story about Twitter deleting Trump’s account is filled with fabricated quotes. The journalist who supposedly wrote the story -- Jimmy Rustling, who has Pulitzers, a mail-order bride and an adopted Syrian daughter, according to his online biography -- does not exist. It's the pseudonym Horner uses for his fake CNN site. Horner's story leans heavily on hyperpartisan anti-Trump rhetoric. Trump, according to the story, appointed a climate change denier as head of the Environmental Protection Agency (perhaps skeptic is a more accurate term, as Scott Pruitt has admitted that the climate is changing, although he said the extent to which human activity causes that change is debatable) and a person who “doesn’t believe in public education” in charge of the Education Department (Betsy DeVos has criticized the way public education operates, but she hasn’t said she wants to do away with the system entirely). Yet throughout the piece, Horner also references and links to several stories from reputable media outlets such as The New York Times, Time Magazine and Vanity Fair. This tactic is markedly different from many of his previous political hoax news pieces, which were mainly crafted from his imagination. The goal is to lure people in with a false, clickbait title -- “Twitter Deletes Trump’s Twitter Account” has gotten over a million views, Horner said -- and then offer them persuasive facts in the story. “It gets that person that’s a follower of TMZ -- people that don’t follow anything political or know anything really that’s going on, they just know Donald Trump is our next president… it gets the person who will read that story (to) pretty much (be) forced to learn about everything that’s negative about Trump,” Horner said. If the comments on the story are any indication, however, not everyone is getting the message. "Cnn and the rest of the liberal media are just scared Trump can communicate directly with the American peole and does not need the media or that they cant control the narrative. They are trying to silence his 1st amendment the most un-american thing they can do," one visitor to the site wrote. Horner, who lives in Phoenix, is used to juggling multiple tasks at once. He spoke with IBT over the phone while heading to a Safeway grocery store in an Uber. After the driver seemed to become confused with directions and took a few wrong turns, Horner canceled the ride and left the car.  “Oh my god, what was wrong with that f*cking guy?” he said. And then: “Sorry about that … I’m walking back to my apartment right now. Let’s do this again.” Writing hoax stories may be lucrative -- $10,000 a month through Google’s AdSense program, he said -- but it’s not all he does. He also deals in online day trading. He tries his hand at stand-up comedy. He writes for his online journal. And he runs the charity Sock It Forward, which he plugs in many of his fake news stories. Horner takes pride in his work, differentiating himself from “crap” fake news sites, he said. “I could write a story right now about Paul McCartney from The Beatles dying, and it would go viral, and it would make $10,000 in ad revenue,” Horner said. “But there’s no purpose, it’s morally wrong. That’s why I don’t do it.” It's that same moral code that guided Horner when he published a story called “The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory” in October. “The purpose of the story was to try to get Trump supporters not to go out and vote, thinking that they didn’t have to vote now because the Amish had locked up the vote,” Horner said. After the election, he “started thinking maybe that story helped him get elected.” But some of his articles seem to have no purpose at all. Another one of his recent stories carried this headline: “Police Officer On LSD Attempts To Save Anti-Masturbation Dolphin Mascot From Imaginary Fire.” The fact is, fake news has been around for at least hundreds of years. In the 15th century, a priest in Italy spread rumors that Jews murdered a Christian toddler, drained his blood and drank it to celebrate Passover. And then there’s the Spanish-American War. Just over 100 years ago, the U.S. found itself in a military conflict thanks to two news empires driven by sensationalism.  Media critics today debate about what falls under the umbrella of fake news. Is it total fabrication to get clicks and money? Conspiracy theories on message boards? What about reports with questionable information (see BuzzFeed’s Golden Showers scoop), or selecting certain facts in news stories while intentionally ignoring others? Some critics now cry “fake news!” over facts they simply disagree with.    All of that is further complicated by the online infrastructure that directs how falsities are spread, which is often through Facebook and Twitter. Since the “fake news” news exploded in November, Facebook and Google both announced measures to try and curb stories that peddle false information. Google, for instance, has pledged to ban fake news sites from AdSense, its advertising service. “The most critical way to counter fake news now is (for the press) to be extremely skeptical when confronting Trump,” said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, a non-profit, progressive watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Louis Jacobson, senior correspondent for fack-checking site PolitiFact, went even further, arguing that no real progress will come unless other systems are changed. “We and other fact checkers are working with Facebook to check and label questionable, widely shared posts,” Jacobson said. “I hope this proves valuable, but we're just starting, so it's too soon to know. The other solutions to this problem, such as better education of students about critical thinking, are only going to occur over the longer term.” Horner, for his part, said he supports efforts to curb false information.

Amazon moves up four spots to round out the top five. Netflix and Facebook join the top 10 for the first time, moving up 15 and 19 spots respectively. This year's list is a global group: 34 companies on the list are from the US, 10 are from Europe, and six from Asia. This regional mix represents a significant shift toward North American companies, which capture 68 per cent of the top 50, up from 44 per cent in 2013. BCG has surveyed more than 1,500 senior innovation executives—across a wide range of countries and industries— 11 times since 2004 to cast light on the state of innovation in business. In its new report, The Most Innovative Companies 2016: Getting Past “Not Invented Here,” the firm reveals the 50 companies that global innovation executives ranked as the most innovative and explores the increasing imperative for companies to bring in innovations from outside. “Given faster-changing markets—and the fact that even in more traditional sectors technology is becoming a key differentiator—a not-invented-here mindset can be fatal,” said BCG partner and report coauthor Andrew Taylor. “Today’s most successful innovators strike a strategic balance between internal and external innovation. They are smart and efficient at scanning for external ideas—and deft at bringing them inside.” The research finds a gap between the strongest innovators and their weaker peers in the pursuit of external ideas. Strong innovators take a more analytical approach, with 65 per cent reporting they find new ideas through social network and big data mining (compared with just 14 per cent for weak innovators). Strong innovators are also flexible in how they bring in innovations. For example, 66 per cent say that they find new ideas through external partnerships often or very often (versus just 22 per cent for weak innovators). According to BCG partner and report coauthor Michael Ringel: “We see innovators increasingly embracing advanced analytics to spot key technologies to license and targets for acquisition and partnership—allowing them to shorten development cycles and outrun competitors.” Companies seeking to tap the benefits of external innovation use a range of techniques, both structural and cultural, to bring outside ideas inside. “Leading innovators combat the not-invented-here mindset through structure and culture,” said BCG partner and report coauthor Hadi Zablit. “They complement traditional vehicles like joint ventures with newer approaches like corporate venture capital and incubators—and through incentives and leadership they foster a more outward-looking culture.” The data supports this point of view. For example, among strong innovators, 62 per cent use incubators (versus only 13 per cent of weak). And 80 per cent of strong innovators report their organization is open and collaborative (versus 22 per cent of weak). The report also features in-depth stories of companies that are rising to the external innovation challenge: • How Under Armour, a new entrant on the list, at number 22, has leveraged a mix of internal and external innovation to generate a 42.5 per cent total shareholder return from 2011 through 2015. • How Johnson & Johnson, number 29 on the list, structures itself to recognize and reward innovation no matter where it originates. • How Brooks Automation used innovation analytics to identify a major adjacent market opportunity that now represents 20 per cent of the company’s revenue and offers significant room to grow. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: Companies | innovative | List | BCG | More Miscellaneous Stories Dewa moves up on happiness index Sheikh Mohammed launches Customers’ Happiness Factory Investment opportunities in Bahrain highlighted Engie backs Emirates Electric Vehicle Road Trip Public transport boost for Muscat Burj Khalifa to be lit with Indian tricolour BravoSolution Tejari to host procurement industry leaders Dubai launches new classification system for SMEs Abu Dhabi Crown Prince in India on 3-day visit Dial-A-Battery celebrates 5 years with additional services Abu Dhabi to host 2019 Special Olympics Abu Dhabi conference to tackle Mena food issues Dubai's Moral Machine throws up some surprises at Davos Two terror suspects killed in Jeddah anti-terror raids MEA to spearhead $2.2trn packaged food industry growth Masdar partners with Thales for hybrid airship Ramada Ajman to improve food waste management UAE releases report with 112 predictions at Davos UAE video surveillance market to hit $200m by 2021 Bahrain Award for Entrepreneurship enters quarter finals stage Clifford Chance ME team puts focus on Africa projects Dubai Culture appoints CEO of happiness Expo 2020 Dubai rolls out $100m scheme for creative projects Qatar cabinet approves new regulation on residency law Alison Nelson’s Chocolate Bar opens in Bahrain Seafood Market to celebrate 24 years of success New Belgium visa centre opens in Abu Dhabi Ebrahim K Kanoo sponsors Japan National Day reception Mena food output focus for Abu Dhabi summit Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

They have announced that the legacy version of Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides will be shutting down by April 3 this year, so maybe it’s time to update to the latest version if you still haven’t done it for some reason. The web version of Google Calendar meanwhile has gotten an update to catch up with some of the Android features. If you’re still on a legacy version of the apps, then you will receive a prompt when you open your app, which says “Version too old” and then by March 1, some of these users will be forced to upgrade already or else they won’t be able to use the app anymore. The good news is that the web and desktop applications will not be affected, although it is almost always a good idea to upgrade to the latest version anyway. Meanwhile, the web version of Google Calendar will receive an update so that it will have the features that the Android app previously received. When you create meetings, it will make suggestions as to where you can have it based on the previous rooms that you’ve used. And if you work with people who are on different time zones, you will have the “Find a Time” option which will show you where all the time zones of the participants are so you can find the most convenient time for all. If you don’t know what version your app is, you can always find it in your settings menu. If we were you, we won’t wait until April 3 or even March 1 and just update it now to save you from all the hassle later on.

TECHNOLOGY Beware This New Gmail Scam That Is Tricking Even Tech-Savvy Users Here is what you need to know in order to stay safe from a new, sophisticated phishing attack. By Joseph Steinberg Joseph Steinberg is a cybersecurity expert and entrepreneur. He is CEO of SecureMySocial, which recently brought to market the world's first system to warn people in real time if they are making inappropriate social media posts. He is also the inventor of several popular cybersecurity technologies, and the author of books and articles on information security and business-related topics. Full bio: www.JosephSteinberg.com @JosephSteinberg CEO, SecureMySocial@JosephSteinberg 1 COMMENTS CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Hackers have launched a new phishing attack that is tricking even tech-savvy users. Here is what you need to know in order to protect yourself. The attack works like this: Hackers who have breached someone's email account look through the emails in it for correspondence containing attachments. They then send emails from the compromised account -- impersonating the account's owner -- with each email leveraging similarities to prior correspondence, so as to make the new messages seem legitimate and familiar. For example, the phishing emails may use a subject line that was used in the past. The hackers embed an image of an attachment used in the past into each phishing email, but configure the image to open not the attachment but, rather, a phishing page that looks like a Google login. Because the user is opening a Gmail attachment, the presentation of a phony Gmail login page does not seem alarming -- especially when the person opening the attachment feels that he or she has been viewing a "safe and familiar" correspondence. Of course, once the new victim enters credentials into the phony Google login page the criminals utilize them to access their victim's account. The attack has likely been going on for about a year with increasing intensity. How can you stay safe? Always think twice before entering login credentials -- ask yourself why you are being asked for them. If you are already reading Gmail, why all of a sudden are you being asked for your Gmail credentials? Do not log in to sites via log-in pages generated by clicking links. For any site on which you will enter sensitive information, always reach it by entering its URL into the Web browser. To get the attachment to open a phony Google login page, hackers use a data:text URL -- beginning something like "data:text/html,https://accounts.google.com/." While that may appear to be related to Google, any URL that starts data:text is not a link to a website but rather content to be displayed locally. Never enter passwords or other sensitive information into any webpage with a data:text URL. Enable multi-factor authentication. If somehow you fall prey to a Gmail phsihing attack and give criminals your log-in name and password, multi-factor authentication will continue to protect your account. Without access to your phone, for example, criminals would be unlikely to be able to access your email even if they know your password. Businesses worried about similar types of attacks should consider deploying anti-phishing technology. Green Armor's Identity Cues (which I co-invented), for example, helps ensure that a real log-in page looks different for every user and can only be generated by legitimate Web servers. Technology of that sort would make it obvious to users -- consciously or subconsciously -- that the bogus log-in page is illegitimate. Do not rely on warnings by Web browsers: The red warning used on insecure web pages, the certificate warnings used for invalid certificates, and the "unsafe site" message may not appear for data:text URLs. (Web browser companies should change this -- any data URL should display a warning.) What do others in the information security industry have to say about the Gmail scam? John Gunn, VP of communications, VASCO Data Security "As attack methods become more sophisticated -- as this attack demonstrates -- defenses must keep pace or the number of victims will continue to grow. Passwords are 30-year old technology and they merely provide a false sense of security with no real protection. 2017 must be the year that the industry replaces passwords with multi-factor authentication." Christian Lees, CISO, InfoArmor "Threat actors have extreme creativity and time in their favor when it comes to the never-ending campaigns available to compromise user accounts. Applying several layers of security -- much like enterprise organizations commonly use today -- is not difficult to achieve. It requires: 1) Utilizing modern identity theft monitoring programs that enable users to monitor for breached credentials that likely offer threat actors passage into the compromised account, allowing them to quickly change credentials; and 2) Enabling two-factor authentication to detour the threat actor's access into the compromised account. This step additionally safeguards unsuspecting victims that may spawn from the compromised account." Balázs Scheidler, co-founder and CTO, Balabit "Phishing techniques are improving and can be so elaborate that they can scam even tech-savvy people such as privileged users, who have access to sensitive corporate assets. Should such an account be compromised, attackers can cause a lot of damage. Clearly, holding the credential for an account may not be enough to ensure that the logged-in user is indeed the legitimate user. The actual user's behavior is the one thing that helps security professionals discover misused accounts by automatically spotting behavioral differences between an intruder and a legitimate user's baseline. Behavior analytics can identify exactly those cases where malicious actors use stolen credentials, and can prevent resulting data breaches." Bert Rankin, CMO, Lastline "Unfortunately, constantly evolving and improving phishing attacks are now a way of online life for all of us. For those enterprise IT administrators with the mission of protecting the organization, educating employees is not enough. It can sometimes take just one accidental, well-meaning click on a malicious email to inflict irreversible damage to the whole organization. In addition to employee education and awareness about how phishing attacks work and how to identify a suspicious email, it is an imperative that IT put filtering mechanisms in place that use technology -- not people -- to sort, test and eliminate such malicious emails before they even have a chance to test the eyes of the employees." Jeff Hill, director of product management, Prevalent "Today's disturbing reality is that there is no effective defense for a well-conceived phishing attack. Reliance on email communication, the sheer volume of it, and the frenetic pace of life combine to create a superbly fertile environment for cyber attackers to exploit. The challenge is to detect the intrusion quickly after the inevitably successful phishing attack, shut it down, and make it very difficult for bad actors to access sensitive information in the interim even if they gain access the network."

If anything, this utility showcases one of the interesting ways game development and virtual reality can overlap as technology evolves. Google simultaneously announced and released the free utility on its official blog today while also sharing a few examples of games and animated projects that can now be made in Unity using artwork imported from Tilt Brush.

However, few give thought to disposing their old phones in the proper manner, exposing themselves to data theft. “Today, mobile devices store far more sensitive data than users realize, often more than their personal computers,” says Ned Baltagi, Managing Director, Middle East & Africa at SANS. “This information can include where they live, work and the places they visit frequently, contact information for their friends, family and co-workers, messages, web-browsing history, personal photos, cloud storage and email; and even stored passwords and access to highly sensitive services such as online banking.” If you’re planning to replace your phone by donating it, exchanging it for a new one, giving it to another family member, reselling it, or even throwing it out, you need to first make sure that you erase all the sensitive data. According to SANS Institute, here are the most important steps to safely dispose your mobile phone: 1. Wipe the device: Simply deleting data is not enough because anyone can recover it. Instead, you need to ‘wipe’ your phone to make it unrecoverable. The easiest way is to use the “factory-reset” feature. wiping-out-data-from-android-phone-1png.jpg (84K) 2. Get rid of SIMs or external memory cards: In addition to storing data on the device itself, smartphones tend to save some information on the SIM which is not wiped out by the factory reset. It’s best to physically shred or destroy the card to prevent it from being reused. Many smartphones support external memory cards. Over time, these cards accumulate information such as pictures, application data, and other sensitive content       Source Tags: Mobile Phones | mobiles | personal data | Smartphones | Technology Web Desk Website Previous ArticlePakistani makeup artist Samina Akram wins international award Next Article Govt to introduce smart boards in schools Related Stories iPhone users can now use WhatsApp ‘without Internet’ Over 2,000 Warid, LDN, BCS Employees Offered Permanent Jobs at Jazz Pakistan Internet Exchange Inaugurated in Islamabad Leave A Reply Cancel Reply Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Website (optional) Connect with Us 2901followers 42582likes 43followers You Might Also Like CTD gets 4G system to trace smartphone calls across Sindh KARACHI: The Sindh police have finally acquired the multimillion-rupee 4G mobile phone call locator system, ...read more These Samsung Phones Will Receive the Android 7.0 Nougat Update Samsung is finally making good on its promise of latest software updates on its phones. The ...read more Samsung Electronics to reveal Galaxy Note 7 probe results this month Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will announce this month the results of an investigation into what ...read more Recent Posts 0 January 27, 2017 iPhone users can now use WhatsApp ‘without Internet’ 2 January 27, 2017 Over 2,000 Warid, LDN, BCS Employees Offered Permanent Jobs at Jazz 0 January 27, 2017 Pakistan Internet Exchange Inaugurated in Islamabad Popular Post August 18, 2013 Pakistan Cruise Missiles Vs India Ballistic Missile Defense July 15, 2014 Ajit Doval: The Indian who wants to ‘destroy’ Pakistan?

Globally, property portals are extremely profitable businesses. The international property portal market leaders -- and a window to the future -- are in the U.K. and Australia. Get Inman via Facebook Messenger Our top headlines delivered once a day. by CareyBot Many Americans, myself included, tend to think that the U.S. is the leader when it comes to online businesses. With established tech giants like Google and Microsoft and emerging players like Uber and Airbnb, we can’t be blamed for thinking the U.S. is the home of online. But this is not the case for my area of specialization, online property portals. The market leader in the U.S. is Zillow Group, but what may come as a surprise to many is that it is not the global leader in the space. In fact, the U.S. market is significantly behind other markets like the U.K. and Australia when it comes to business model maturity. It is not my intention to disparage Zillow. My point is to properly place them in a broader international context, and to acknowledge that they (and the U.S.) are not market leaders in this space. Comparison on a global stage I included the following financial snapshot in my previous article on the investment and acquisition strategies of the major property portals around the world: Subsequently, I asked the rhetorical question, “Why is Zillow so far behind in terms of profitability?” That’s exactly what I decided to take a look at today by digging deeper into a few areas of comparison. The profitability question Zillow Group has the highest revenues of the major property portals around the world, but significantly lags in profitability. In fact, on a standard cash-in/cash-out basis, they are not profitable. I prefer to look at full year results, as it’s a longer time period and presents a more complete picture than quarterly results. In 2015, its last full financial year, Zillow reported revenues of $644 million and expenses of $794 million. In other words, they only collected $81 for every $100 spent. Rightmove, the market leader in the U.K., collects $350 for every $100 spent. It is an exceedingly profitable business. And I’m not just cherry picking by comparing Zillow to Rightmove. For every $100 spent, REA Group in Australia collects $266, Trade Me in New Zealand collects $277 and Zoopla in the U.K. collects $183. These are all profitable businesses that represent a positive return on investment. So why is Zillow lagging so far behind? Revenue growth The U.S. market is significantly bigger than the U.K. and Australia. So perhaps Zillow is just earlier on the growth curve, right? Let’s take a look. Again, based on the last full year’s financial results, Zillow’s pro forma revenue (which reasonably includes Trulia) grew by 18 percent, compared to Rightmove’s 15 percent and REA Group’s 17 percent (for their Australian operations only; total group was 20 percent). So on that basis, the growth curves are not wildly different at all. But if you go more granular and dig into Zillow’s last six quarters, you get a different picture of accelerating revenue growth. The real test will be to look at the company’s full 2016 financial results. On a full year basis, it is are basically growing at the same rate as the other big international portals. But its recent quarterly results suggest faster growth in 2016. Employee count Another aspect to look at is the average revenue per employee. At last count, Zillow employed around 2,500 people compared to around 400 at Rightmove. That’s about $260k/employee at Zillow compared to $600k/employee at Rightmove. If Zillow were to achieve the same level of efficiency by doubling their revenues on the same cost basis (extremely unlikely), they would be collecting $162 for every $100 spent — a big improvement! Monetising their customers One last area to examine is the monthly average revenue per advertiser (ARPA) — effectively, how much their customers pay for their services. It’s difficult to get matching time periods, but here are the most recently reported ARPA numbers for Zillow, Rightmove and REA Group in the 2015/2016 timeframe. Clearly, the international portals are able to better monetize their services than Zillow. I would argue this is a factor of business model maturity. All markets have significant competitive tension. In Australia, REA Group greatly benefits from a vendor-funded marketing environment (where home sellers pay for marketing directly). But clearly, Rightmove and REA Group simply have more experience and expertise around monetization. Followers, not leaders Many people don’t realize that the U.S. is behind in the property portal space. Zillow is not on the leading edge. The clear market leaders are not in the U.S., but the U.K. and Australia, and there is a lot we can — and should — learn from them!

Skip to content Home News Features Opinions Support Search for: The Stanford Review A Reading Deficit Take fewer classes, read more books. Finals are in full swing. Google Calendars are filled with a hodgepodge of overlapping colored events. Professors lectured to empty classrooms during dead week as students studied in their dorms and regretted signing up for 20 units. Throughout the quarter, a desire to succeed and fear of falling behind pushes Stanford students to sign up for more classes than they can handle. Amid all this stress, students leave out free time for reading. Part of this neglect is understandable. Many students grew up in a structured environment in which constantly attending classes and extracurricular activities was routine. The few empty spaces left on calendars soon are filled with events labeled “Dinner with friend” of “Office hours” as students try to balance their social and academic lives. But, among those colored blocks, there is no time devoted to reading. While most people agree that reading is valuable, they don’t realize that reading is an investment that can also save them time. Unlike online articles, which can be written quickly and published without any peer review, books will be reviewed by respected publications, experts in the field, and its readers. Furthermore, the fact that authors have several hundred pages rather than a few mouse scrolls to explain their arguments forces thoughtfulness and detail. As a result, a single book can efficiently replace many ten-week social science classes such as economic theory and psychology, and even business classes such as marketing and design. Best of all, instead of waiting until a particular quarter to take a class, you can learn the material immediately through books. Consider the 5-unit class ECON 178: Behavioral Economics. According to Carta, the time commitment for the class averages to 9.67 hours a week or 96.7 hours total. (For simplicity, we’re assuming 20 hours for the 5% of students who surveyed >15 hours.) In comparison, reading a text that covers similar material, the 500-page Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, would take about 20 hours (which is a fairly generous estimate). In addition to taking less time, Thinking Fast and Slow is an extremely dense book that includes much research beyond the scope of the class. Students can save so much time from reading that they can maximize their time at Stanford by primarily taking classes that can’t be replaced by books — usually those including problem sets and programming assignments, or experiential classes such as peer counseling and social dance. Some might argue that group discussions with world-renowned faculty make classes with required readings valuable. In theory, they may be right.  But in practice, discussions — and the individual leading them — can vary highly in quality. Some lead to valuable insights, while others digress along tangents. Often, a desire for a high class participation grade incentivizes students to value quantity over quality. The first student to respond to the discussion leader usually answers most of the question. Others often resort to rephrasing the first person’s comments to fulfill the participation requirement. Instead of class discussions, why not read books and come up with a list of questions to ask the smartest people in the field? One of the greatest privileges of being a Stanford student is that successful people are surprisingly willing to have one-on-one conversations. Of course, since meeting people just for its own sake can be a waste of time for both participants, books can provide talking points to learn about a specific subject and test your own conclusions in a conversation. As Ray Dalio writes in Principles, “I [stress-test] my opinions by having the smartest people I [can] find challenge them so I [can] figure out where I [am] wrong.” Likewise, Stanford students are obsessed with finding and following their passions. Testing their ideas with leaders would help them quickly improve and determine what matters to them and why. Reading and these one-on-one discussions could also expose students to a diversity of viewpoints; the election of Donald Trump showed us the dangers of living in an echo chamber and why both conservatives and liberals need to be open to others’ thoughts. Even outside of politics, lack of reading can contribute to the decline of intellectual vitality, which is ironically one of the criteria the university uses to examine its applicants, among Stanford students. Without new information, students seem to fall back onto the worldviews of their peers instead of researching the issue for themselves and forming original opinions. Intellectual discussions thrive when both parties have read material on the subject and are confident enough through all the knowledge they’ve gained through reading to share their opinions. Complex, nuanced discussions, such as the tradeoff between privacy and transparency, take a back seat to surface-level conversations about how hard the last problem set was or how someone’s doing with internship recruiting. But most importantly, reading helps us make better decisions, in whatever field we pursue. Engineering students, for example, are often the last line of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices in an economy that has become information-, not industry-, based. Incidents, such as the FBI-Apple encryption dispute, illustrate that engineers must be well-read about the implications of technology on policy and society. As The Sovereign Individual explains, “The instantaneous sharing of information will be like a solvent dissolving large institutions. It will radically alter information and transaction costs that determine how businesses organize and the way the economy functions.” It’s essential that Stanford students studying artificial intelligence read and discuss AI safety and how self-driving cars will affect truck drivers, the most common job in America, so that they are able to make the best decision for all parties involved. To paraphrase entrepreneur and writer Jon Westenberg, what we call following our gut is really every piece of information we’ve ever consumed subconsciously guiding us, shaping our ideas and instincts. Since books condense life experiences, including overcoming failures, into a few hundred pages, their lessons can help us avoid costly mistakes early on, whether leading student groups or forming relationships. Biographies, especially, give ambitious students a reference point for achievement by showing the decisions that Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and others made during their early years. Most of these invaluable lessons cannot be taught inside a Gates lecture hall. And while we can read at any point in our lives, only in these four years will we have the free time to decide how to live our lives and what to prioritize. Timing matters — we are in our most formative years, one of the most important times to read widely. If you care about having a unique, meaningful, and impactful life, then take the time to consider what intrinsically drives you instead of trying to achieve standards others think you should achieve. So instead of signing up for that last 5 units next quarter, leave some time to read books. by Richard Chen on December 15, 2016December 15, 2016 Features Post navigation All Right Now? Stanford Band Silenced Stanford Band Suspension: Not an Arbitrary Act of Tyranny Reader The notion that these four years are so vital to one’s intellectual vitality and life choices in this article borders on the hysterical. You have your whole life to read, but more importantly, you have your whole life to amend your views and even shift a career path. These four years are not final. As such, the 96.7 > 20 hour argument isn’t sufficiently compelling: you reduce education to transmission of information. A classroom, when managed properly, allows for far more than that. Moreover, taking extra classes often offers (especially freshman and sophomores) students a glimpse of another field. Sure, this could be earned from a book on the same subject, but the enthusiasm of the professor or the vibrancy of one’s peers is oftentimes enough to make someone fall in love with a new subject, or at least become mildly perked. You have four years to learn from some of the best professors and engage with some of the best students: those books aren’t leaving their shelves anytime soon. Also, the overall premise that coursework and reading are somehow distinct is baffling. “A single book can efficiently replace many ten-week social science classes such as economic theory and psychology, and even business classes such as marketing and design.” Sure, if the course is terribly instructed–but don’t most courses instead supplement their learning with these books? Reading and classes are not mutually exclusive. Finally, this article neglects different learning styles: ever consider the fact that many students might prefer visual or auditory learning? Or maybe interactive learning? Or even classic group-work learning? Ultimately, this was a great read and I thank you for writing it. A loss of intellectual vitality would be bad, and busy schedules often leave little to no space for reading, which is a shame. But to dismiss every other aspect of the academic environment and to ridicule your peers to the point of complete unoriginality (“fall back on others’ worldview”) is to be blind to the Stanford community.

And while double-digit daily meetings may not be ideal, every marketing leader could stand to manage meeting time more effectively. To wit, nearly two-thirds of marketers said that “wasteful” meetings hurt their productivity rate, according to a recent report by Workfront (PDF). “Meetings facilitate collaboration, which can lead to greater engagement, creativity, and productivity when done right,” said Rhonda Overby, president and CEO of Baltimore-based marketing and PR agency Camera Ready, in an interview with CMO.com. “If all you’re ever doing is meeting, however, that potential is undermined as there’s no time to do. Success comes with the proper balance of discussion and action.” Endless meetings can cause marketing professionals to confuse activity with productivity. “If someone spends six hours in meetings, they’re killing more than half their workday right there,” said Dennis Collins, senior director of marketing for InterCall, in an interview with CMO.com. “Even when meetings seem completely necessary, just one extra meeting per day can negatively impact employee productivity.” A need to generate consensus, collaborate, or advance a project are all decent reasons to bring people together. Status reports or updates are not. One simple rule: If you can’t quickly pull together an agenda or a goal for a corporate confab, scratch it. What else should marketers keep in mind? Here are 12 do’s and don’ts shared with CMO.com for getting the most out of meetings. We bet you’ll be nodding your head as you make your way through this list. Do Send Out An Agenda “The No 1 reason for a poor meeting is the lack of an agenda,” said Mark Roberts, CMO at ShoreTel. “A good agenda will outline topics to be covered, goals, required attendees, materials needed, and a start and stop time.” Try to keep most agendas to 30 minutes, and distribute the meeting plan at least two hours prior. “Always give any assignments well in advance of a meeting so that people can be prepared with the right content,” said Marissa Tarleton, CMO of Retailmenot. Use the functionality of Web or videoconferencing tools to post the agenda as a visual reminder during the meeting. Don’t Schedule Status Meetings Consider using digital tools for project management, rather than calling a meeting for progress updates. “No one wants to sit around and rehash the work they’ve been doing,” said Joe Staples, CMO of Workfront. “They should be sharing creative ideas to resolve challenges, brainstorming, and collaborating.” Do Master The Basics Try to determine the most productive time of day for the get together, especially if you have attendees in multiple time zones, Staples advised. Arrive at meetings early, and encourage others to do so. Start on time—whether or not all parties are present. “Meetings can never run later than scheduled, but we hope to accomplish the meeting goal earlier than the time allotted for the meeting,” said George Athan, CEO of Mindstorm Strategic Consulting. “This prevents one meeting to affect others.” Never combine meeting purposes, either. “If you want to praise your team, don’t [tack it on to] a meeting about something else,” said Alexander Ruggie, PR director for 911 restoration. Also, treat every meeting as important, said Chris Trick, CMO of ERA Real Estate. “While the tone and formality of gatherings can vary, the value of the attendees’ time doesn’t, so make sure you bring the same energy each time,” Trick said. Do Guide The Discussion “When the conversation strays off topic or moves beyond the meeting agenda, bring the discussion back and table any relevant points raised for future discussion,” Shoretel’s Roberts said. “Being overly polite to people who hijack a meeting will only result in it being less productive.” Eliminate distractions, such as mobile devices and computers, and discourage side conversations. Don’t Streamline At The Expense Of Valuable Input “When it is clear that the priority is speed and efficiency, it’s inevitable that some voices will not be heard,” said Patrick Partridge, CMO of Western Governors University. “That’s why it’s important to create a safe and open environment where the sharing of ideas and opinions is allowed and encouraged. Meetings tend to favor those who are more vocal, but it’s important to not overlook these additional voices that can add to the meeting.” While maintaining meeting focus is critical, so, too, is soliciting input from more introverted or junior attendees. “Encourage open, honest, and straightforward dialogue, and be vocal about this at the start of a meeting to set the tone,” ERA Real Estate’s Trick said. Capture off-topic ideas (designate a note taker) while moving the conversation along. Do Have Fun “Once a meeting becomes boring, all productivity goes out the window,” said Eric Bosco, CEO of programmatic advertising firm Choicestream. Bosco has been known to arm a team lead with a nerf gun to shoot any speakers who run over their allotted time. (That meeting was very productive, Bosco said.) Once a month, Retailmenot’s Tarleton has her team nominate a star performer to spin a wheel for prizes (stand-up paddle boarding, house cleaning, restaurant gift cards) at the marketing meeting. “For weekly companywide meetings, we infuse humor with two-minute long, employee-produced videos,” Tarleton said. Don’t Always Spread Meetings Out Consider clustering them. “Scheduling back-to-back meetings forces you to start and end them on time,” said Talent Inc. CMO Diego Lomanto. “Furthermore, the half hour between meetings is rarely productive, other than answering emails, which should be batch-processed anyway. Consecutive meetings enable chunks of time for handing deep-dive work.” Do Take Breaks Ideally, meetings should last 30 minutes or less, but long meetings are sometimes necessary. In those cases, offer intermissions. “Though it may seem counterintuitive, interrupting the meeting for a break actually helps with productivity,” ERA Real Estate’s Trick said. “If done correctly, quick five- to 10-minute breaks help your team refocus and re-engage by giving them time to get up, walk around, check their phones or email, and then return to the meeting. Don’t Hold Hostages Not everyone needs to stay for the entire meeting, particularly on conference calls. “Most people don’t stop to consider this; they just issue a blanket invite for the entire meeting to all attendees,” Intercall’s Collins said. “By planning ahead and reviewing the agenda, managers can stagger invitations accordingly to ensure attendees’ time isn’t wasted. One of the biggest drops in productivity comes from distraction–that happens when people find the meeting irrelevant and yet they need to get other work accomplished.” Don’t Always Be Predictable Change the scenery. Change the time. “To awaken creativity, change the routine and get out of the office,” Talent’s Lomanto said. “A change of environment can yield a change in strategic thinking.” Consider booking meetings at unexpected times. “I often set meetings for only 15 minutes or schedule their start at the quarter hour,” Collins said. “This builds a buffer in case attendees are slammed in long-running back-to-back [meetings], and it also stands out more obviously in people’s calendars, so there are fewer no-shows or late arrivals that drain the momentum and productivity out of the meeting.” Do Close With A Plan Meetings should be vehicle for decision-making. “It’s common that at the conclusion of a meeting a fair amount of ambiguity may exist,” Western Governors University’s Partridge said. “It is important to reach a consensus or at least clarify the direction or decisions and to identify future actions required.” Retailmenot’s Tarleton ends every meeting with a list of actions items and who is responsible for them. “Not only does this make meetings more efficient, it streamlines workflow in general,” she said. Don’t Be Afraid To Decline Even the most thoughtful leader can find himself mindlessly accepting every meeting request that hits his inbox. “Just because you get an invite doesn’t mean you have to accept it blindly,” Collins said. “Check the agenda and attendees. If it doesn’t seem like you fit, ask the host why they want you and if it has to be for the entire duration. You’ll help them clarify their intent and might save a few minutes of your time in the process.” (Reuters) Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags business meeting personnel staff time management work Previous Violence flares in Washington during Trump inauguration Next ‘Police need more support to do their job’ Related Articles Greek bond yields leap after failed bailout talks January 27, 2017 German prosecutors open fraud inquiry into former VW CEO January 27, 2017 Microsoft profit up as demand for cloud service soars January 27, 2017 Starbucks curbs 2017 revenue forecast after U.S. store visits drop January 27, 2017 Weak exports seen crimping U.S Q4 economic growth January 27, 2017 Foreign workers in Japan hit 1 million for the first time January 27, 2017 Australia’s LNG projects face major delays January 26, 2017 Lebanon opens five gas blocks January 26, 2017 After stronger 2016, Greece hopes lenders will drop austerity demands January 26, 2017 Check Also Australia’s Qantas restarts direct flights to Beijing after 8 years Australia’s Qantas Airways relaunched daily non-stop flights from Sydney to Beijing on Thursday ahead of … Iraq to double oil export capacity at terminal Iraq has started work to double the crude oil loading capacity at one of its … Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Here Are 10 Signs It's Time to Call a Real Expert SEO is--and always will be--about more than just content, yet most business owners don't realize that. By John Rampton John Rampton is an entrepreneur, investor, online marketing guru, and startup enthusiast. He is the founder of online payment company Due. Best known as an entrepreneur and connector, Rampton was recently ranked No. 2 in Entrepreneur magazine's Top 50 Online Influencers in the World, and named a marketing expert by Time. He currently advises several companies in the San Francisco Bay area. @johnrampton Entrepreneur and investor@johnrampton WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Many business owners choose to go the DIY route when it comes to SEO. Because let's face it: it isn't cheap to hire an amazing SEO professional! I get it and have been in the same situation as you building up my business. Over the past year I've been growing a bit, so I've been taking on a bit of this myself. There may come a time however, when you need to admit to yourself that you're out of your element. If any of the signs below sound familiar, it may be time to wave the white flag and hire an SEO expert! 1. You think SEO is something you can do once and then forget about it I was talking to a business owner the other day, and he mentioned that he knows he needs to work on his SEO. Problem is, he assumed all that job would entail is taking a day to update the fields in his SEO plugin. While some SEO tasks can be updated in a day, achieving high rankings takes a long-term SEO strategy. Once you've optimized your site, it will take an average of 4-6 months to start seeing results. At that point, you'll likely need to tweak some of your strategies, or even change them all together. In other words, don't expect to take a day or weekend to "do" your SEO, and then expect it to work for your site. If this is your expectation, it's definitely time to consider hiring an expert. 2. You've been slapped with an SEO penalty, either now or in the past Manual actions are no joke. You have to know the rules and play by them. A penalty can seriously hurt your traffic, rankings and bottom line. Unfortunately, even the most ethical business owners can be slapped with a penalty - even though the owner didn't intentionally do anything against the rules. If you're currently working your way out of a penalty, you can always use my 12-Step Guide to a Google Penalty Removal. However, if you have a history of receiving manual actions, it's definitely time to invest in a pro. It's too easy to make mistakes, and they could be costing you big time. 3. You think SEO is just about content Because SEO and content marketing overlap in so many ways, many business owners assume all that's needed for high rankings is to continuously create new content. They believe that adding a new blog post every day or week will magically draw people (and search engines) to their business site. However, SEO is - and always will be - about more than just content. A successful SEO strategy will include three components: on-page optimization (which is where content comes in), off-page optimization and technical optimization. If you don't have the knowledge or skills to do all three, it's time to get a professional on board. 4. You don't have the time or interest to learn SEO Given enough time and training, almost anyone can learn to do SEO. However, keep in mind that there is a pretty big learning curve which will mean learning all aspects of the trade, including: Basic HTML and CSS. An understanding of good site usability. Knowing how to optimize your site for both mobile and desktop. Understanding how to build and earn links in 2016. Knowing how to use email and social media to increase traffic and rankings. While it's definitely possible to learn these skills and do your own SEO, many business owners prefer to spend their time actually doing what they're passionate about - running their business. If this is you, it may be time to outsource your SEO. 5. You don't or can't make SEO a priority According to Hubspot's 2016 State of Inbound report, 66% of marketers rate SEO as a top marketing priority for their company. This makes SEO a higher priority than both blog content creation and content distribution. If you want to remain competitive, you'll need to make SEO a priority as well. If you're like many business owners, you may not have the time to do the balancing act that SEO takes. If this sounds familiar, let yourself off the hook and hire an SEO expert who will do their job to get high rankings for you. 6. You're putting in the work but aren't seeing results You only have so much time, energy and money to invest in SEO. Given the multitude of other important tasks that demand your attention, your SEO efforts need to be productive. As mentioned, you should expect to start seeing movement in the search engines in about 4-6 months. However, you should also be evaluating whether those increased rankings are actually driving traffic and conversions; not all keywords will drive lucrative traffic, even if you've achieved the top spot in the SERPs. If you're working like crazy and just aren't seeing a positive ROI, it's definitely time to invest in a pro. While this won't come cheap, the end result will be worth it. 7. You don't have time to keep up with changes in the SEO world It's been estimated that Google makes changes to its algorithm around 500-600 times each year. While these won't all be big changes, some can have a significant impact on your website's rankings. Regularly consulting the Moz Google Algorithm Change History (above) will keep you up-to-date on the most important changes, as will subscribing to leading industry blogs like Search Engine Land and Search Engine Journal. However, if you don't have the time or interest in keeping up with these sites, hiring an SEO will give you confidence, knowing that being aware of these changes is part of their job. 8. You know just enough about SEO to be dangerous Most business owners have a pretty good grasp on the basics of SEO. They understand how on-page optimization works, and they know how to build links to their site. However, if your knowledge ends here, you could be setting yourself up for trouble. There are some SEO strategies that seem innocent enough, but could end up: a) making your SEO ineffective or b) getting you into trouble with Google. These include: Duplicate content issues: This can be a big issue particularly if you're re-posting or syndicating your content on other sites Buying links, or not disclosing sponsored links Linking out to unsavory sites Using too many keywords in your content ("keyword stuffing") Allowing low-quality guest posts on your site These are just a few of the issues that could get you into trouble. Fortunately, a dedicated SEO professional will know exactly what to avoid to keep your traffic and rankings flowing. 9. You're a local business, but have no experience in local optimization Understanding general SEO is one thing, understanding local SEO is another. While the basics are the same, there are certain strategies you'll want and need to understand and implement if you want to rank for local search queries. For instance, your first step will be to register for Google My Business. This will give you a free business listing in the SERPs, including a map, your hours of business and contact info. It will also allow you to collect and display ratings and reviews for your business. You'll also need to target keywords relevant to your local community. This will include city and neighborhood names, as well as industry-related words and phrases. For more info on the basics of local SEO, check out my post Optimizing Your Local SEO Using These 4 Basic Guidelines. 10. When your chosen keywords just aren't working for you There are tons of free keyword research tools out there that can help you find relevant keywords. Some of my favorites include the Google Keyword Planner, Keywordtool.io and HitTail. While these may be all you need to find high-value keywords, in competitive markets you will likely need the support that can only come from more robust, paid tools. There are many Tools that can take your keyword research to the next level, allowing you to find lucrative keywords your competitors are targeting. Unfortunately, some of the best tools come with a big price tag. Pro SEOs will already have access to these tools, meaning you get all the benefits of in-depth keyword research, without the learning curve or additional cost. Final thoughts If your SEO efforts are getting you the results you want, keep plugging away! Hiring an SEO isn't cheap, and if you're seeing a positive ROI, there's nothing wrong with going the DIY route. However, if you're putting in time, money and effort with little reward, now's the time to ask for help and invest in professional SEO work. You won't regret it. I s it time for you to hire a professional SEO? Why or why not? Share below! The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

Here are a few suggested excuses: – My horse butted me in the face. (I don’t ride, never have, wouldn’t know where to locate a steed or a stable.) – I’m a martial artist. This is not my first black eye. I walk around with a black eye most days. (Martial arts and equestrian pursuits are equally absent in my daily routine.) – A visitor was swinging her arms demonstrating her story for those sitting at my kitchen table, and as I came up behind her carrying a tray of warm butter tarts she drew back her elbow and unintentionally punched me in the eye. (A tasty scenario, but a sham nonetheless.) – I dropped my hairbrush under the sink. When I bent down to retrieve the hairbrush, I bumped into the corner of the sink. (Really?) – A toddler and I were playing on the floor. The two-year-old flung a wooden block that thumped the bridge of my nose. (A plausible likelihood 20 years ago, but not today.) I understand why any female with a black eye would be concerned with how to explain it. Chances are any viewer’s first conclusion would be that the woman is suffering physical abuse perpetrated by someone, whether a parent, boyfriend or spouse. But suppose the true reason for the black eye has no relation to abuse of any sort? How does the woman face the world in her daily activities, knowing the thoughts likely percolating in the minds of everyone she meets, even total strangers? It’s possible to delay the weekly shopping trip until the purple bruise fades to green so as to avoid calculating glances from store clerks and bank tellers, but by then the fridge could be running on empty. Only movie makeup generously applied with the gusto of a dry waller filling a seam can mask a shiner in its first 48 hours. Finding a plausible excuse for a shiner has occupied my thoughts for the last two days after I woke up one morning with a purple raccoon rim under one eye. As I reached for my toothbrush and saw my reflection in the bathroom mirror my first thought was, “Wow! Where did that come from?” It didn’t hurt. I hadn’t fallen out of bed or bumped into the night stand. Only one explanation was possible. Because I take prescription blood thinners, my skin easily bruises. The slightest pressure such as a dog’s claw raking down to my knee, or a pinch from a manual can opener will  bruise. The bruise gradually fans out like a jet plane’s contrail. I evaluated the bruise and concluded my eyeball was not involved. This was simply a bruise of the lower eyelid. No doubt what happened, the night before while watching late night news, eye drops had oozed out of the corner of the eye; the eyelid became uncomfortably itchy. Absentmindedly I had rubbed the eyelid, too vigorously. To track any changes that might occur I took a photograph, and another two hours later. Gradually the bruise adopted a colour that matches my Land’s End fleece top. Visitors were too polite to ask, “What happened?” though their curiosity was clear. Before I delivered the medical history leading to my pugilistic disfigurement, I tossed out the old comic’s line, “You should see the other guy!” Claudette Sandecki checks the mirror daily from her home in Thornhill, B.C.

Though one must admit, that at first glance, with his floor-length dreadlocks and numerous tattoos, some may be intimidated by his undoubtedly distinctive appearance. And unfortunately for most people, his highly visible tattoos become the sum of his person. But looks can indeed be deceiving. and the Malaysiakini columnist is one clear-cut example why we should never judge a book by its cover. For example, one of the tattoos on his arm reads “jangan bunuh bahasa ibunda” (don’t murder the mother tongue), in support of the anti-Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics in English (PPSMI) movement. However if you were to speak to him, you will find that he is quite articulate in the English language himself. When met at his home in Ampang, Rahmat apologised profusely for the “messy” conditions of his home. This, despite his living area being like any other living room, and some who may see him as being artfully “messy”. Rahmat even asked whether the interview would be a conflict of interest due to his position a columnist for Malaysiakini’s Malay section. Throughout the three-hour long interview, Rahmat often break into toothy smiles while speaking on various issues, as he sporadically puff on his rolled cigarette. Describing his tattoos, Rahmat is definitely not in the dark about how some people perceive him. “This is the first thing that they Google about me, they are not interested in my art (but) they are interested in my appearance. “They don’t talk about my ideas, my views published on Malaysiakini. They just say ‘he has tattoos’. “Which is strange - it shouldn’t be that you view people just by their appearance,” he said. Rahmat, who has more than 10 tattoos, admits it is considered “blasphemous” to have them, at least according to polite society. But the 39-year-old believes he is merely celebrating the Malaysian culture by having tattoos, citing Chinese traditions as well as that of East Malaysia. “It’s just that I don’t come from those cultures. But that’s how cultures are made - it’s something fluid,” he said. For the artist, having tattoos is not about morals and Malaysians should instead talk about the various problems plaguing the country. “Maybe according to your dogma and morals, it’s bad and it’s sinful to have tattoos. “But using your own logic and argument, it is also sinful also to be involved in corruption, to destroy the ecosystem.” For the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.

Google wants to fix this with its new Instant Tethering feature. The new feature is currently rolling out as an update to Google Play Services. When you have multiple devices logged into the same account and one loses a connection, it will automatically offer to share another device's internet connection. For now, the feature is very limited. Only Nexus and Pixel devices running Android 7.1.1 are supported. Furthermore, only phones like the Pixel and Pixel XL will be able to share their internet connection with tablets like the Nexus 9 and Pixel C, not the other way around. One Pixel phone can share its connection with another Pixel phone, however. It seems that Google is still testing to this to see how well it will work. However, if this works out it should make staying online much easier. Google is rolling out a new feature called 'Instant Tethering' in Play Services 10.2 [Android Police] Comments Jayd Guest Jan 22, 2017, 8:35pm One Pixel phone can share its connection with another Pixel phone Because everyone carries 2 pixel phones logged into the same google account.

WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. January 21st 2017 7 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Aussie consumers turned to other Android phones in the wake of the exploding Samsung Note 7 fiasco. Picture: Ahn Young-joon Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM SAMSUNG has officially revealed faulty batteries caused its flagship Galaxy Note 7 phones to catch fire and has announced steps to avoid repeat incidents in the future. The announcement came more than three months after Samsung scrapped the short-lived competitor of Apple’s iPhones, wiping $US5.3 billion off its operating profit in one of the biggest tech failures in history. Investigations by the company and independent organisations found the batteries were the sole cause of the Note 7 fires, Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin told reporters during a briefing in Seoul on Monday. The major headache for Samsung provided a big opportunity for its competitors to gain an edge in the increasingly competitive smartphone wars. Consumer confidence was always going to be rattled by Samsung’s exploding phones debacle, so which companies actually gained from Samsung’s loss? Surprisingly Samsung’s biggest rival, Apple, did not benefit from the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco in Australia as Aussie consumers sought other Android smartphone brands in the wake of the global recall. That’s according to figures released by consumer website Finder.com.au which measured “brand intent” among Aussie consumers comparing smartphones and mobile plans on the market. “We measured brand intent via our mobile phone plan engine, which is a page consumers visit to either switch phones and/or plans,” Finder.com.au’s technology commentator Angus Kidman told news.com.au. “Our data shows Aussies’ first handset preference, reflecting brand intent. This data does not indicate purchases or sign-ups.” This photo taken on September 13, 2016 shows a blown-up Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in Gwangju, 270km south of Seoul.Source:AFP The 2016 smartphone brand analysis was based on the comparisons of 56,000 Australian consumers who visited the website, he said. From August to September (when the first incidents of the Note 7 catching fire occurred), brand intent for Samsung dropped by almost a third. It moved from 32 per cent of mobile comparisons involving Samsung devices to 23 per cent. It steadily decreased over the rest of the year, finishing at a low of 19 per cent brand intent in the month of December, the company said. That interest shifted from Samsung phones to other Android devices with Google being one of the big winners with the release of its first smartphone. Google brand intent almost doubled among Australian consumers, growing by 86 per cent, according to the analysis. Interest in Huawei doubled, increasing by 101 per cent while Oppo saw an increase in searches by 53 per cent. Apple remained the first smartphone preference for Australians with brand intent sitting at an average of 62 per cent, followed by Samsung at a 25 per cent average in 2016 and all other manufacturers at 13 per cent. However Apple brand intent among Australians remained relatively steady over the year. This graph shows the proportion of handset searchers on Finder.com.au. A clear decline for Samsung is evident from August.Source:Supplied Most Android phones are cheaper than Apple’s iPhone, which is probably why Apple failed to gain a major boost from the Samsung fallout. Mr Kidman also believes Australian consumers are creatures of habit, preferring to stick with a familiar operating system. “For many, choosing a new phone is swayed by the operating system. We’re creatures of habit and like the comfort of knowing our way around our phones. A new OS means figuring out how to do the simplest of tasks like changing your ringtone,” he said. There was also many consumers who reported being underwhelmed by the latest Apple iPhone. “There weren’t many major design changes in the iPhone 7 compared to previous generations, and one of the most notable was also highly controversial: eliminating the headphone socket,” Mr Kidman said. “For someone switching from Android, that could feel like a deal-breaker, especially when there is such a wide range of Android devices to choose from.” -With AAP Jump back to top Right now in technology 182Readers 2016 WF9: Asteroid could trigger mega-tsunami 47Readers ‘This is library’: Trump protest shut down by unlikely sourc... 36Readers Queensland shipwrecks: Four 19th-century shipwrecks found 37Readers Australia Day: triple j Hottest 100 trolled on Facebook MORE IN Mobile Phones Netflix update will frustrate iPhone users Wi-fi to kill mobile black spots You need to update your iPhone Apple’s Siri to become a cricket tragic FOLLOW US ADVERTISE ABOUT US JOIN Please enter a valid email address Legal: Privacy Policy Relevant Ads Opt-Out Cookie Policy Terms & Conditions A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Mobile World FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Latest Pure Nexus ROM Update Brings Header Options and One-Handed Mode GO The custom ROM can be installed on Nexus and Pixel phones Jan 23, 2017 05:29 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  The Pure Nexus Project aims at bringing stability and new features to Google Nexus and Pixel tablets and smartphones. The idea is to keep “Google’s vision in line” and provide users with a stable ROM with minimal bugs and tested features. The team behind Pure Nexus announced a new update that brings header options and a one-handed mode to Android Nougat users. The latest update is aimed at Android 7.1.1 Nougat users on Nexus and Pixel phones, although some versions can be ported to other devices as well. According to a Reddit thread, the new update brings a feature that allows users to change the header background and adjust other elements as well. Users can change the number of rows in portrait and landscape mode, add a custom header image and enable the notification panel header image or pick a header provider. Shadow effect can also be added to the header image and there’s a feature for browsing installed headers. One-handed mode and a bunch of other features Moving on, one-handed mode allows users to navigate through their phone by using just one hand. This makes it easier to browse through various apps and even reply to text messages. One-handed mode is a feature found in multiple third-party launchers or even custom ROMs, just like Pure Nexus. The changelog for the new update also brings double tap to sleep feature on navbar and the ability to hide VPN and data saver icon in the statusbar icons. Moreover, users can expose the quick settings tuner switch bar for themers, settings switch bar for themers and settings dashboard category padding for themers. Multiple icons for apps have been updated to a circle design, one of the main characteristics of Android Nougat and an element that sets this OS version aside from previous Android mobile versions. Users should keep in mind, though, that flashing custom ROMs on phones could result in loss of warranty. #Pure Nexus#Pixel#Pixel XL#Nexus#Custom ROM subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Android 7.1.1 Nougat Running Surprisingly Well on 7-Year Old Galaxy S1 Google Says Fix for Known Audio Issue Is Coming Soon to Pixel Phones Android Wear 2.0 to Supposedly Arrive on February 9 Google App to Bring New Google Assistant Features New LG G6 Leaked Picture Shows Metal Frame, Thin Bezels Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB3216755 Apple in Trouble As More Buyers Get the iPhone 6s Instead of the iPhone 7 LeakedSource Website Goes Dark Shazam Adds Three App Shortcuts for Faster Song Recognition on Android Phones LG Files Patent Applications for Foldable Smartphones Alcatel to Announce Five New Smartphones During MWC 2017 Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast    Pure Nexus update with one-handed mode New Android APKs Brave Browser APK: Updated January 27th, 14:13 GMT Signal APK: Updated January 27th, 14:10 GMT PokeAlert - Notification for Pokemon GO APK: Updated January 27th, 14:08 GMT SmartThings Mobile APK: Updated January 27th, 14:07 GMT Newsroom APK: Updated January 27th, 14:03 GMT United Airlines APK: Updated January 27th, 14:01 GMT Reddit APK: Updated January 27th, 13:56 GMT Reader comments Motorola Files Patent for Iris Scanner, Could Be Featured on Moto Z 2017 more on: Motorola i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

A notice released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Sunday said that all special cable and VPN services on the mainland needed to obtain prior government approval – a move making most VPN service providers illegal. The “clean-up” of the nation’s internet connections would start immediately and run until March 31, 2018, the notice said. China’s cybersecurity chiefs pledge total loyalty to leadership under Xi “China’s internet connection service market ... has signs of ­disordered development that ­require urgent regulation and governance,” the ministry said. The crackdown on unregulated internet connections aimed to “strengthen cyberspace information security management”. Major VPN service companies including Vypr and Express said they were aware of the issue. While a representative from Vypr said the company was ­“currently working on ways around this”, a representative from ­Express by the name of Dane said that his company would ­release an official statement on its blog soon. China blocks access to 135 out of 1,000 sites in one ranking of the world’s top websites, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, according to Greatfire.org, which monitors online censorship on the mainland. As a result, many internet users on the mainland rely on VPN services to access blocked sites and services. A cat-and-mouse game has thus been going on for years between the authorities and VPN service providers. The last major crackdown on VPNs was in March 2016 during the National People’s Congress meeting in Beijing. Many companies complained that their paid-for VPN services were not functioning for up to a week. China cybersecurity law likely to harm foreign firms operating on mainland, says Asia finance body chief Beijing’s censorship of online information and its control of internet access would be particularly vigilant in 2017 for the once-in-a-decade power reshuffle party congress, analysts said. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet and acts as an online censorship office, pledged loyalty to the Communist Party leadership headed by President Xi Jinping on January 5. Bureau officials issued a statement that said one of their priorities this year would be to cultivate an online environment that was “conducive to a successful 19th party congress”. Two days ago, two websites run by a liberal think tank, along with 15 other sites, were shut down as control tightens ahead of the party congress. The latest crackdown has caused a stir on the internet, with many social media users complaining that their VPN services had failed or slowed down. Some expressed fears of losing touch with the outside world or of being held accountable by security ­forces for using a VPN system. One Weibo user wrote: “So many people are laughing at how [US President Donald] Trump is building a wall near Mexico while we are unaware that we have been thickening our own wall. The more we monitor, the more we lose.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Beijing shores up great firewall   Most Popular Viewed 1 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 2 Why the rich breathe easier in China’s choking smog 3 China’s central bank ‘playing dangerous game’ to prop up yuan 4 Andy Lau could be out for nine months after freak horse accident 5 On China, Trump tests ‘madman theory’ Shared 1 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 2 Why the rich breathe easier in China’s choking smog 3 Workers and residents evacuated after 220kg wartime bomb found 4 On China, Trump tests ‘madman theory’ 5 Lack of popular mandate would make it hard to govern, Lam admits Commented 1 On China, Trump tests ‘madman theory’ 2 Hong Kong must understand the limits of its autonomy 3 Will Beijing take a risk on a fair leadership race in Hong Kong? 4 Why Jakarta needs to read up on 15th-century England 5 Why China’s lawyers need the world’s support Promotions Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like Hong Kong CIA files reveal anxiety over Hong Kong’s future under Chinese rule 21 Jan 2017 - 11:18pm 43 Smart-home kits keep pet owners connected In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Opinion How Trump will try to smash Eurasian integration 22 Jan 2017 - 11:00am 4 Strategic Capital unveils ultra-luxury residential project Brought to you by JLL China How will Melania’s style compare with Michelle Obama and Peng Liyuan? 20 Jan 2017 - 9:21pm 30 Post Magazine How language dictates the menu at our Lunar New Year feasts 22 Jan 2017 - 7:32am Hong Kong Sheung Shui eco-village offers a taste of nature for city dwellers Jan 20th 2017, 7:40pm Hong Kong John Tsang makes his leadership pitch as healer of city’s ills 20 Jan 2017 - 10:30am 49 Hong Kong CY Leung uses final policy speech to refute lame duck criticism 19 Jan 2017 - 11:35am 20 Hong Kong Two dead at Macau casino complex 19 Jan 2017 - 11:54am China China ‘preparing to hit back’ against US if Trump starts trade war 19 Jan 2017 - 1:37am 26 Food & Drink Hong Kong food delivery services put to the test 20 Jan 2017 - 3:40pm 5 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

"We are taking responsibility," said the company's mobile President DJ Koh after a four-month-long investigation that came to a head today, during a press conference in Seoul, South Korea. The reason behind the Note 7 fires comes down to irregularly sized batteries, which caused the overheating, as well as other manufacturing problems in a second round of replacement batteries that were rushed out. Samsung sealed a sizable 3,500mAh lithium-ion battery into a 7.9mm thin smartphone, but half of the Note 7 batteries were made by its subsidiary Samsung SDI and didn’t properly fit into the Android phone. The subsequent overheating caused the first round of battery explosions and fires throughout August and September, and a handful of the incidents were caught on video or in photos. Short on time? Check out our video for the key points and whether we think Samsung has done enough to win back consumers. Samsung, nobody cares about your 8-point battery safety check Why the Note 7 battery went up in flames a second time Samsung recalled and reissued all Galaxy Note 7 phones in September, thinking that the other half of its phones – the ones with batteries made by affiliate Amperex Technology – were fine. The aftermath of an exploded Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (Photo credit: The Verge) However, the sudden ramp up in the second batch of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones seems to have caused a number of different manufacturing issues. At Samsung's press conference, the company said that there could have been a number of failures during this rushed process, with contributing factors including missing insulation tape and sharp edge protrusions. Image 1 of 2 Issue: The negative electrode was deflected in the upper-right corner of the battery. Image 2 of 2 Issue: High welding burrs on the positive electrode resulted in the penetration of the insulation tape and separator which then caused direct contact between the positive tab with the negative electrode. The one-two punch of production errors caused Samsung to issue another recall and ultimately cancel its popular, S-Pen toting smartphone, leaving billions of dollars on the table in the process. Samsung says that 96% of the 3 million Galaxy Note 7 phones sold have been returned worldwide, but US carrier Verizon said that ‘thousands’ of its customers are still holding onto the phone on its network. What’s next? Samsung Galaxy S8 More than money, Samsung’s reputation as the top Android phone maker has been damaged. The Note 7 is now banned on airplanes and, for several months, there was a PR-devastating flight announcement about the ban before every US plane took off.  All of this is will hurt the Samsung brand going forward, as it plans to launch new phones. The Samsung Galaxy S8 will be its new flagship handset for 2017, and it looks set to arrive in March/April this year. In short, it’s coming soon and part of Samsung’s press conference was to reassure the public that safety is (now) its top priority. It's taking "several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again," the company said today in a statement issued to TechRadar and the media. Going forward, it plans to implement multi-layer safety measures protocol at the product planning stage and an '8-Point Battery Safety Check.' But will today’s admission coupled with a (hopefully) superior Galaxy S8 be enough to keep people from switching to the iPhone 8, LG G6 or HTC 11? Only time will tell, and it will come down to whether people are happy to take Samsung's word that its batteries will indeed be safe in future devices. Samsung Galaxy S8: release date and everything you should know Don’t iPhones catch on fire too? This is the first line of defense from Samsung’s still-loyal (slightly smaller) base, and it’s what we would call mostly false for a few simple reasons. It’s true, there have been reports of iPhones exploding over the years, but they are spread out;  too few and far between. It’s not enough for a recall, but it’s enough to get everyone nervous. There’s an important lesson for all smartphone owners in almost all of these iPhone explosion horror stories: they often involve using faulty third-party chargers, meaning it’s never been determined to be an internal battery issue. Will there be a Samsung Galaxy Note 8? Samsung went on record soon after the Note 7 issues last year to say it plans to launch a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 in 2017 - which may surprise some readers. It's been much quieter about a potential Note 8 launch since October 2016 though, with no further confirmation of a next generation phablet during its Note 7 press conference. Looking at the wider picture though it makes sense. The Note 7 problems were isolated to just that handset - the Galaxy S7 is fine, as was its predecessor the Galaxy Note 5.  There's no question that Samsung's phablet line has taken a serious knock, but there's still demand for a premium big-screened smartphone and the South Korean firm makes some of the best around. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 release date, news and rumors Apple, Google and LG swoop in The biggest beneficiaries of the Galaxy Note 7 recall are Apple, Google and LG, and all of them have smartphones that compete with Samsung flagship devices. iPhone 7 Plus is Apple’s phone that comes closest comparing to the Note 7 due to its 5.5-inch display. You can actually walk away with some extra cash and a free iPhone if you have a Note 7. While Samsung has offered the Galaxy S7 Edge and $100 as a replacement for its recalled phone, it has also been willing to exchange the troubled phone for an iPhone 7 Plus and still pay [former] customers $25. Ouch. Google launched the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL running its latest Android 7.0 Nougat software and compatible with the Google Daydream View VR headset. The fact that Google is taking a bigger role in hardware (and not just Android software) is just as much a threat to Samsung as Apple has been.

The German automaker will put 40 of its 7 Series sedans on the road and train them to drive in urban areas, Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s head of development, said in an interview. The goal is to apply the gathered data toward producing the iNext, which will supplant the 7 Series as the BMW brand’s flagship model and be capable of full autonomy four years from now. Automakers and technology companies are rushing to form partnerships to compete against the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has clocked 2 million self-driving miles on public roads, and Tesla Motors Inc., with 1.3 billion miles of data from Autopilot-equipped vehicles. BMW is appealing to other carmakers to adopt its approach to help shoulder research costs, speed development by sharing data and ensure they don’t become also-rans. “Those who reach the finish line before you will have their tech become the basis of standardization,” Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chief technology officer, said in an interview. “This is why sharing is important.” BMW will be following Uber Technologies Inc. and Volvo Cars in putting autonomous cars on the road, with the latter two companies partnering on test vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Other carmakers have been reluctant so far to heed BMW’s call for adopting its platform. Rival Daimler AG has said it prefers to develop its own technology. Mobileye shares rose as much as 4.4 percent to the highest intraday in three months and traded at $42.12 as of 1:12 p.m. in New York. Costly Technology Enabling vehicles to navigate without human input through cities requires them to see and understand complex situations more like people do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye brings expertise in cameras that model the surroundings while Santa Clara, California-based Intel wields computing capabilities to power artificial intelligence. The companies released details Wednesday in conjunction with CES 2017, the consumer-technology show in Las Vegas. “If everybody would use the same network, it will be best,” Froehlich said. “At the beginning, I think only premium cars will be able to afford such technology.” Carmakers could participate by buying sensors to install in their cars, or go deeper with equipment that helps crowd-source data from an autonomous-vehicle fleet, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Automated Driving Division. While Munich-based BMW’s main target is individual car owners, the technology will be available for ride-sharing fleets as well, Froehlich said. Auto manufacturers are pushing into so-called mobility services like car-sharing and ride-hailing to counter alternatives to private vehicle ownership. Partnerships Form BMW, which co-owns the DriveNow car-sharing venture with Sixt SE, will be jockeying for consumers’ attention against the likes of Uber, Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, among others. Google, which separated its self-driving car project into a new unit called Waymo last month, plans to start a ride-sharing service using semi-autonomous minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as soon as the end of 2017. VW is rolling out Moia, a new division that will focus on ride-sharing. Revenue from car-sharing is projected to surge more than sevenfold to 4.7 billion euros ($4.9 billion) by 2021, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group Inc. Robo-taxis will make up 40 percent of automotive profits by 2030, more than selling vehicles to individuals, according to consulting company Roland Berger.

Women's March in St. Paul. Jan. 21, 2017. Emmily Bergstedt March leads to wacky press conference, which leads to phrase "alternative facts" Not just in the U.S., but across the globe, people gathered in hundreds of cities Saturday to protest the election of Donald Trump and his administration's policies as part of the Women's March.  Reports of around 5 million people protested in every state in the U.S. and beyond, including Antarctica and multiple cities in the Eastern Hemisphere. Estimates in Washington, D.C., were around 500,000.  In Madison, police estimated between 75,000-100,000 people protested, while numbers in St. Paul hovered between 90,000-100,000. Two overlying themes, aside from the obvious mass protest to Trump's inauguration, were that no arrests were made - in Washington, Madison or St. Paul - during the peaceful protests, which was not the case Saturday in D.C., and that estimated numbers in nearly every city swelled beyond expectations. It doesn't end there, however. The Women's March website has begun a plan of action for the next 100 days with the first step being writing Senators. The Madison rally numbers rivaled that of protests against Gov. Scott Walker's Act 10 anti-union legislation in 2011.  In Chicago, estimates came in around 250,000 and the march had to be cancelled because of the huge crowds. Protesters gathered in Grant Park and the surrounding areas. The estimates in New York range between 200,000-500,000, as some headed up Fifth Ave. toward Trump Tower. Los Angeles came in between 200,000-750,000, while another 250,000 rallied in Boston. UConn professor Jeremy Pressman has a running tally of crowd estimates in the U.S. in this Google doc, which brings U.S. totals between 3.3 million and 4.6 million protesters. Beyond the borders, in the UK, between 80,000-100,000 joined the Women's March on London, raising banners, flags and their voices against Trump. And, another 14 marches took place in towns and cities including Manchester, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leeds and Belfast the Guardian reported. Women March Around the World Hundreds of thousands of women gathered in Washington in a kind of counterinauguration after President Donald J. Trump took office. They were joined by hundreds of thousands around the nation and the world. Read more: http://nyti.ms/2iWZe4v Posted by The New York Times on Saturday, January 21, 2017 Even in Antarctica they protested. Around 30 eco-minded tourists and non-government scientists aboard a ship in international waters hoisted signs saying "Penguins for peace" and "Seals for science," organizers said. Yes, even people from Antarctica are joining the #WomensMarch movement https://t.co/hpoyM1daIO pic.twitter.com/HvYtHifz0m — CNN (@CNN) January 21, 2017 Saturday, instead of acknowledging the protests, Donald Trump, at CIA headquarters, said the "dishonest media" underestimated the numbers of his inauguration. “It looked honestly – it looked like a million and a half people," said Trump, who wouldn't have been able to see the grounds on a foggy afternoon. "Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on the thing, and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field. And it said we drew 250,000 people. Now that’s not bad, but it’s a lie." The 250,000 estimate could have come from, literally, the amount of tickets printed, according to Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies website, or it may have come from Dan Gross, who helped coordinate at Barack Obama's 2012 inauguration. #Inauguration crowd size?  The difference in pictures. pic.twitter.com/SulfzccOyc — Dan Gross (@DanJGross) January 20, 2017 Analyst Keith Still, a professor at Manchester Metropolitan University in England, estimated Trump's crowd on the National Mall on Friday to be about one-third the size of Obama’s 2009 inauguration, according to the New York Times. Whatever the number, pictures show a different story, though Trump said of the media reports, "So, we caught them. And we caught them in a beauty and I think they're going to pay a big price.” Trump made the National Parks Service pay a price for retweeting a comparison picture between Obama and Trump inauguration crowds on the National Mall - which the parks services manages. Trump's administration ordered the parks service to stop using its Twitter account and deleted the retweet. This was the retweet from a NYT correspondent that was deleted. Compare the crowds: 2009 inauguration at left, 2017 inauguration at right.#Inauguration pic.twitter.com/y7RhIR2nfC — Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) January 20, 2017 The parks service has since apologized to Trump for the "mistake" of retweeting two comparison pictures on the site of its own park.  We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you pic.twitter.com/mctNNvlrmv — NationalParkService (@NatlParkService) January 21, 2017 Since the inauguration, Trump's White House Press Sec. Sean Spicer and senior aide Kellyanne Conway have been on the offensive. Late Saturday, Spicer called the new White House's first-ever press conference to complain about inauguration coverage, saying the reports "to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong."  Spicer didn't take questions and gave excuses as to why the inauguration numbers were either low or were reported as such. His reasons, however, were immediately criticized as either completely false or vague/misleading, as both CNN, the Washington Post and others reported. Following up Spicer's presser, on Sunday Conway was on Meet the Press defending the press secretary, saying he was giving "alternative facts," which may be an early candidate for word/phrase of 2017 (2016's word of the year from Oxford Dictionaries was post-truth). Host Chuck Todd immediately questioned Conway's remark, saying "Alternative facts? Four of the five facts (Spicer) uttered, the one thing he got right ... Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true. Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods." "Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods," Chuck Todd tells Pres. Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway this morning. WATCH: pic.twitter.com/Ao005dQ13r — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) January 22, 2017 Trump didn't acknowledge the 2-million-plus people protesting his election Saturday around the globe, but he did take to Twitter on Sunday. Around 7 a.m. he wrote, "Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly." Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017 And hour and a half later - after a Tweet about how more people watched his inauguration than four years ago - Trump added, "Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views."

With offices, malls and other commercial establishments preferring to outsource cleaning jobs, the cleaning sector is going through a positive growth trajectory. “It’s a tough job to recruit labour and ensure that they do cleaning perfectly. Therefore, offices and commercial establishments prefer to outsource it to some other agency if possible, rather than doing it themselves. Outsourcing the cleaning job will not only relieve establishments of an unnecessary headache, but will also be very cost-effective. This trend is creating a market for the cleaning industry,” said Murthy A L N, business development manager at McLean. McLean counts Google, TCS, Novotel Hotels, ITC Hotels, Dr Reddy’s and others among its client list. The market for the cleaning sector comes from both offices and commercial spaces across sectors such as IT/IT-enabled services, hospitality, healthcare, industries and even from the government sector. Of late, even government offices have been outsourcing cleaning jobs. Given the growing preference by businesses for outsourcing of cleaning and house-keeping jobs, the sector has been growing at a fast clip and the industry size is pegged at Rs 2,000 crore per annum in India. “The advantage from cleaning industry is that it has huge scope to create jobs, especially for unskilled. Right now, about 10 million are employed in this sector and with the sector set to grow further, more jobs will be created. There is also huge scope for small entrepreneurs and start-ups in this sector, because a cleaning services business can be started with as less as five workers,” explains industry expert Managala Chandran. With the market expanding, even the sector is getting more organised. Besides employing people, it is also looking towards the use of more machines and tech upgradation. But unlike in the service segment, the Indian cleaning sector is yet to make strides in the manufacturing sector. “Over the past three to four years, the sector has registered more than 20 percent growth. In case of cleaning equipment manufacturing, 10-15 percent growth is being witnessed. We have to invest in research and development to come up with machines suited for Indian conditions and it needs investment. Not much thrust is seen in manufacturing of cleaning equipment as of now, though it might grow as the sector grows in size,” says Shashank Sinha, marketing head of Eureka Forbes. Eureka Forbes and Roots Multi Clean are among the few Indian companies that manufacture cleaning equipment indigenously, while most of the companies import machines from China and sell them here after re-branding. Though Nilfisk, Karcher and other international companies have a presence in the Indian cleaning equipments sector, industry insiders say that even these foreign companies are not focusing much on India, thus presenting a scope for indigenous manufacturing in the sector. Puneet Mishra, director of Comac India, points out that as the cleaning sector is expected to grow, in the future even the cleaning equipment and machines manufacturing segment might see growth. While a long-time strategy is needed for giving a fillip to equipment manufacturing, training unskilled workers is the immediate problem to be addressed by the industry, as there are no training institutes or organisations right now for skilling in the sector. “As there are no skill development programmes as of now, organisations are recruiting and training the employees themselves. Even we are planning to design and conduct skill development programmes, as the sector can create jobs,” said Vaishali Sinha, founder and general secretary of I-Professional Housekeepers Association.

Finance Search Cuba sees explosion in internet accessAAP – Mon, Jan 23, 2017 1:10 PM AEDT Two days before Christmas, Luis Gonzalez received a little Chinese modem from Cuba's state-owned telecommunications company. The 55-year-old theatre producer connected the device to his phone and his laptop computer, which instantly lit up with a service unimaginable in the Cuba of just a few years ago - relatively fast home internet. "It's really easy to sit and find whatever you need," Gonzalez said as he updated his Facebook account, listening to Uruguayan radio online. "Most Cubans aren't used to this convenience." Home internet came to Cuba in December in a limited pilot program that's part of the most dramatic change in daily life here since the declaration of detente with the United States on December 17, 2014. While Cuba remains one of the world's least internet-connected societies, ordinary citizens' access to the internet has exploded over the past two years. Since the summer of 2015, the Cuban government has opened 240 public Wi-Fi spots in parks and on street corners across the country. Cubans were previously restricted to decrepit state internet clubs and hotels that charged $US6-$US8 for an hour of slow internet. In a country with an average monthly salary of around $US25, the price of an hour online has dropped to $US1.50 - still steep but now well within the range of many Cubans with private income or financial help from relatives abroad. The government estimates that 100,000 Cubans connect to the internet daily. A new feature of urban life in Cuba is the sight of people sitting at all hours on street corners or park benches, their faces illuminated by the screen of smartphones connected by applications such as Facebook Messenger to relatives in Miami, Ecuador or other outposts of the Cuban diaspora. Connections are made mostly through access cards sold by the state monopoly and often resold on street corners for higher prices. The spread of connectivity has remotely reunited families separated for years, even decades. It's fuelled the spread of Airbnb and other booking services that have funnelled millions in business to private bed-and-breakfasts owners. And it's exposed Cubans to a faster flow of news and cultural developments from the outside world - supplementing the availability of media spread on memory drivers. Cuban ingenuity has spread internet far beyond those public places: thousands of people grab the public signals through commercially available repeaters, imported illegally into Cuba and often sold for about $US100 - double the original price. Mounted on rooftops, the repeaters grab the public signals and create a form of home internet increasingly available in private rentals for tourists and cafes and restaurants for both Cubans and visitors. On the official front, Google and Cuba's state-run telecoms monopoly Etecsa struck a deal in December to store Google content like YouTube video on servers inside Cuba, giving people on the island faster, smoother access. While the explosion of internet in Cuba has occurred alongside the process of normalisation started by Obama in 2014, it's unclear how much better relations have speeded up Cuba's move online. In announcing detente, Obama said he welcomed "Cuba's decision to provide more access to the internet for its citizens," but neither Obama's team nor Cuban officials have detailed whether that decision was directly linked to negotiations to restore diplomatic ties and began negotiations. What is clear is that Cuba began to dramatically increase access about six months later when the government began opening Wi-Fi spots around the country. For many Cubans, the start of home internet in December is potentially even more significant, breaking a longstanding barrier against private internet access in a country whose communist government remains deeply wary about information technology undermining its near-total control of media, political life and most of the economy. The pace of change in Cuba often depends on the state of relations with its giant neighbour to the north: both tensions with the US and leaps forward like Obama's visit to Havana in 2016 have prompted crackdowns by hardliners worried about the government losing control. While US President Donald Trump has promised to take a harder line on Cuba, both opponents of President Raul Castro's government and those advocating closer relations favour more access to information for ordinary Cubans. The home internet test program selected some 2,000 residents of Old Havana to receive free connections for two months before a planned expansion and the start of billing for the service. Gonzalez said he would be able to receive 30 hours of his 128 kilobyte-per-second connection for $US15, with the price increasing for faster connections, with 30 hours of a 2 megabyte-per-second connection available for $US115. That's far slower and wildly more expensive than internet in most of the rest of the world. Cuba depended on slow, expensive satellite internet until 2013, when it opened a fibre-optic cable to Venezuela that connected the island to the global online infrastructure. Cuba says that its still-high internet prices are a result of costs imposed by the US trade embargo on the island. Independent observers blame the costs on political decisions to limit access, and on the cash-strapped socialist government's widespread use of its monopoly power to extract as much money as possible for goods and services considered luxuries. Many young people hope that the spread of access in recent years is the start of Cuba seeing internet more as a necessity and a right, like the free education and health care guaranteed by Cuba's socialist system.

The upcoming wearable has been rumored for a long time and it first surfaced online back in October. Like with the previous leak from last year, the photos of the HTC Halfbreak show a very similar smartwatch. The device comes with a circular display with two physical buttons on the right side and a rubber watch strap. HTC's smartwatch shown running older version of Android Wear. Photo: Weibo Related Stories HTC Is Cutting Back On Smartphone Releases In 2017 HTC U Play Is U Ultra's Mid-Range Brother On the back, HTC’s logo is accompanied by Urban Armour’s logo. The photo of the back also gives everyone a clear look at the heart rate sensor, as well as a set of four metallic pins which are presumably for charging the device. The HTC Halfbreak shown in the photos also appears to be running an older version of Android Wear and Google Play services from 2015, as pointed out by Android Authority. Android Wear 2.0 is rumored to launch next month on Feb. 9, which is why it’s a bit odd that this device isn’t running a pre-release version of that software. HTC and Under Armour's logos on the back of the new Halfbreak smartwatch. Photo: Weibo The HTC smartwatch has been rumored ever since Google first announced Android Wear back in 2014. HTC never released an Android Wear smartwatch in 2015 and 2016, and it was also reported that the device may have already been shelved, according to Android Headlines. It’s being speculated that the HTC Halfbreak smartwatch might be officially unveiled during this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain which kicks of on Feb. 27. With Android Wear 2.0 already being out for a couple of weeks by then, the timing makes a lot of sense. Looking at the big picture however, HTC’s plan to release a smartwatch this year could be a bad idea. Smartwatch sales have struggled in the past year, and the company faces heavy competition with the likes of Apple, Samsung, LG and Fitbit.

By editor • Jan 22, 2017 Related Program:  All Things Considered TweetShareGoogle+Email Listen Listening... / Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Earlier in the program, we talked about the media and it's often fraught relationship with the Trump administration set off most recently by a confrontation about the size of the inaugural crowds. Now, Donald Trump has been accusing the media of distributing what he calls fake news for some time. In those instances, President Trump seems often to be referring to information that is accurate, but that he finds upsetting. But The New York Times just published a piece about something that journalists, as well as others, find even more worrisome - the spreading of completely false information under the guise of news. New York Times reporter Scott Shane managed to track down a practitioner of this and convinced the man, Cameron Harris, to describe how and why he did it for a recent piece titled "From Headline To Photograph: A Fake News Masterpiece." SCOTT SHANE: Cameron Harris is a 23-year-old recent graduate of Davidson College in North Carolina. He majored in politics and economics, and by his account - he's Republican, very active in politics, wants to be a political consultant. But he claims quite credibly that he did this really more for the money than for the politics. MARTIN: Cameron Harris created several false stories for a defunct news domain christiantimesnewspaper.com which he'd picked up for $5. Many of the false stories were debunked almost immediately by the respected fact-checking website snopes.com. But one story of Harris' has stood out to Scott Shane. It read "Breaking: Tens Of Thousands Of Fraudulent Clinton Votes Found In Ohio Warehouse." I asked Scott Shane why Cameron Harris decided to write this particular story and why it had such a big impact. SHANE: There was a point when Trump began to say that he feared the election would be rigged, and then he started repeatedly saying in every speech he gave, you know, they're rigging the election, the election's rigged. And so there was this feeling that on the part of his supporters that somehow something was going wrong and that Hillary Clinton was doing something, you know, illicit to rig the election. And so Cameron Harris decided he would try to tap into that by essentially providing the proof that this election was rigged. So he said he started with a headline, you know, "Tens Of Thousands Of Fraudulent Clinton Ballots Found In Ohio Warehouse" - made up out of whole cloth. And he invented a guy, an electrician, who had wandered into a backroom at a warehouse and stumbled upon these boxes of ballots that were pre-marked for Clinton. He decided a picture would be good. And he went - and he did what any one of us does when we want to find a picture of something. He did a Google image search, and he found a picture in the Birmingham News in the U.K. And it was from an election, but an election, of course, completely unrelated to the presidential election in the U.S. But it showed a gentleman standing behind a big stack of ballot boxes, so he just took that picture from the Birmingham News and said that that was a picture of this man who discovered the fraudulent Clinton ballots in Ohio. MARTIN: You say that even though Cameron Harris who made all this up is a Republican and is inclined to support Republicans, that his real motivation was money. He just wanted to make the money from the clicks. So do you have any sense of how much money he made from this fake story? SHANE: I do. He actually shared with me his statement from Google that essentially gave the revenue for the life of the site, and it totaled $22,000, which is not a huge amount of money. But Cameron Harris estimated that he put a total of 20 hours into this project. So for the time that he put into it, it was, you know, more than a thousand dollars an hour. That particular story - his greatest hit so to speak, the one about the fake Clinton ballots - that one he estimated made about $5,000 by itself. He said it took him about 15 minutes to write the story. MARTIN: When you confronted him, how did he feel about what he had done? Did he express any remorse? SHANE: You know, to defend himself, he started kind of doing what, in fact, Donald Trump has done recently which is accuse the mainstream media of fake news. There's a difference between, you know, taking unverified information and trying to prove it or disprove it. And that's very different, in my mind, from sitting down to make something up out of whole cloth that you know from the beginning is false. He didn't fully seem to accept or grasp that distinction. MARTIN: So was there any reaction to your story? SHANE: Yes. Actually the Maryland delegate, the member of Maryland legislature that Cameron Harris worked for as a sort of legislative aide read the story and fired him immediately, saying he, you know, would not tolerate dishonesty. And the other thing that happened is that Cameron Harris' alma mater Davidson College in North Carolina, which prides itself on its honor code, actually put out a statement expressing, you know, essentially regret that one of its alums had gotten involved in something like this. And then the president of the college sent a letter to all alumni, again, sort of expressing regret about this and saying they would use this fake news case study involving one of their graduates as a lesson for future students to teach them about, you know, the honor code and the difference between right and wrong. MARTIN: That was reporter Scott Shane from The New York Times. Thanks so much for joining us. SHANE: Very glad to be with you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

If there is one thing we will always be able to count on, it is that the internet will continue to be the internet. The internet will continue to be the weird, awkward, hilarious, and bizarre place where just when you think you’ve seen everything – someone posts about something that shocks, amazes, and maybe even disgusts you. Still don’t believe me? Well, Bustle created a list of hilarious 2017 Inauguration Day tweets and memes that will help you laugh through the pain. And this list? Well, it is just one of many lists with all the hilarious social media posts and pictures floating around the internet about Inauguration Day. Donald Trump [Image by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images]] Whether you are or are not supportive of Donald Trump being president of the United States, I think we can all agree the mood is filled with a lot of hate, anger, and sadness right now. There really isn’t as much happiness and laughter as there should be. Fortunately, funny 2017 Inauguration Day tweets can help change that. After all, if it wasn’t for the internet and social media, phrases like “Bernie Sander’s steel chair” wouldn’t be trending on Google right now, but I’ll get to that a little later. For now, sit back and enjoy some 2017 Inauguration Day tweets intended to lighten the mood. Just consider putting down the beverage for this one. No one wants to shoot their beverage from their nose while laughing. Inauguration Day Weather Report The https://t.co/240qFK2wmo forecast for inauguration day in DC is warm showers.

I can't decide if this crowd seems too small for a presidential inauguration or too big for a 3 Doors Down concert. — Vincent Casimir (@vncnt_csmr) January 20, 2017 People were joking about the size of the Inauguration Day crowd long before the media and Trump’s association started arguing about it.

Even then, there were a lot of people on social media hoping Bernie would appear and knock Trump out with his steel chair.

Some were questioning why he didn’t just wear a waterproof jacket. Some even thought it looked a little like he was just trapped in the plastic and trying to get out of it. What do you think?

Personally, the tweets of George W. Bush trying to get into his poncho are my favorite from this list. However, I’d love to know your favorite.

Moon Express, a Florida—based firm, said it had raised $20m in financing, which will allow it to send a robotic spacecraft to the moon’s surface later this year. The funding is a major step in its efforts to become world’s first private enterprise to travel outside the Earth’s orbit. Last year, Moon Express gained historic approvals from the US government after submitting a request for its voyage to the Federal Aviation Administration. An outer space treaty, which was adopted by the UN and regulates exploration of the celestial world, requires governments to authorize and supervise “non—governmental entities” seeking to travel in outer space. Moon Express is one of 16 teams that have competed for funding as part of Google’s Lunar X Prize initiative, which launched in 2007 to incentivize private firms to develop technology and plans for planetary exploration. Moon Express, which said it has raised a total of more than $45m from individuals and venture funds, is one of numerous companies that has specific plans in the works for exploration. A firm called Deep Space Industries is seeking to launch an autonomous spacecraft this year that can extract materials from asteroids. Planetary Resources, a company supported by Google’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, is also building technology dedicated to asteroid mining with the goal of 2020 commercial mission. Last year, the US government advanced the process to establish rules for space launches in compliance with international treaties after Luxembourg and the United Arab Emirates pushed forward with similar efforts. Motley Fool, a financial services site, has estimated that the mineral wealth of the moon may be quadrillions of dollars.Guardian News & Media Ltd, 2017 The US, China, India and Japan and former Soviet Union are the only countries that have landed spacecraft on the moon.

Jaideep Mehta 2017 will see the gradual influx of 3D printers into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. Photo: iStock Imagine this: you are travelling for work to London and staying in an apartment rented through Airbnb. As you hail the Uber cab for your business meeting, your phone beeps an urgent message and you swipe your finger on the fingerprint scanner to read the notification. You learn that a critical machine on your shop floor is overheating, and the message tells you that based upon previous experience, it is likely to break down soon. As a precautionary measure, the system has automatically sent a request to the in-house 3D printer to produce the component likely to be impacted. You pull out your Oculus from the briefcase, connect it to the app on the phone and get a visual of the machine and the impacted component. At the click of a button, the system also gives you three scenarios of the impact on the production if the machine goes down. You make the necessary phone calls using the low-cost WhatsApp and speak to the factory manager. Comforted by his response, your mind is clear for your upcoming meeting. What you have just done is leveraging mobile, next-generation security, Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, natural interfaces and analytics technologies to perform a simple but critical management intervention which ensured the smooth running of your business. Welcome to your new world, Ms CEO. A tsunami of new technologies has hit the business ecosystem. The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. That’s how profound the disruption is. Click here for enlarge On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott. The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities. The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, it’s still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industry’s growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and there’s enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon— and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them. Next gen security If you’re like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten “capital letter-alphanumeric—change-them-every-two-weeks” passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting ‘bad actors’ anymore: it’s moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apple’s fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systems The notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, they’ve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting ‘smarter’ on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though? A common example is the “May I help you?” assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBM’s Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but it’s not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT) The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet. The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that you’ve up. 3D printing At a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nike’s Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfaces What I wouldn’t give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! That’s Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and it’s here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, we’ve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii). Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual. On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, we’re seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware that’s available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem. In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age. Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia. Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021 Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms. Intelligent agents: Intelligent agents and related robots will have eliminated a net 6% of jobs by 2021. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR): By 2021, AR will be commonplace, while VR will remain niche. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technology: Solutions powered by AI/cognitive technology will displace jobs with the biggest impact felt in transportation, logistics, customer service, and consumer services. Hybrid wireless: 5G will be rolling out by 2021, creating a high-bandwidth cellular backbone to support IoT devices. In addition, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will expand their capabilities to support IoT devices.

Phuket Business Business Buzz: Social media trends to look out for this year Phuket Gazette - January 23, 2017 | 07:00 AM            As people's social media attention spans get shorter, the critical advantage for businesses will be building real relationships with their clients and partners. Photo: Amanda Paul PHUKET: As we begin another new year, it is a timely opportunity to consider what we should look out for in 2017. It is always important to reevaluate your digital footprint on a regular basis. Here are my 2017 tips to have a successful year in social media and beat your competition, increase your revenues and improve customer loyalty. Remember, an efficient sales funnel is critical, especially combined with a good product and a customer-friendly approach. Use these techniques to build your database, and consider splitting that between a local and tourist market if relevant. Stand Out From the Crowd Dare to be different. A lot of social media is people being sheep, following what others do without any real thought or application. Avoid this trap  find your voice, but don’t be afraid to do something different or untried. At the end of the day, the goal is to be seen and remembered. This will put money in the bank account  but just be careful about being too risque. Relationships Will Be Key There is no doubt that as people’s social media attention spans get shorter and shorter with more voluminous online marketing coming their way, the critical factor will be building real relationships. There is a fine line between selling and marketing  people love to buy but hate to be sold to, so build the relationship better than the rest and your sale will happen. Use Systems and Automation There are so many fantastic digital products out there at the moment that you would be crazy not to be using them. Often they are free or very cheap, and the benefits are golden. Why do the hard work when an app can do it all for you. Facebook Live, Instagram Videos and pictures will be used more in 2017. Imagine showing off your hotel rooms or new housing display live on Facebook with a limited time offer of availability, a dining experience at your restaurant, a live band at your bar the list goes on. This will create engagement, interaction and a following. Google Places Google and its takeover of everything internet means that if you are not plugged in you are missing out. Google Maps is now on almost every smart phone, and for zero cost your business could be showcased to your local clients. Make sure you get listed today. Create A Connected Digital Footprint Make sure that you have a cohesive, integrated online footprint. Decide what presence you want, then have them interconnect and work with each other. In my next column I am going to suggest what I would do if I had to start from scratch knowing what I know, but for the time being, think website, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.

According to Advertising Age, research firm Advertiser Perceptions polled 399 executives from some of the top-spending marketers and agencies, and uncovered widespread scepticism about the social media network's claims. Half of these advertisers said they would not spend money on platforms they consider to be risky, while two-thirds reported that they are now questioning their investment with Facebook. It seems that Facebook's acknowledgement of repeated errors and miscalculations at the end of last year has dented confidence in social media advertising as a whole, which now stands at below 50%, according to the survey findings. And that decreasing confidence is translating into marketers' decisions about budget allocations in 2017, with just 8% of respondents saying they plan to spend more on Facebook than Google compared with 36% who intend to spend more on Google rather than Facebook. "Facebook can't go whistling in the dark now," said Kevin Mannion, Chief Strategy Officer at Advertiser Perceptions. "While they've built up too much goodwill and success for the metrics restatements to automatically erode spending, they need to take the lead in third-party verification," he continued. "Digital advertising platforms can’t assume that trust issues will blow over. No matter what is being said in meetings or from conference stages, the biggest ad buyers are clearly apprehensive." However, while the survey pointed to concerns about Facebook and greater confidence in Google-dominated search advertising, the industry is unlikely to see a major transfer of budgets away from digital advertising, according to Rob Silver, SVP of Media at digital agency SapientRazorfish. "We are not seeing any of our clients pull away from digital platforms and shifting to TV or more traditional channels," he said. "The audiences and targeting enabled through digital are simply too important."

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 22, 2017 7:25pm   Comments Share: This weekend's Barron's cover story is the second part of the 2017 Barron's Roundtable coverage. Other featured articles offer a peek at the outlook for a tech giant and for a videogame retailer. The prospects for a dental supplies provider and a streaming media giant are also examined. "User's Manual for a Mixed-Up Market" by Lauren R. Rublin is this week's cover story and part two of coverage of the 2017 Barron's Roundtable. The panel of nine experts shares why they see value in housing, health care, auto parts and infrastructure plays, where to find 6 percent yields and why the outlook for India and Japan is sunny. Their picks include Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAB). In "Digital Ad Growth, YouTube Will Lift Alphabet 20%," Jack Hough suggests that Google is playing catchup in cloud services, helped by artificial intelligence and machine learning. And see what Barron's believes are two key milestones for advertising to watch for this year, and why Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) should be a major beneficiary of that. Can shares reach $1,000? Jack Willoughby's "Why GameStop Can Win Its Toughest War Game" takes a look at why, facing weak videogame sales, GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) has diversified by selling AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) phones and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) products. And the stock is very cheap for a company with strong cash flows to support its diversification plan and some growth catalysts. Investors collect a 6 percent dividend yield, too. Shares of veterinary and dental supplier Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ: PDCO) took a hit last year, and now they look undervalued, according to "Patterson Stock Could Return 20%" by David Englander. The end of a 20-year exclusive distribution relationship looks like an opportunity for investors, says Barron's, and increased profits and a higher stock price are bound to follow. In Emily Bary's follow-up story, "Don't Bet Against Netflix," Barron's admits that it underestimated the company's ability to build a worldwide customer base. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) has returned 300 percent since Barron's wrote about it in 2013. Risks remain for shareholders, says the article, but it is also risky to bet against Netflix — as long as it continues to beat subscriber expectations.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: TRANSPORTATION Yes, you can actually tweet from the 2017 Nissan Titan John Brandon@jmbrandonbb January 22, 2017 3:10 PM Tags: connected car, Facebook, Nissan Titan, top-stories, transportation, Twitter Above: A new “Texas TITAN” package joins the Nissan TITAN lineup for the first time for the 2017 model year. The package is available in a range of two TITAN and four TITAN XD Crew Cab grades, including 4x4 and 4x2 drive configurations. The 2017 Texas TITAN includes: chrome inner and outer grille finish, 20-inch chrome aluminum-alloy wheels, metallic-finish kick plates, Texas TITAN floor mats, chrome exhaust finishers, and Texas TITAN badging. Image Credit: Nissan Trucks have not always been the go-to platform for tech. In most cases, the size of the truck bed, the traction you get from the tires, and the engine torque were the most important tech considerations. Yet times have changed. People who drives trucks today are often business owners who need to stay connected or people who drive them on a commute. Recently, I tested the 2017 Nissan Titan, a full-size pickup with a starting base price of $29,580. It has a V8 engine, can pull around 9,000 pounds of cargo, and has a 390-horsepower engine that provides some zip for merging into traffic. Nissan started offering a “connected car” services with the Nissan Altima a few years ago, but the Titan is the first truck I’ve ever used that allows you to do Google online searches by voice and let people know where you are using Facebook check-in (which is admittedly a forgotten feature and rarely used — it dates back to when people used Foursquare). What impressed me the most is the ability to check a live Twitter feed and tweet directly from the cab of the truck. To tweet, you need to use the NissanConnect app. I loaded it onto my phone, and it worked smoothly in terms of logging in and finding features. I was in a press vehicle, so I selected the one I was using and then connected my phone by plugging a USB cable into a port next to the steering wheel. I also had to authenticate the Twitter app. Once it was all synced, I pressed an Apps button on the dashboard and then clicked the Twitter icon. You can scan through a live feed of tweets or compose a new tweet. If you decide to tweet, you can use a keyboard on the dash or select a stock tweet. For example, I used the “I love my Nissan” automated tweet. I’m guessing my Twitter followers wondered about that one. Then I typed in a few custom tweets like “Driving up north to see family” and “Heading to a meeting,” although I am not sure I’d ever actually use those. I mostly use Twitter to ask questions these days, to let people know about articles, and to make bad jokes. If anything, I’d type a custom message related to my day, which is probably a little more effort than any tweet needs. That said, I liked how it worked. On a long trip, I could see adding more custom tweets and keeping my feed active. The only problem with that? You can only tweet when the vehicle is stopped. In my tests, I tweeted several times while I was driving around an urban area. However, the live feed was active at all times. My problem there is that I tend to search for people and check their feed more than anything. Yet even if this is all still in an early stage, compared to how the rest of tech has moved into AI, chatbots, and many other areas of innovation, I’m still a fan. I see a car as a moving computer on wheels, something that will eventually drive itself and let us live tweet, check Facebook, and even hold a meeting over Skype. The Nissan Titan gets us a step closer to that vision. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Mensah, Registrar of a Circuit Court in Ho said at the weekend that students cannot continue to demonstrate ill-will towards technological knowledge acquisition in the 21st Century and succeed. Ms Lariba Nabila interacting with some of the participants He observed that the grandeur of the social media had taken the better part of students learning time at the expense of using the medium to research, deepen knowledge and become highly versatile and marketable in an era of limited avenues for employment. Speaking to the Ghana News Agency in an interview, Mr Mensah said if the time students spent on social media could be translated into serious academic work, it would deepen innovation, knowledge branding, entrepreneurship and scholarship. He recounted periods past, where parents could make reading and especially newspaper, part of the regimented growing up training models at home, which had been shelved to what he described as “Modernisation.” “You find students seriously glued to their Android phones, tablets and computers, deep in the night, using facebook instagram, Twitter LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google, Tumbr etc and dutifully chatting time away.” Mr Mensah said: “We are again in an era of frenzy for entertainment through music and movies,” and these seemed to be consuming the man hours students needed to justify their academic inclusion but being wasted. He thought that the information, communication and technology (ICT) highway should have opened greater opportunities ahead of the teeming youth to innovate and add value to trending academic issues than the social media craze. Mr Mensah said the overarching effect of social media sites was that students spent too much time socialising on the internet and lesser time in person. He said one positive attribution to fun-filled social media enabled students to multi-task and network saying beyond this, “Academic work is more paramount”. The Registrar urged duty bearers and the academia to set agenda for students and the youth in general to guard and guide their usage of the medium and challenge their mental forthrightness towards a more constructive consumption of ICT products for self-actualisation, nation building and development. Mr Mensah appealed to parents, who were the first point of contact for students to step-up their monitoring and supervisory roles at home and challenged them to use social media constructively to be informed and well-educated. According to data from the National Communication Authority, the number of mobile data subscribers rose to 18 million from 17.7 million in December 2015.

Researchers including two of Indian-origin reveal that, online behaviour can be identified by linking anonymous web browsing histories with your Facebook, Twitter and Instagram profiles. Browsing Habits may Reveal Who You are Advertisement Researchers from the Princeton and Stanford universities found that anyone with access to browsing histories can identify many users by analysing public information from social media accounts. ‘Online advertising companies build browsing histories of users with tracking programmes embedded on web pages.’ Advertisement "It is already known that some companies, such as Google and Facebook, track users online and know their identities," stressed Arvind Narayanan, Assistant Professor at Princeton University. Researchers said that those companies, which consumers choose to create accounts with, disclosed their tracking. "Users may assume they are anonymous when they are browsing a news or a health website, but our work adds to the list of ways in which tracking companies may be able to learn their identities," added Narayanan. The Federal Communications Commission recently adopted privacy rules for internet service providers that allow them to store and use consumer information only when it is "not reasonably linkable" to individual users. "Our results suggest that pseudonymous browsing histories fail this test," the researchers wrote. It was found that online advertising companies build browsing histories of users with tracking programmes embedded on web pages. "Each person's browsing history is unique and contains tell-tale signs of their identity," wrote Sharad Goel, Assistant Professor at Stanford University. The study is scheduled for presentation at the World Wide Web Conference 2017 at Perth, Australia in April.

Google have just released their latest round of improvements to the new version and it’s time to bid farewell to what they’ve renamed “classic”, although it’s hard to think of something as Classic that’s only been around since 2011. Events One of the changes many will welcome is that Events are coming to the new Google+. As the host of a Google+ event, you can instantly invite contacts (or make the event public), put the event on your Google calendar and keep track of RSVPs. Events automatically sync with your guests’ Google calendars and everyone attending can share their photos to a shared photo album. Google say that there is still more more to be done to improve the experience but from the 24th of January you’ll be able to create and join events on Google+ web as you have in the past. If you have a following on Google+, it makes sense to share you events on the social media platform, just as you would on Facebook and your website. Whether it be training or a webinar, a sale or a real life event, share it as widely as possible.

Many owners and managers put significant focus on keeping their scores high on sites such as TripAdvisor and Yelp. Rating Steamboat Local businesses adapt to world in which everyone is a reviewer By Joel Reichenberger Saturday, January 21, 2017 Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn Discuss 4 comments Advertisement It used to be easier, Rex Brice said, thinking back to his early days in restaurants. A reviewer — maybe from a nearby newspaper or maybe from a far-off magazine — would come in for dinner, and the staff would strive to be at its best, delivering no-holds-barred flawless service and the best versions of the menu options possible. “When it was one person there writing a story about your restaurant, you paid attention to that person,” Brice said. Print reviews don’t carry the same weight they once did. Instead, Brice and his six Steamboat Springs restaurants are now reviewed daily, their service constantly up for judgment and their food always being rated. Photo by Joel Reichenberger Strawberry Park Hot Springs is either a wonderful, unique local gem, or a waste of a trip down a long, icy dirt road, depending on which reviews you read. Those reviews pop up on Facebook and Google and, even more so on websites like TripAdvisor and Yelp, and they can make or break a new business. “Now, every customer is a food critic, someone who is potentially going to write something positive or negative about your operation.” Brice said. It’s a far different world than Brice came up in, but it’s one he and other restaurateurs and business people in Steamboat Springs don’t ignore. How could they when a few words and a handful of low ratings from dissatisfied customers can mean big problems. Every opinion matters Reviewing reviews is a daily task for many, and Scott Marr, who owns and operates the Holiday Inn in Steamboat Springs, reads every review that comes in about his hotel. They come from TripAdvisor and, to a lesser extent in the hotel industry, Yelp, but also the many travel booking sites, such as hotels.com, Priceline and booking.com, which have become the way so many book hotel rooms. “Every day,” he said. Behind a review Online reviews are a big deal for those being reviewed. They’re often a big deal for those doing the reviewing, as well. Some reviewers around the world have racked up more than 1,000 reviews on different sites — a major time commitment. What drives such a passion to spread the word? It’s a desire to give back, said one Routt County man, who’s filed nearly 100 reviews on Yelp and many more on other sites. “A lot of the time, restaurant reviews are colored by who’s paying the bill,” said the man who, on Yelp, goes by the handle ‘Joe.b’. “I’m not going to five-star everything. Unless there are honest voices out there, it’s not a very useful tool.” Joe said he’s been in Routt County for two decades and that he rarely eats out. When he does, his desire to review comes and goes. He does like to be the first to weigh in online about a new restaurant, however, and he loves to update his reviews, or offer new ones, as a restaurant grows and changes through the years. He uses services such as Yelp and TripAdvisor regularly, himself. Learning how to read reviews takes time, he said. Many only review their best experiences and their worst, and even those reviews might only mean so much. Joe suggests not only focusing on a restaurant’s star rating, but also giving a quick look at why a place may have gotten bad ratings. A one-star complaint about the lack of gluten-free options isn’t going to dissuade Joe from eating at a place. He’s just as likely to dismiss a five-star rave review filled with just-too-perfect praise from a rarely used account potentially bought and paid for or belonging to an employee. “Reviews are only as good as the reviewers,” he said, relating a quote from a friend. It’s the reviews that fall in the middle that he is more likely to trust, and those are the ones that encourage him to offer his own opinions. “I want to support the people in places I’ve gone to who have written good reviews for me to read,” he said. “It’s very much a karmic thing for me. I really do like good food and like to spread the word about good places.” He initially started by writing long, detailed reviews of restaurants but has since learned to tighten his copy and focus solely on his own experience. “I want it to be reflective,” he said. “I’m just going to say what experience I had and not blow it out.” The reviews are a part of every managers meeting, too. “Usually, they’re good, but we don’t really pay that much attention to the good ones,” he said. “Maybe one out of 20 is something we pull out of the stack and really take a look at, and it could be a complaint about anything, from a bad experience at (the attached restaurant) Rex’s to the toilet not flushing properly to someone at the front desk not treating them how they felt they should be treated.” An online complaint about a lumpy mattress can lead to a thorough testing of that mattress and, if need be, a replacement. Notes about checking in can lead to a review of procedure. Persistent comments about the lack of light in the hotel’s kitchenette suites led to the installation of more lights in every room. It’s about customer service, Marr said. Happy guests, and unhappy guests who feel they’ve been listened to, are good for many reasons, and one reason is their online reviews. Holiday Inn ranks on TripAdvisor as the No. 4 hotel in Steamboat Springs, with 405 reviews offering an average of 4.5 out of 5 stars. What would happen if the property suddenly lost a star, slipping to 3.5? “It would be significant, for sure,” Marr said. Those online ratings have changed how he does business. He spent about 10 percent of gross revenues on advertising a decade ago, reaching out to travel agents around the country and placing ads in national travel magazines. Now, the only money he spends that way is the 2.5 percent that goes to the national Holiday Inn brand as a part of the franchise agreement. “People don’t look at national advertising any more and make a decision on where to go,” he said. “They decide where they want to go, get online and do the research.” When they’re looking for a hotel in Steamboat, it’s imperative to his business that Holiday Inn is near the top. “It’s huge,” he said. Taking good with bad Pleasing customers can be important, but some people are hard to please. It only takes a quick look at reviews for some of Steamboat’s well-known attractions to realize that much. Fish Creek Falls is a reliable go-to for all kinds of tourists, and it ranks at the top of TripAdvisor’s “Things to do in Steamboat” list. Few would argue with that rank, but there certainly are a few who do. “Those fish don’t have to fall very far,” one reviewer wrote in 2016, offering three stars. “The view, while pretty, is not very special.” Others agreed. “Do not expect a splendid waterfall. As the name indicates, this fall is part of a ‘creek,’ warned a Paris-based reviewer with a healthy 121 reviews submitted. “There are two overlook areas but, truthfully, there is not much to look at.” Just a grump? Not necessarily. The Cottonwood Grill restaurant and Emerald Moon Massage, both now closed, earned five-star reviews from the same writer. Strawberry Park Hot Springs earned four. Don’t worry. The hot springs had plenty of dissatisfied visitors, as well. “The only thing more slimy than the rocks are the people there,” one Texan wrote last summer. “Imagine a bath with 50 toothless strangers …” The Yampa River Core Trail, featured on TripAdvisor with a beautiful fall photo, absorbs similar abuse. “If you were drawn to this by the photo someone added of the trees hanging over and shading the trail, then enjoy the photo,” a Front Range reviewer wrote. All three attractions rank highly on the “things to do list.” The core trail draws 4.5 stars and is No. 6 on the list of 63 activity suggestions. The hot springs weighs in at No. 4, also with 4.5 stars and 853 five-star reviews. Dealing with a few angry reviews is part of the game. It’s easy to laugh at Fish Creek Falls hate. It’s more difficult for local business owners to laugh when they find a review ridiculous or false. “We had a comment at Rex’s from a guest who gave us a very poor review, 1 star,” Brice said. “All their comments were very negative, about us gouging customers and raising prices on the hamburger. None of it was true. This was coming out of the recession, and I made a very purposeful choice to not raise the price on the hamburger. But, there's nothing you can do about that review, even though it's pure fantasy.” Judged from the start Online reviews, of course, aren’t the only thing that matters to restaurants. Word of mouth is a factor, too, and both can be huge for a new establishment. That hung on the mind of Brice when he opened his newest restaurant, Salt & Lime. “People judge you more in your first month of being open than they will for years to come,” he said. “It’s more important that you nail it then than ever.” The only problem is that it’s the most difficult time to “nail it.” “It’s really tough, because you’re new, and when you’re new, you aren’t perfect at anything,” Brice said. “The service isn’t perfect. The food isn’t perfect. Nothing is what it will be a year into it.” Early issues don’t have to ruin a restaurant, however. Kerry Shea owns and manages McKnight’s Irish Pub & Loft in Steamboat Springs. He took the management role over about a year after the restaurant and bar opened, and Shea said there was plenty of room for improvement, both in the restaurant and in its online reviews. “Our first couple of reviews weren’t great,” he said. Tweaks to the food, the venue and the business structure helped change that. Now, McKnight’s has 4.5 stars on TripAdvisor, though it’s ranked 24th out of Steamboat’s 118 restaurants reviewed on the site. “It’s the ultimate system of checks and balances,” Shea said. “It’s a very important business tool, and if you can take even the negative reviews to heart, they could assist you in a very positive way.” Sarah Piano, who runs Snow Buddy Dog Sled Tours in south Routt County with her husband, Dan Piano, didn’t realize how important TripAdvisor reviews would be when they started their operation in 2012. “Now, we get at least 80 percent of our business from it,” she said. The business rises and falls in TripAdvisor’s rankings based on the season. Now, fully in winter, it’s the No. 3-ranked “outdoor activity” on the site in Steamboat. The Pianos don’t ask people to fill out reviews, though if anyone asks what can be done to help their small business, it’s the top suggestion. Sarah Piano takes her dogs to Alaska to guide dog sled trips in the summer as a part of a much larger operation, often catering to tourists coming off cruise ships. That, she said, doesn’t always do so well in reviews, because there are so many different people involved and so many chances for a bad interaction. Back in Routt County in the winters it’s a drastically smaller operation — a passion project with few employees. That’s come across in reviews. “The right people are finding us,” she said. “We are getting the calls we need to get.” For local business owners, it all amounts to a far cry from life 20 years ago, when word of mouth still mattered, but when someone with a particularly good or bad experience didn’t have a megaphone. Now, they do, and that can cause some stress, worrying about rankings and reviews. It can also offer previously unheard of insight into an operation. Brice said he used to employ secret shoppers to get insight into how employees performed when the boss wasn’t looking over their shoulders — to get fresh opinions on the food and some thoughts on the drink menu. Those days are gone. Now, every person who walks in the door can offer that same advice if they so choose, and they can tell the world, even before they leave the building. The key, he said, is absorbing it. “Ninety-nine percent of the time you can take something productive out of it,” he said.

Very few people consider a simple negative or positive comment to have much meaning. Whether something is rated #4 or #14 is usually more indicative of how many fake ratings are submitted by employees and friends than actual quality. i note that one restaurant has a 5 star review by a SB resident and then a later review has a negative review complaining about a bad server with the same name. But something mentioned consistently has a greater likelihood of being true such as poor lighting in the kitchenettes. Personally, I expect the those with the highest ratings to just be best at manipulating their ratings, but I am reluctant to go to those with low ratings.

We find it to be quite revealing to hold the cursor over a reviewer's user name/avatar to see a chart of a given reviewer's ratings. Have these people ever heard of a bell curve or bothered to view rating breakdowns from other rating services such as Michelin, AAA, etc? Or is it their egos coming into play that they refuse to admit they made poor choices? Face it, most reviewers have zero professional training when it comes to providing a subjective rating about a restaurant and its food. Fair game are service, cleanliness, parking, staff presentation and ambiance. But preparation of a given entree?? The training simply isn't there. So when giving back by writing reviews of our restaurant experiences, it is more about the total package and experience. We often include photos of the facility and the food but you will never see a selfie in any of our reviews since it isn't about us. But a restaurant has to be very unique and primo in every aspect to earn a rating of 5 from us. To be sure a rating of 4 or 4+ indicates that a restaurant is well above average in our book. Hotels ratings are far different since there are tangible aspects such as cleanliness, noise, room size, parking, shower quality, temperature controls, condition of furnishings and the very subjective evaluation of sleep comfort. But again, to expect a rating of 5, an establishment has to be very darned special! For whatever reason, we seem to have the false expectation that all that we do is the very best and that we cannot be happy unless we follow rating systems designed to make decisions for us. What is wrong with making our own decisions and admitting it when we make bad ones? Isn't it about the total package and how they contribute to our knowledge and experiences?

Do you care if a place is highest ranked or just seek to avoid those that have many poor reviews? And it doesn't matter that some easily give out 5s and others give out few 5s. It averages out soon enough. Upvote 0 Post reply Please Login and/or Verify your account to reply Sign in to suggest removal Neil Camp 5 days, 1 hour ago Scott. I guess I use my own set of analytics for TripAdvisor that I have developed through the years? Actual ratings may get me to start to take a look at an establishment but rarely play into our final decisions. We do quiite a bit of traveing in Central and Southern Mexico (no coastal resorts). For restaurants, I do read the reviews written by those who I feel are credible and honest in their comments. I look at customer supplied photos, copies of menus, location and often do a driveby using Google Street View to get an idea on things like the neighborhood, the potential for excessive noise or traffic smells, outside seating opportunities and accessibility on foot since we really enjoy walking to/from dinner in the evenings from our hotels. When we visit Steamboat, we pay attention to the opportunities presented by the Transit Buses since I will NOT drive after even one beer or cocktail. I just checked today's listing of the top 30 ranked restaurants in Steamboat. While we have tried probably 60% on the list, I can say that a number fit our "comfort zone" and a number of others qualify for a no return. The ones in our comfort zone have received repeat visits and will likely remain on our positive list after we retire to Steamboat later this year. Hotels are a totally different animal for us. Large comfortable rooms and an outside area for relaxing are high on our list. Fancy amenities mean very little because we tend to be constantly on the go from the moment we finish our morning coffee till we return for an early evening break before heading out for dinner. We have a friend who happens to be a professional photographer who makes a living shooting glowing photos of hotel properties and he has explained the tricks of the trade. So once again, customer supplied photos are weighed more heavily. I do look through reviews for comments on the comfort factor of beds and the noise factors. We happen to be really big on location and how it may compliment our enjoyment of our non-driving hours. In Steamboat, we pay attention to the accessibility of the Transit Buses for our evening activities. When I see ratings of 5's accross the board for restaurants or hotels, I tend to discount them entirely! Don't know what the numbers are today but I can remember when Michelin only rated 20 restaurants in the world as 5 Star. I have also read a number of stories where restaurant owners or chefs have asked Michelin to lower their rating one star because customers where showing up with too high of expectations! In the US, we seem to have an obsession with ranking something the very best and why?

((Pixabay)) Share Written by Ephrat Livni Obsession Life as Laboratory January 22, 2017 In general, I think it’s wise to be self-critical. But I also believe that—in the deepest sense—we must trust our instincts and have the courage to put our ideas out into the world. Whenever I need a reminder about how to do this, I turn to Ralph Waldo Emerson’s 1841 essay on self reliance. “Self-Reliance,” considered Emerson’s most influential piece, works its magic much like an inspiring song that can get you through the last stretch of a grueling run. His central point is that we should not ignore those inner whispers, which may be barely audible under the din of outside influences and self-doubt. They may contain sparks of genius. After all, the world’s greatest thinkers and leaders had the courage to hear themselves and to follow their convictions, without concerning themselves overly about tradition and what others might think. They taught themselves to ignore the din and doubt, and their ideas resonated with the world because they reflected a truth that others had sensed privately as well. “In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts,” Emerson writes. “They come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.” In every book or painting or film that moves us, we respond because they speak to a truth we recognize—if only subconsciously. Easy for Emerson to say, we might think. He’s a genius himself. But remember, at the time he wrote his essay, he wasn’t yet considered a master of American literature. He was just a guy. His ideas hadn’t stood the test of time. Yet he understood the importance of holding convictions about your personal potential. “To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all … That is genius,” he writes. “Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost.” Still, it can be hard to feel sure of ourselves—particularly as our personal failures accumulate. And yet we must be brave enough to follow through on our ideas. Emerson’s essay helped push me to pursue my boldest creative goal. In 2014, I wanted to write a book of literary science fiction, called Too Long Don’t Read (TLDR). My idea was to pen a satirical work about text and context in a universal culture run by a tech company. It would be a cross between George Orwell’s 1984 and Don DeLillo’s White Noise—but shorter, futuristic, and based on my work on Google’s legal document review team. Basically, it was an insanely audacious goal. But hell, I needed to trust myself. Yes, Google is an adored tech company. Sure, I’m no Orwell. But I felt the book needed to be written. Emerson helped me do it. I printed out the essay and annotated it, carried it around with me, stained it with wine, and wore it out. Then I printed another copy and went back to underlining. I bookmarked the digital version of the essay on my computers at work and at home. I read and reread it. As I did, I became ever more certain that however ridiculous and daunting my goal might seem, the first step to accomplishing it was believing that it was worthwhile. Emboldened by Emerson, I dared to “abide by [my] spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility.” The themes of the novella—the blurring line between fact and fiction, how to process fake information on a web without context, and whether technology should be driving decisions—are now the stuff of daily headlines. But that wasn’t as clear when I started writing it, or when I blogged the story as a serial after countless publishers rejected it. I wrote the book—despite my many doubts, and those of others—because I was heeding Emerson’s warning that I’d be scooped if I held off. As he writes, “Else, tomorrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.” Each person has reason to believe in their own ideas, he explains, because each of us is unique. We each occupy a singular point in space and time, and our experiences can’t quite be replicated by anyone else. Emerson thought that “great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this.” They show why we must trust ourselves and “learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across [the] mind from within, more than the luster of the firmament of bards and sages.” Many others have also celebrated Emerson as offering high-minded self-help for literary types. Writing for The New Yorker in 2015, Dan Chiasson explains, “Emerson’s essays are like wonder handbooks … you can use [them] to become enchanted; many dejected secular people have gone to them regularly to see the world in renewed and refreshed terms of beauty. They outfit you for a walk in the woods or an ordinary morning.” But Emerson’s essays don’t just help you exist in the world. They urge you to make things, listen to the whispers, for the sake of creativity itself. “Self-Reliance” tells us that the process of creating is its own reward. We can only feel relieved and happy in life, he says, when we pour our hearts into our work and do our best. Anything less will gives us no peace. And so the essay frees us to speak our minds—and see what connects. Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.

By: Samden Sherpa Updated: Saturday, November 26, 2016, 15:10 [IST] The online notoriety is only increasing as cyber criminals are only getting better at what they do and while the world moves to more internet of things, cyber attack may become a great burden for many. More Importantly, it can be a threat to your privacy as well as your valuable information. While the internet can be both bad and good, there hasn't been an easy solution to completely delete yourself from the internet until now. SEE ALSO: Beware of These Reliance Jio, Narendra Modi, and Paytm Related Hoax WhatsApp Messages Significantly, Swedish developers Wille Dahlbo and Linus Unnebäck have created a Deseat.me, website which is now offering a chance to users way to wipe your entire existence off the internet in just few clicks. As such, the Deseat.me site uses Google's security protocol to wipe the accounts clean. The program runs on the user's computer, and not on the website's servers to further maximize privacy at all times. So you need to log in into the website with a Google account. It then scans for apps and services you've created an account for and creates a list of them with easy delete links. Every user account that the website finds gets paired with an easy delete link pointing to the unsubscribe page for that service. SEE ALSO: How to Get Unlimited RComm Voice Calling for Just Rs. 149 So, by just making few clicks you're useless accounts will be deleted, and depending on how long is your entire list, you can be account-less within an hour or so. Erasing yourself completely is not always possible, but if you follow these steps, you can certainly come close. However, the downside of this website is that it sometimes doesn't pick up everything you've created an account for. For some of the smaller web services, the delete button is greyed out and fail to appear sometimes. But the big web services like Facebook are there. Hopefully, the site will improve in the days to come it'll offer more options for self-deletion.

But when he entered the world of corporates, he had to give up that passion of his. Shortly afterwards, he heard about some of the photography groups in the city and decided to be a part of them. He took the aid of social media to learn more and enlisted the aid of the internet to experiment with photography. He soon bought a DSLR and now makes sure that he heads out every weekend for photo walks with his friends. He chats with Anila Kurian about his new journey in the world of photography. Describe your first experience with a camera. When I decided to become a part of the photography clubs in the city, I purchased a regular Nikon camera. I didn’t know any of the techniques and took help of the internet. Even with a lot of experimentation, I wasn’t too successful. The camera also had its limitations; I just used it for about six months and purchased my first professional camera. And how has that made a difference in your work now? I started spending time with a few photographers in the city and learnt a lot from them. I also used Google and YouTube to learn photoshop techniques. I started travelling every weekend to interior villages and this became a serious hobby! What type of pictures do you capture? I don’t believe in restricting myself to a particular genre. I take portraits, landscape and lifestyle related kind of photographs. I have done a bit of wildlife photography as well. I want to keep learning new things and experimenting whenever possible. Your favourite locations for taking pictures?  I go to different places with a small group of friends every weekend. We travel to places like Shivajinagar, K R Market, Kolar area or to other places just a few kilometres from the city. A recent favourite place you visited was... I went to a village near Yelahanka during Ganesh Chaturthi. They were sculpting the idols and painting them there. I found the process very interesting and I clicked it on my camera. The picture was widely shared and appreciated online; it was a proud moment for me. Photography to you means... More than just a picture. It is about connecting one’s emotion and becoming a voice. I’ve met people who don’t have the luxury to live like many of us but listening to their story and connecting that to the picture makes it worthwhile. Any dream locations you want to go to for pictures? No, I don’t think you need to go anywhere to take a picture. I can sit in my own house and find stories to tell with my pictures. The place doesn’t really matter. An advice to aspiring photographers. Keep clicking pictures and never stop experimenting. No one can teach you to become a good photographer but never stop learning.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Vinay Katiyar's controversial statement on Priyanka Gandhi...

BUSINESS Technology Spectacles might get the buzz, but for investors Snapchat is all about the advertising Snapchat Spectacles Al Seib / Los Angeles Times Los Angeles resident Albert Borrero tries his pair of Spectacles shortly after they went on sale in November. Los Angeles resident Albert Borrero tries his pair of Spectacles shortly after they went on sale in November. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Paresh DaveContact Reporter The company behind Snapchat has two offerings — that beloved, 5-year-old app for messaging and video streaming, and Spectacles, a months-old, $130 pair of sunglasses that double as a camcorder. The Los Angeles company has promised more gadgets will follow. But even with a significant increase, hardware sales in the near term probably would bring in 100 times less revenue than selling ads displayed on Snapchat. It’s that potentially massive, multibillion-dollar ad business that has investors most excited about Snap Inc., which is expected to open its stock to public trading in the coming weeks in one of the tech industry’s highest-anticipated initial public offerings in years. So why is Snap insisting it’s actually a camera company? The label introduced last year raised questions about Snap’s hardware ambitions. But more than signaling that Snap is the next Apple Inc. — a firm that makes software and hardware but derives about two-thirds of its revenue from iPhone sales — the distinction could be an attempt to help investors see the nuance between the goals of Snapchat and those of its most potent rival, Facebook. Unlike Facebook, Snap’s not out to connect everyone on the planet. Rather, its goal is to tinker with both the physical make of cameras and the code behind them, giving people new ways to chat with friends, have fun together and educate themselves about the world. Both companies rely on advertising revenue, but Snap, which declined to comment, appears to be suggesting its approach will be more focused. “They need to show they are not just Facebook for teens,” said Gene Munster, who studied Apple’s finances for years and now co-manages investment firm Loup Ventures. Tech companies that enjoy the most sustained success have visions beyond what’s visible to most today, and Snap is arranging itself to join that group. “Twenty years from now, the way we engage with the world will probably not be a phone," Munster said. “Hardware changes are going to be happening, and this mission gives them a foothold and foundation to be prepared for this transition.” Though the camera, both in apps and in gadgets, will be central to that aim, investors and the financial analysts who advise them ascribe minimal value to Spectacles and other hardware. They insist Snap’s real value is in the advertising business. If Snap wishes otherwise, it will have a long way to go before changing perceptions. “I would be hard-pressed to imagine them as a hardware company unless it's possible to see a long-term commitment to that business,” said Brian Wieser, who follows companies such as Facebook for Pivotal Research. “So for now, it’s an ad tech company.” Still, Snap joins financial technology company Square Inc. as one of the first Internet companies with revenue coming from both hardware and software at the time of an initial public stock offering. That split helps diversify its business, but it means Snap also will have to justify to investors any hardware-related expenses. Snap has shared limited financial data with potential investors and met only with a select group of analysts. More could become clear when it publicly shares its stock prospectus, which could be as early as this week. Experimentation doesn’t necessarily hurt share prices, said Scott Kessler, a financial analyst at CFRA. Amazon.com, Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet Inc. have gotten away with unrealized product goals as their core businesses continue to surge. “People want to see these companies innovating and trying new things,” Kessler said. But troubles can arise. For one, hardware can reduce earnings. “Software is the way to go because that’s a more profitable business,” Kessler said. “Manufacturing things, that’s obviously more challenging from supply chain, cost perspective. It’s a lot different than someone going somewhere and downloading software.” Still, companies often try to show investors before they go public that they are more than one-trick businesses. Ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc. has ventured into self-driving delivery trucks. Short-term rental booking giant Airbnb is trying to help consumers with more aspects of travel planning. Both could go public this year or next. But companies new to public markets must live up to those promises or risk seeing their value fall.  The faltering shares of GoPro, which closed a much-heralded video-distribution business two years after an IPO, and Twitter, which couldn’t maintain user growth, reflects what happens when reality doesn’t meet expectations. For Square’s part, hardware has grown slightly as a portion of its revenue mix. If anything, fear that many tech start-ups such as Snap are overvalued has led to more skepticism about second acts in the last year. Chinese phone maker and social media app developer Meitu has seen its shares barely budge from their initial price since going public a month ago. About 95% of Meitu’s revenue comes from phone sales, and analysts question how fast the software business can grow. Snap has used a vending machine to distribute its $130 video-camera sunglasses.

(Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) In Snap’s favor is that its second revenue line already has inklings of success. Spectacles have received positive reviews. Investors point to the long lines that Snap generated by selling the sunglasses through roving vending machines. It’s a wacky experience that has energized the industry. And because of Snap’s generally small release of thousands of pairs, investors simply are discounting the idea for now. “It seems like a noble experiment akin to Google Glass, but not yet a central part of the Snap value proposition,” said Chris Rust, a founder at Clear Ventures who held a board observer role at GoPro. Instead, Snap’s biggest challenge could be convincing investors to notice the distinctions with Facebook and showing them that profit is within sight. Alexander Stimpson, co-chief investment officer at Newport Beach money manager Corient Capital Partners, said he’s worried that companies going public before demonstrating recurring profitability have turned investors into speculators. It forces them to invest based on instincts rather than formulas. And despite the great risks, they stand to gain a much smaller return than the venture capitalists who held shares prior to the IPO. “If a company is unprofitable, the rewards should be substantial because you’re taking substantial risk,” he said. Because Snap isn’t yet profitable, Stimpson doesn’t mind coming late to the party when it may be a safer bet. “When there’s no earnings there, it forces investors to behave in a way that’s against their best interests to be successful long term,” he said. “Investors are successful when they are disciplined about valuations, when profits matter, when metrics matter, when they buy low and sell high.” Still, many analysts expect the excitement to be so great that Snap gets whatever price it wants. Hitting the stock market could bring Snap’s value upward of $25 billion. “Any time you have a brand-name company, you’re going to have a lot of interest,” said Ivan Feinseth, director of research at Tigress Financial Partners. “They are very strong in the teen, preteen and the millennial market. They’re a key player.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss So-called sanctuary cities were once places of refuge. A surge in media mergers is expected under Trump’s pro-business agenda. Chinese New Year begins tomorrow. Grocery store tomatoes are often tasteless but researchers at the University of Florida have discovered a game-changer.

Women's March movement: What's next and can the momentum last? Heidi M Przybyla, USA TODAY Sunday, 22-Jan-17 17:26:39 PST Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest WASHINGTON — Now that the Women’s March on Washington is over, women like 32-year-old Jacqueline Glass will determine whether it marked a historic one-day demonstration or the start of a widespread resistance to Donald Trump's presidency. Glass was among the more than 2 million people who came out in a show of global protest — from Washington to Sydney, Australia. Now women’s groups and civil rights organizations, such as Planned Parenthood and EMILY's List, are scrambling to harness that energy by enlisting more supporters and encouraging women to run for local public office. Glass, an African American who recently settled in Norfolk, Va., after retiring from the military, has felt off ever since the election, when her 10-year-old son woke up crying. “I don’t want him feeling like he’s in a place where he’s up against the world. This is America,” she said. “I was having these sinking feelings about the world and really down for a period of time,” she said. The feeling became so strong Glass took to Google, which led her to VoteRunLead, a New York nonprofit that grooms women for public office. She's now researching local commissions and boards in which to get active. “I’m taking these tiny steps toward an ultimate goal,” she said, which is to run for U.S. Senate. Read more: There's early anecdotal evidence that  some women are turning grief over the Election Day loss by Hillary Clinton into action. According to VoteRunLead, more than 2,300 women have signed up for training seminars in the past two months, a major increase. Planned Parenthood, which provides free health screening to poor women and is targeted by Republican leaders for funding cuts, is seeing hundreds of thousands of people signing up to volunteer and reach out to their members of Congress. EMILY's List, which works to elect pro-abortion-rights women, drew at least 500 women for a Sunday workshop in downtown Washington on running for office. “This is the moment of the beginning of the revival of the women’s movement,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., told the throng of demonstrators around the Capitol Saturday. “We don’t have equal pay for equal work in this country” or national paid family leave. “Until every woman and girl in this country has a chance to reach her God-given potential America will not reach its full potential,” said Gillibrand, something that won’t happen until they're better represented in government. Women are more than half of the U.S. population, yet they hold fewer than one in four seats in the nation’s state legislatures, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Running for office is just of many ways the event’s organizers are hoping women will take action. Filmmaker Michael Moore gave the crowd a “to-do list,” including running for office and calling Congress on a daily basis to resist the Republican agenda. He urged marchers to turn their communities into “regions of resistance” to fight Republican policies and pass progressive laws on health care and anti-discrimination measures. Recently, in Speaker Paul Ryan’s hometown of Janesville, Wis., 50 medical students in lab coats delivered a letter signed by 400 health care professionals to his office. Nearly 50% of the low-income counties served by Planned Parenthood have no alternative health-care provider. About 3% of its services are abortion-related, with the majority focused on providing contraception and screening for treating sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Despite these bursts in activism, the same thing that made the march an overwhelming success — it drew half a million in Washington alone, or twice as many as expected — also makes it hard to measure its long-term impact. Many of the women who streamed into Washington in buses, trains and planes are busy mothers, working professionals or older women who already fought the battle over women’s rights in the 1960s. “We won’t live long enough, most of us, to see the damage done by any Supreme Court appointees that are going to be made during the Trump administration,” said Marcelle Leahy, wife of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. “This is such an important time. You’re all geared up and I want you to go home and keep on going,” she told a breakfast before the march. Read more: Many marchers expressed interest in getting involved, but didn’t have concrete plans. Joan Treistman, who came from New York City to the march, was heading for lunch with her friend and daughter. It was her first time in public activism, and she left resolved to stay active. She said she planned to be in contact with her senators and local lawmakers as well as talk more with her friends about issues important to her. She had mixed emotions leaving the parade. "It's the intersection of exhilaration being at the parade, and sadness that we have to be so vigilant" of government, she said. Samantha Schindler and Samantha Woodman flew all the way from Seattle. On their flights they connected with a group of people who do community outreach and they've decided to join. Claire Wexler, a social worker from Baltimore, said she intends to keep donating to Planned Parenthood. She also left the march compelled to contact her local lawmakers on issues. One of the most tangible impacts may be more women deciding to run for office. Women first began to run for office in the 1920s, after passage of the 19th Amendment granting the right to vote. Yet they weren’t truly successful until the modern women’s movement during the late 1960s and early 1970s, according to Susan J. Caroll’s The Book of the States. Since the mid-1970s, women greatly increased their numbers in state government. Yet, progress has slowed in recent years, and nationwide statistics show little or no growth in the numbers of women serving in state-level offices since the turn of the century, according to Rutgers data. This may be partly due to the increasingly polarized nature of politics, says Erin Vilardi, who founded VoteRunLead. “It doesn’t look like a place where you can get anything done, so that’s a turn off,” she said. Women also tend to undervalue their qualifications, she said. Yet, since the election, her group has been overwhelmed. “My cellphone rang for one week straight,” said Vilardi. “It was both in a sad way about not getting to the mountaintop, but also in a ‘it’s time for me’ way,” she said. Trump is also the first U.S. president with no military or government experience. Women are realizing “I don’t need to hold myself to these ridiculous standards. The ship is sinking, I’ve gotta jump on board,” she said. Read more: There’s many causes to latch on to. The Women’s March’s platform calls for equal rights for women but also racial and economic equality; anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans; access to affordable reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion; criminal justice reform; an increase in the federal minimum wage; immigration reform; and protections for the environment. While the women who came to Washington cited broad concerns, a majority say it’s still better to be a man in America and sexism remains a problem, according to the first major survey on gender following the election. Trump’s Cabinet is 90% male and 90% white. And, according to the poll by the nonpartisan research firm, Perry Undem, the biggest predictor of getting more politically involved — more than ideology, age, gender, race and geography — is negative feelings about Trump’s comments and past behavior toward women, including bragging about sexual assault. “We always say that women run because they want to fix something or when they’re mad as hell,” said Muthoni Wambu Kraal, a senior director at EMILY's List. “Watch out for the one who is both.” Contributing: Dustin Racioppi, The (Bergen) Record; Nicole Gaudiano and  Eliza Collins, USA TODAY Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Join the Conversation To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment Top Videos More Stories

Woof. Velodyne Auto Tech by Andrew Krok January 19, 2017 8:01 AM PST @andrewkrok Up Next Watch how an engine warms up, thanks to a thermal camera Many companies rely on Lidar when developing autonomous cars, but the technology is still pretty darned expensive. Velodyne hopes to change that with its new megafactory. Velodyne was the first company to market Lidar for use in cars, and it's hoping to keep its grasp on that market with a gigantic factory aimed at producing boatloads of Lidar emitters. Its new megafactory in San Jose, California, hopes to produce 1 million units each year by 2018. It is already producing the company's flagship HDL-64 sensor. Enlarge Image If you see an autonomous car with a rapidly spinning component on top, that's the Lidar sensor at work. Wikimedia Commons Combined with Velodyne's claimed breakthrough in Lidar sensor design, this production ramp could bring Lidar unit prices below $50. That's ridiculously impressive, considering Google paid about $73,000 for each HDL-64 during development of its self-driving cars. Currently, units still cost thousands of dollars, if not tens of thousands, each. Lidar works by measuring the distance to a target with a laser . It can produce maps with very high resolution, which makes it an important tool for all manner of craft, from autonomous cars to the military's unmanned aerial vehicles. Lidar sensors traditionally take the shape of a can or puck, like the one that lives atop the hood of Faraday Future's FF 91. While many automakers are using this technology in their self-driving cars, there are a few holdouts, most notably Tesla. The electric automaker currently relies on radar, cameras and ultrasonic sensors for its Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system, and it doesn't appear to have any plans to change that arrangement in the future. Not every company intends to work with Velodyne, either. Back before Waymo split off into its own entity, parent company Google started working on an in-house Lidar solution for its self-driving cars. The autonomous Chrysler Pacifica, which Waymo showcased at the 2017 Detroit Auto Show, includes the latest version of that bespoke emitter.

And that doesn’t include the many thousands of people who took part in the main event — The Women’s March on Washington — for which there was no official crowd estimate. CNN did not make its own crowd estimates, but compiled official estimates from law enforcement agencies for many of the “sister marches” around the country that drew large crowds. There were other marches in cities around the world. Estimated numbers from marches around the U.S. have been compiled in a Google spreadsheet. A high estimate of total participants reaches 4.5 million. It is estimated that half a million people marched in New York City. Marchers planned events in many cities outside the nation’s capitol. CNN looked at media reports citing law enforcement figures in many of those cities. Crowd sizes became an issue in Washington Saturday when Trump visited the CIA and during remarks to employees there, accused an unnamed news organization of misrepresenting the attendance for his own inauguration. “We had a massive field of people,” he told the US intelligence agency. “You saw that. Packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I’m like, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, ‘Donald Trump did not draw well,'” the President said. “It looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument and I turn on, by mistake, I get this network, and it showed an empty field. Said we drew 250,000 people. Now, that’s not bad. But it’s a lie,” he said. It wasn’t clear which outlet Trump was referring to. CNN has not reported a specific size to the crowd since there has been no official estimate. Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer went on a tear against the political press for reporting on crowd size. The National Park Service, which oversees the National Mall, has been instructed by Congress not to offer crowd size estimates. “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period,” Spicer said, although evidence suggests otherwise. Photos of Trump’s inauguration compared to Barack Obama’s in 2009 and also to the Women’s March suggest the President drew a smaller crowd, although there could be other reasons, including a heightened security perimeter on Friday for the inauguration that was not in place on Saturday for the Women’s March and protesters on Friday, who obstructed entrance points to the inauguration and parade route.

Published on Jan 19, 2017 by Marian McPherson Staff Writer Key Takeaways Artificial intelligence, such as Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri, will only grow smarter in the coming years. Tracking the who, what, where and when of our day-to-day lives can make an "internet of you" that anticipates and delivers product suggestions and personalized recommendations. An "internet of you" would enable agents to take client data spread across various platforms and combine it into one place. Get Inman via Facebook Messenger Our top headlines delivered once a day. by CareyBot Over the past year, tech wizards and enthusiasts alike have been heavily pondering the future of artificial intelligence (AI). This week at Inman Connect New York (ICNY), Zillow Group founder Rich Barton said AI, such as Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, will only grow smarter in the coming years. Another ICNY panel discussed the usage of automated chatbots to engage clients, and a number of real estate portals are using “neural networks” that enable computers to evaluate and suggest homes in the same way a human appraiser would. Big data is now open Adrienne Meisels, CEO and founder of myPlanit, is determined to combine elements of AI and big data — the who, what, where and when of our day-to-day lives — to make an “internet of you” that anticipates and proactively delivers product suggestions and personalized recommendations. “We’re entering an age of personal big data, and its impact on our lives will surpass that of the internet,” she said. Meisels said technological transformations come in 20-year waves, each time taking a piece of technology and moving it from the back rooms of big companies to the hands of consumers. The latest emerging transformation is in the realm of big data. The information that has until recently only been available to business enterprises and the government is now available to you to improve your “health, wellness, happiness and productivity,” she said. Each time we turn on our smartphones, conduct Google searches, slap FitBits on our wrists or install new smart thermostats in our homes, we’re giving over a treasure trove of information on habits and preferences. That information is then used to provide recommendations for people like us, who share the same careers, interests and habits. “The game-changer will be the ability to make sense of all this data so that the average consumer can interact with it, learn from it and use it,” Meisels said. Making your apps talk Meisels said the next step in making technology more “human” is by enabling it to mirror how our brains instinctively contextualize and connect the “who, what, when and where” of our days seamlessly in one place. Right now our information is spread among a bevy of apps that all speak “different languages,” making it impossible to “speak to each other” and contextualize information to give recommendations that are specific to you, and you only, she said. Meisels said users don’t want an internet of a thousand different apps that they manually have to connect; they want an internet of “me” that can predict what they want before they ask for it. According to her, it would look something like this: You have a 9 a.m. meeting programmed into your calendar, and the calendar “asks” if it can pre-order a chai tea latte (your favorite drink) from a nearby Starbucks. On your way to get the latte, your phone notifies you that due to an accident, you’ll be five minutes late. An email is automatically sent to meeting members notifying them you’ll be late, and it makes another pre-order for a round of coffees to bring them for the inconvenience. When it comes to the real estate world, Meisels says an “internet of you” would enable agents to take client data spread across various apps and platforms and combine it into one place — something her new app, myPlanit, does.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Glenn Kessler By Glenn Kessler January 22 Follow @GlennKesslerWP During a briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer accused members of the press on Saturday of "deliberately false" inaugural coverage. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe.” —White House press secretary Sean Spicer, remarks to reporters, Jan. 21, 2017 “I looked out, the field was — it looked like a million, million and a half people.” —President Trump, remarks to the CIA, Jan. 21, 2017 The column has been updated It’s rather remarkable that the Trump White House has decided to make easily disproved claims about the size of the inauguration crowd Friday. On the face of it, there is no reason Trump should have expected bigger crowds than Barack Obama drew in 2009 and 2013. The Washington area leans left. Trump earned only 4 percent of the vote in the District of Columbia. Among the areas served by the Washington Metro, Trump received 8 percent of the vote in Prince George’s County, less than 15 percent of the vote in Montgomery County, less than 17 percent of the vote in Arlington County and less than 30 percent of the vote in Fairfax County. Trump may believe he heads a new national movement, but that movement does not exist in the D.C. metropolitan area. Given the animosity of the election, it’s fair to say that Hillary Clinton voters were not motivated to attend his inauguration. Further, the political leanings of the surrounding area help explain why the Women’s March on Washington on Saturday drew a substantially larger crowd. Nevertheless, let’s examine how wrong these statements are. The Facts Spicer, in his tongue-lashing of reporters, offered little evidence to back up his claims — and what he did say was wrong. He did not respond to requests for additional information, either via Twitter or email. “This was the first time in our nation’s history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.” False. Floor coverings were first used in 2013. It’s actually astonishing a White House press secretary would get such a basic fact wrong in a prepared statement from the podium. A simple Google search would have helped.

I took this photo at the inauguration in 2013. pic.twitter.com/MVHPQQ6Y5F — Ashley Killough (@KilloughCNN) January 21, 2017 “We know that from the platform where the president was sworn in, to 4th Street, it holds about 250,000 people. From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument, another 250,000 people.” Spicer appears to imagine that simply because a space can hold this many people, this many people attended the inauguration. But there is ample evidence that the crowd on Friday did not extend to the Washington Monument. THE CROWD: now ends at about 10th st on the mall. pic.twitter.com/iCjmAYPgcr — Lisa Desjardins (@LisaDNews) January 20, 2017 #PEOTUS arrives in 15 minutes and this is the crowd (or lack thereof) at 12th Street. W @bterris #Inauguration #InaugurationDay2017 pic.twitter.com/hFChmRACCs — Gillian Brockell (@gbrockell) January 20, 2017 Marcel Altenburg and Keith Still, crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University in Britain, analyzed photographs and video taken of the Mall and its vicinity for the New York Times and concluded that about 160,000 people were in those areas in the hour before Trump’s speech. By contrast, they said, at least 470,000 people were in those areas for the Women’s March as of 2 p.m. on Saturday, the time of the march’s peak density. Crowd estimates, of course, are not definitive. Both Friday and Saturday were overcast, meaning no satellite images are available. Satellite images would certainly provide consistent perspective. From Trump’s perspective at the Capitol, the crowd must have looked massive. But other images, extending over the Mall to the Capitol, clearly show fewer people than at Obama’s inaugurations. In 2009, an estimated 1.8 million people attended Obama’s first inauguration. In 2013, the number attending Obama’s second was estimated at 1 million, making that the third largest. About 1.2 million people are believed to have attended the swearing-in of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. A combination photo showing, at left, the 2009 inauguration (Emily Barnes/Getty Images) and at right, the 2017 inauguration (Lucas Jackson/ Reuters) “We know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama’s last inaugural.” This is also false. The actual numbers are 783,000 trips for Obama in 2013 — more than double Spicer’s figure — and 571,000 for Trump in 2017. There were 1.1 million trips for Obama in 2009, the biggest day in Metro’s history. The number for Trump is actually lower than the average weekday ridership of 639,000 trips. Again, we must emphasize that Spicer provided these numbers as part of a prepared statement. There is simply no excuse for such a basic failure to do due diligence in double-checking facts. What was the second biggest day in Metro’s history? Jan. 21, 2017, for the Women’s March. BREAKING: Jan. 21, 2017, was the second-busiest day in Metro history, with 1,001,613 trips. #wmata — Faiz Siddiqui (@faizsays) January 22, 2017 “This was also the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.” This also appears to be a false claim. The Secret Service denied the use of magnetometers to reporters. A USSS spokesperson tells us no magnetometers were used on the National Mall for Trump's inauguration. — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) January 22, 2017 According to two senior law enforcement officials, magnetometers WERE NOT USED in the areas Spicer said they were on the Mall. — Michael S. Schmidt (@nytmike) January 22, 2017 In any case, our colleagues at PolitiFact said that a 2017 Congressional Research Service report noted the use of magnetometers in previous inaugurations. Also, even if magnetometers were on the Mall, this does not explain the sparse crowds for the parade. Trump today: "We had a massive field of people. You saw them. Packed." Yesterday: pic.twitter.com/GZEtBn5ydm — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) January 21, 2017 “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe.” This was Spicer’s summing-up statement. As seen above, his previous claims leading up to this sentence were false, so it already lacks credibility. The “in person” claim is simply wrong. But there is no explanation for why he believes the audience was the largest ever around the globe. We have not seen global data, but in terms of U.S. television viewers, Trump already falls short. According to the preliminary data from Nielsen for inauguration coverage, 30.6 million television viewers in the United States watched Trump’s swearing-in, 19 percent below the audience of 37.8 million for Obama’s 2009 inauguration. The record-holder for an inauguration TV audience remains Ronald Reagan, who attracted 41.8 million viewers in 1981. We will update this as more data comes in, including viewership via live streams. Update, Jan. 23: At a news briefing, Spicer tried to claim that he was speaking about the largest audience worldwide, even though virtually all of his presentation on Jan. 21 was about in-person attendance. He claimed that “tens of million of people” watched the event online, though he provided no evidence that was the case. Streaming data is not apples to apples with TV viewership, as it could reflect how many times someone tried to connect. (Ten attempts does not equal ten people.) Akamai Technologies, which delivers content to leading broadcast and newspaper customers, said Trump’s swearing-in was largest single live news event that the company has delivered. At its peak, 12:04 p.m., that meant 4.6 million concurrent viewers, according to spokesman Chris Nicholson. In 2009, Nicholson, Akamai estimated 3.8 million peak concurrent viewers for Obama’s inauguration at its peak. Terabits per second traffic appears eight times higher in 2017 than in 2009, but that is mostly a reflection of higher-quality video, he said. Given that Akamai provides online content for just about every major broadcaster and many newspapers, it’s clear that Spicer’s revised statement does not add up either. Combining the TV and online figures, though it’s a bit of apples and oranges, still leaves Trump short of Obama’s 2009 numbers (and Reagan’s numbers as well). The Pinocchio Test This is an appalling performance by the new press secretary. He managed to make a series of false and misleading claims in service of a relatively minor issue. Presumably he was ordered to do this by Trump, who conjured up fantastic numbers in his own mind, but part of a flack’s job is to tell the boss when lies are necessary — and when they are not.

The company promised that the device "will be the most disruptive since the advent of the smartphone in 2000", which means that it's planning to top Apple's announcement of the iPhone in 2007 and Google's introduction of Android in 2008. Naturally, the firm still hasn't told us how it will do so. Originally set to arrive in 2016, the handset was soon delayed due to 'regulatory hurdles'. We haven't heard much from WhartonBrooks recently though, not since the company announced the cellular bands of its upcoming Cerulean Mobile phone. Today, the company finally teased an image of the device, even though it was covered in bubble wrap. The final samples are on their way from Shenzhen. Fingers crossed that they are ready for the testing labs. Should we name them? pic.twitter.com/wyNOK8JnqZ — Cerulean Mobile (@ceruleanmobile) January 22, 2017 It's hard to tell much from the image, but the metal frame with rounded corners suggests that the phone will indeed look like the images that the firm has shown on its website (seen above). Some had speculated that these earlier images weren't the actual phone, as it was so early in the handset's development when they were published. There's still quite a bit that we don't know about the Cerulean Mobile phone, such as its specs, how much it will cost, its name, or how the firm plans to revolutionize the smartphone industry.

Mr Evans said English job centres could help Scottish jobseekers into work and accused an SNP motion calling for the full rollout to be suspended of not taking into account the lower tapering rate which reduces the amount of benefit that low-income workers lose as their wages rise. The Weaver Vale Conservative’s comments came after Glasgow South MP Stewart McDonald said some of his constituents would have to take up to three buses on an eight-mile round-trip to reach a job centre under planned closures. Mr Stewart said ministers had relied on Google Maps for their proposals and branded this ‘Government by Google’. The motion tabled by the SNP also requested for future job centre closures to be suspended. Mr Evans told the SNP to learn from England. He said: “The Scottish Government – the SNP has a majority in the Scottish Parliament – have the power to provide discretionary payments in any area of welfare, including to top up reserved benefits, as well as to create new benefits in reserved areas. If SNP Members really want to change welfare in Scotland, they would be better off speaking to their colleagues in the Scottish Government. “Conservative members know that the way out of poverty is work, not welfare. “Since 2010, 2.7m more people are in employment, with more than 1,000 jobs created every day under the Conservative Government. “We have introduced a new national living wage, giving people on low wages a pay rise, and lifted 4m people, and rising, out of income tax altogether.” Jobcentre Plus said there no plans to close branches in Runcorn or Widnes.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The oldest TV technology is getting popular again with cordcutters Mike Wehner BGR NewsJanuary 22, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share We’ve all heard the term “cord cutting” more times than we can stand, but it often seems like, despite the fact that many cable and satellite customers talk about it, very few people are actually axing their pay-TV services in favor of something else. A new study suggests that while it might not seem like many people are actually going back to over-the-air TV, the movement is actually gaining some serious traction. According to the report, a full 15% of households with broadband connections have gone back to TV via antenna exclusively. Don't Miss: You won’t believe how much Amazon is charging for Google’s Pixel XL “Pay-TV subscriptions have dropped each year since 2014, falling to 81% of U.S. broadband households in Q3 2016,” Brett Sappington, Senior Director of Research with Parks Associates, said of the data. “Several factors have played a part in this decline, including growth in the OTT video market, increasing costs for pay-TV services, and consumer awareness of available online alternatives.” It’s important to note that many of the cord cutters are likely not relying solely on their local broadcasters for content, but are instead embracing streaming services in place of their traditional cable or satellite options. Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and even Twitch are starting to seriously make a case for themselves as primary video services, rather than supplementary add-ons alongside a monthly cable bill. Still, it’s an impressive figure that seems to be growing rather steadily, and with dissatisfaction in many cable providers at an all-time high, it’s hard to imagine this trend doing anything but growing for the foreseeable future.

Paul Sawers@psawers January 22, 2017 6:03 AM Tags: flying cars, top-stories Above: Personal air vehicle flying above a solar-powered city, flying car of the future: 3D rendering Image Credit: Shutterstock Investment in autonomous vehicle technology entered overdrive in 2016, and 2017 is gearing up for more of the same. In the last six months of 2016, the first public self-driving taxi service hit Singapore roads, courtesy of NuTonomy, while Uber followed suit a month later in Pittsburgh. The question of self-driving cars becoming a reality on roads around the world is no longer an “if,” it’s a big fat “when.” Amidst all the hullabaloo over driverless automobiles, another transportation revolution is gaining momentum. Flying cars have been at the center of fantastical future visions in science fiction for decades. But despite the best efforts by Star Wars, Blade Runner, Back to the Future, and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang to cajole engineers into making fantasy a reality, it has never quite happened. However, things are changing. Earlier this week, aerospace giant Airbus confirmed that it plans to test a prototype of a self-piloted flying car by the end of the year, with the ultimate aim of circumventing the growing gridlock on city roads. Airbus CEO Tom Enders said of the plans: One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground; now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground. We are in an experimentation phase; we take this development very seriously. With flying, you don’t need to pour billions into concrete bridges and roads. The company didn’t commit to any figures for its investment, or the ins and outs of what the planned demonstration will entail, but the company’s efforts to bring personal flying vehicles to skylines is in line with efforts we’re seeing elsewhere. Last month, fledgling startup Lilium Aviation announced a €10 million ($10.7 million) funding round from Skype cofounder Niklas Zennström’s Atomico for a jet with vertical take-off and landing. While it’s not strictly a “car,” insofar as it doesn’t have wheels, it shares a similar mission to that of Airbus by seeking to alleviate gridlock — “everyone can fly anywhere, anytime,” the company proclaims. “Our cities are heading for perpetual gridlock, choked by an ever-growing number of cars  —  1.2 billion today, rising to an estimated 2 billion by 2035,” a Lilium spokesperson said at the time. Pricing for the Lilium jet remains a mystery for now, but it will fit two passengers and will have an estimated cruising velocity of 250 to 300 km/h (160 to 190 mph), and a range of around 300 km (190 miles). The Lilium jet is still a prototype, but the company has previously committed to flight testing in early 2017, ahead of commercial production. Lilium has also declared that it expects many businesses to emerge as a result of such vehicles, including air taxi and ride-sharing services. Above: Lilium Aviation Airbus and Lilium are just two of the latest companies to join the race to make “flying cars” a reality. Massachusetts-based Terrafugia was founded in 2006 by five pilots and MIT graduates and has developed working prototypes of roadable aircraft. The company recently received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that will help pave the way to getting unmanned passenger vehicles in the skies by 2018. Roads? Some of the biggest names in technology are looking to a future in which personal flying vehicles are a thing. Google cofounder Larry Page is backing Zee, a stealth startup founded in 2010 that is “designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B,” as the blurb on the company’s homepage notes. It now counts some 150 employees who are working on a “small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically,” according to a Bloomberg report from last year. That’s not all. Page is also backing a second secret flying car startup called Kitty Hawk, which is headquartered just a half-mile away from Zee in Silicon Valley. “Over the past five years, there have been these tremendous advances in the under­lying technology ,” Mark Moore, an aeronautical engineer at NASA who designs advanced aircraft, told Bloomberg. “What appears in the next five to 10 years will be incredible.” Elsewhere, Uber recently released a whitepaper that anticipates a time when on-demand urban air transportation is widespread, possibly within a decade. “On-demand aviation has the potential to radically improve urban mobility, giving people back time lost in their daily commutes,” the paper reads. “Just as skyscrapers allowed cities to use limited land more efficiently, urban air transportation will use three-dimensional airspace to alleviate transportation congestion on the ground.” Uber’s vision is thus: A network of small, electric aircraft that take off and land vertically (VTOL, for Vertical Take-off and Landing) will open up routes between cities and suburbs, reducing the time it once took from hours to a matter of minutes. Above: Uber’s fantastical future vision Challenges If there are challenges involved in making self-driving cars a reality, the obstacles facing flying cars — autonomous or otherwise — are ten-fold. Safety will likely be the number one concern, which will lead to heavy regulatory obligations for any company considering putting vehicles in heavily populated, built-up conurbations. Then there are issues related to noise, emissions, and technological capabilities — the latter being the part of the puzzle that is receiving most attention at the moment. Basically, the idea is: “Make flying cars possible, and worry about the other things later.” And that philosophy does make sense. There is little point worrying about regulations and environmental factors until you’re at the stage of being able to put personal flying vehicles, other than helicopters and planes, in the sky. The technological capabilities are perhaps at a far more advanced stage than many realize, but there is a way to go yet. Airbus’ Silicon Valley arm, A³, is running Project Vahana, the self-piloted flying vehicle platform we mentioned earlier. A³ CEO Rodin Lyasoff reckons much of the technology is already here, which is why his team is so confident that they’ll be ready to run a test later this year. “Many of the technologies needed, such as batteries, motors, and avionics are most of the way there,” explained Lyasoff. But one of the remaining challenges, one that cannot be underestimated when operating fast-moving vehicles in built-up areas, pertains to the “sense and avoid” sensors that ensure the vehicles can circumvent obstacles off their own volition. Sure, we’re seeing many cars go to market with such smarts built-in, including Teslas, but “no mature solution” for airborne vehicles currently exists, according to Airbus. “That’s one of the bigger challenges we aim to resolve as early as possible,” noted Lyasoff. It’s difficult to imagine a time when hundreds or thousands or millions of airborne vehicles are traversing skies around the world — though this vision has been the centerpiece of an imagined future for more than a century. But with the proliferation of self-driving cars and a growing sense that we’re on the cusp of a major technological revolution, the very notion of “flying car” suddenly becomes more tangible. “We believe that global demand for this category of aircraft can support fleets of millions of vehicles worldwide,” added Lyasoff. “In as little as 10 years, we could have products on the market that revolutionize urban travel for millions of people.” That so many companies are now working toward a future in which “flying cars” are a mainstream transport option makes it easier to imagine a time when this really will be a reality. Whether that’s in five years, 10 years, or 50 years remains to be seen. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

I would like to get a copy of his service records. Can I find these records online anywhere? A: You can find his records, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. For some people, finding these documents is a matter of curiosity: What did Uncle Joe do during his years in the Marines? Where was he stationed? What was his final rank? For other families, these records can be necessary for securing veterans’ benefits. Just be wary: This digital library is expansive and free to the public, and having access to so many historical documents and photographs can be addicting. Click here to access military personnel records. Keeping hackers out of your router Q: Is it possible for hackers to get into your router and see every password you enter? It seems like a way around security software. A: This is a very perceptive question because your router is likely the most vulnerable access point in your house. Why? Most people don’t even think about their router, much less its susceptibility to getting hacked. They may stock up on virus protection and change their passwords monthly, but someone has already commandeered their router and can see everything. So how do you check the security of your router? Click here to quickly find out quickly whether your router has been compromised. How mobile is your mobile? Q: We’re going to Europe this summer. What’s the best way to use my phone overseas? A: Depending on the country, you can use your smartphone just as easily abroad as you can at home. There are often limitations, like China’s endless war with Google, or bad connections in the jungles of Honduras, but most places offer unprecedented flexibility and signal strength. The easiest situation is to find a phone that is “jail-broken,” meaning that its use isn’t restricted to a certain provider and that it can accept just about any SIM card. Click here to find out how to cheaply use your phone cheaply in another country. Find a better weather app Q: The weather app on my phone is lame. Today, it said it would snow. I’d like to know when and how much. Am I asking for too much? A: Good point. Most default weather apps have a hard time keeping up with dynamic meteorology, like the ever-changing storms of the Midwest, or the wide range of temperatures in my home state of Arizona. This is especially annoying for travelers and outdoors people, who want an accurate forecast to prepare. The good news is that there are lots of weather apps designed to help you anticipate heat waves, snow flurries, and gray skies. The bad news is that not all of them are great. Click here to find out which weathers apps are the sunniest for users. Caught them all? Apps like Pokemon Go Q: I liked Pokemon Go but now it’s getting boring. Are there any other apps like it that I should try? A: Pokemon Go was the first “augmented reality” super-hit, and you can bet that 2017 will bring a wide range of sequels and imitations. So far, there aren’t a lot of games that capture the same obsessive thrill as Pokemon, but augmented reality apps are about to take the world by storm. The best ones right now are fun and educational, and they’re suited for the whole family. Always wondered where to find Orion’s Belt? Wondering what you would look like with a tattoo?

Its also brought some trouble to Galaxy devices. Advertisement We’re starting to hear about some of the Android Nougat problems plaguing Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge users and today we want to take a look at everything you need to know as we push away from the release date. Last year, Samsung released an Android Nougat beta for select Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge owners. It gave users a chance to try the software and its features ahead of the official release date. It also gave testers a chance to report bugs. While the Samsung’s Galaxy Nougat beta wiped out several issues it seems some Nougat problems have slipped through the cracks into the final release. Earlier this year, Samsung started rolling out its Android Nougat update. The release is starting with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge though it will expand to devices like the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 in the first half of the year. Advertisement Samsung’s version of Android Nougat brings some outstanding changes to the UI, to the popular Multi-Window mode, and more. It’s an exciting update. While many Galaxy users are doing fine on Nougat, others are struggling with some frustrating issues. It’s early but we’re already hearing about problems with Samsung’s version of Nougat. With that in mind, we want to take a broad look at the early Android Nougat issues affecting Samsung’s Galaxy devices. This roundup includes a look at the early issues, some resources for those running into trouble, and a look at what’s next from Google and Samsung. How to Prepare for Your Android Nougat Update The first thing you need to know about Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat problems is that they are unpredictable. Advertisement While many Galaxy smartphone and tablet users will emerge from the installation process without any major headaches, others will encounter small bugs and major issues with the new operating system. This is why we recommend doing some prep work before you install Nougat. A little preparation can go a long way toward preventing issues. To help you, we’ve put together a game plan that will take you some of the steps to take before installing Android Nougat on your Galaxy device. You don’t need to take every single step but at the very least you’ll want to make sure you’ve backed up all of your important files. If you’re new to Android or you simply want to cover all of your bases, take a look at our walkthrough. It could help you prevent Android Nougat problems. Samsung Galaxy Android 7.0 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about issues plaguing Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge users that have installed Android 7.0 Nougat on their device. Samsung Galaxy S7 owners are complaining about Wi-Fi issues, issues with the camera, issues with sound/speakers, abnormal battery drain, busted Bluetooth, lag, and installation issues. @jspring86az Is it maybe Grace UX that's causing issues with Samsung's battery life? My S7 edge on the Nougat beta has AWFUL battery. — Angel AR (@AngelARTech) January 19, 2017 I'm loving the new android update 7.0 @Android but wow it drains my battery twice as fast @SamsungUK #s7edge 😕 — Michael Almond (@mickalmond) January 19, 2017 We expect the list to grow as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android Nougat updates hit more devices in more regions around the world. This is precisely why you should prepare your device for the Android 7.0 Nougat update. This is also why you should take your time with Nougat. Yes, it’s an exciting update but if you’re having a solid experience on Android Marshmallow (or something older like Lollipop), you’ll want to really dig into Nougat feedback before making your move. Where to Find Feedback About Nougat As we push away from the start of Samsung’s Android 7.0 roll out current and future Nougat users need to keep an eye on feedback. If you own a Samsung Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, now would be a good time to start taking a look at feedback from those who are on the Android 7.0 Nougat update. This feedback will alert you to potential Nougat problems as well as the potential benefits of installing the new operating system on your device. Ultimately, this feedback could help you decide if you want to install Nougat on day one or wait for Samsung/your carrier to roll out a bug fixer to address issues. The first place we recommend is XDA-Developers. We also recommend digging through feedback from the users on Android Central Forums. These are two excellent resources and they’re worth bookmarking. Once carriers start pushing out Android Nougat you’ll want to head to carrier-specific forums on XDA-Developers or the official forums at carriers like AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. We’ll see a ton of feedback emerge there. You should also use social media sites like Twitter to gather valuable feedback from your fellow Galaxy users. How to Fix Galaxy Android 7.0 Problems If you do run into an Android 7.0 Nougat update on your Galaxy device there’s no need to panic. There’s a good chance you’ll be able to fix your issue from the comfort of your chair. We’re in the process of putting together a list of fixes for common Samsung Nougat problems. In the meantime, you’ll want to take a look at our list of fixes for the most common Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge problems. If you’re dealing with weird battery drain you’ll also want to take a look at our list of fixes for bad Galaxy S7 battery life. XDA-Developers, Twitter, Android-centric forums like Android Central, and carrier forums are also great places to look for fixes. What’s Next If you can’t find a fix for your Galaxy Android Nougat problem know that you’ll probably be on your own for a few weeks at least. We expect Samsung and its carrier partners to push out periodic bug fixes to address Nougat issues. Unfortunately it’s a slow process and there’s no telling when we’ll see the first batch of Nougat bug fix updates roll out. Samsung will continue to roll out monthly security updates to its Galaxy devices though there’s no guarantee they will have bug fixes on board. It’s also worth noting that Samsung’s version of Android Nougat update is based on Android 7.0, not Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Android 7.1.1 is the most up-to-date version of Nougat. It’s unclear when or even if Samsung plans to deploy Android 7.1.1 and its fixes to Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Google’s reportedly cooking up an Android 7.1.2 update for later this year so it’s possible that Samsung opts for that update instead. For more on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, take a look at our walkthrough. 10 Things to Do Before Installing Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow Get Familiar with Android 6.0.1 & Marshmallow   1 / 10 Let's start with something very important.  One of the first things you'll want to do is get familiar with the changes coming with your version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Each update is going to be a little bit different (carriers can't help themselves) but there some core elements to each.  There are a number of resources around the web but we'll provide you with some great starting points right here.  We've taken a deep dive into the differences between Lollipop and Marshmallow and you'll want to check the basics out so that you're comfortable with the changes.  Android 6.0.1, the version of Marshmallow rolling out to Galaxy devices, is a little different than Android 6.0. You can get familiar with some of Android 6.0.1's basics right here. And then we get to the device level. That is to say that the Galaxy S6 Marshmallow update is a little different than the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update. We've outlined some of those differences and you can find them at the links provided.  Things will be different at the carrier level as well and you'll want to look into those changes as well. Unfortunately, those changes will arrive whenever Samsung and your carrier decide to push out Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for your device. We'll provide you with the Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow release notes as an example.  If you haven't been following along, now is a great time to look into the new features and enhancements so that you're as proficient as possible after you download and install Marshmallow on your Galaxy phone or tablet.    1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Even Trump’s supporters raised the alarm for everything from gas attacks to a nuclear bomb. As it was there was some trouble and some people were hassled and/or injured. Reply ↓ Hana M. January 22, 2017 at 8:04 am Many of the voters who swung the electoral college to Trump are hurting too much economically to be able to afford a quick trip to D.C. on a working day. To quote Robert Reich in Lambert’s article at NC: The economy is not working for most Americans. The economic data show lower unemployment and higher wages than eight years ago, but the typical family is still poorer today than it was in 2000, adjusted for inflation; median weekly earning are no higher than in 2000; a large number of working-age people—mostly men—have dropped out of the labor force altogether; and job insecurity is endemic. If you are holding down two jobs, if you would have trouble meeting a $400 emergency bill, if your car is on it on it’s last legs, if your own health is poor, how the heck are you going to manage a day trip to D.C.?

Think Trump will be delivering that? I don’t. It takes a leftist! Traveling all the way to DC will always be an ordeal for many though, for one thing it’s pretty far away from much of the rest of the country. It’s only local to the Northeast pretty much.

Plenty of women showed up anyway (one said her husband went to the march; another came with her wife), so we handed control of the party to them. I’m looking forward to the results; very impressive group. Anybody that can organize a Green Party chapter in Astoria, Oregon is one heck of an organizer.

DNC et al, for voter fraud and collusion against Bernie Sanders and supporters during the primaries. The website is http://jampac.us/DNCLawsuit/ . All thus far filed documents are posted here. Thanks, Buzz Meeks Reply ↓ Arizona Slim January 22, 2017 at 10:38 am And then there was seating. Unless you were a VIP, you had to stand for several hours. Reply ↓ Pavel January 22, 2017 at 3:09 pm I think this is all a bit of nonsense. Recall that the polls stated over and over that both Trump and HRC were distrusted if not despised by the majority of voters. At the end, slightly more people went with Trump than with Hillary, though many of these were unenthusiastic and many were just using Trump to send a giant “FU” to the elite (as happened with the Brexit vote in the UK). Thus it’s not surprising that these tepid Trump voters wouldn’t bother going to the Inauguration. If HRC had won, she would have had more attendees, since her natural voters live in the Acela corridor and (as noted above) have more money to spend on travel etc. Still, it’s going to be a long 4 years if there is a media battle with Spicer over every such minor story. Reply ↓ Vatch January 22, 2017 at 3:52 pm At the end, slightly more people went with Trump than with Hillary Actually, more people went with Hillary than with Trump. They just lived in the wrong states, so more electors went with Trump than with Hillary. Okay, I’ll admit that electors are people, too. :-) Reply ↓ scott2 January 22, 2017 at 5:49 pm The people on food stamps in LA county alone could have swung the popular vote, 1.3 million of them. Reply ↓ Oregoncharles January 22, 2017 at 4:48 pm Actually, substantially more PEOPLE went with Hillary, but Trump got more STATES. A serious glitch in our system – not that I wanted Hillary or voted for her; but it’s hard to claim “democracy” when the person who got more votes didn’t get the job. Reply ↓ Pavel January 23, 2017 at 4:24 am I stand corrected, Vatch and Oregoncharles. I should have specified: in the Rust Belt battleground states, more people “broke for” Trump at the last minute than for HRC. But one can’t claim HRC should be president or “won the election” — she did win the popular vote, but that’s not how the damn system works! As for any “democracy” claim, that ship sailed a long time ago. The US elections are a complete and corrupt joke. Reply ↓ Procopius January 24, 2017 at 4:10 am Oh, for goodness sake! Since I was little I’ve been told, every four years, “After all, we don’t live in a democracy, we live in a representative republic.” Said with a kind of whiny sneer that claims moral and intellectual superiority. Get over it. Reply ↓ Yves Smith January 22, 2017 at 4:57 pm Um Hillary did win the popular vote by a big margin, but it was due to big majorities in CA and some blue cities. And Trump voters who could not attend in person could have watched on TV but I take the point re having to work. The reality is Obama’s election was a historical event, which meant unprecedented interest, and at a key historical turning point (the crisis!). The Trump team is looking ridiculous, unless this is an effort to divert attention from the women’s march and to raise doubts about crowd counting (which is always exaggerated, favorably by organizers and unfavorably by the opponents, who are usually the establishment but not here). Reply ↓ H. Alexander Ivey January 22, 2017 at 11:53 pm Ah…Well, if I was teaching an IELTS course (a course in English language proficiency where English accuracy and fluency is judged), and the Task 1 writing (which is the writing section for describing information displayed on a chart or graph) showed two charts; one showing the popular vote totals for Clinton, Trump, and Stein, and the second chart showing the electorial vote totals for Clinton, Trump, and Stein, the student would get full marks if they described the popular vote totals as ‘very similar’, ‘not significantly different’, or ‘almost the same’, and they described the electorial votes totals as ‘quite different’, ‘largely for Trump’, or ‘a significant amount more for Trump’. In the IELTS system of describing the differences between two numbers, any difference less than 5% is described as small to quite small, 5 – 15% as significant, 15-25% as large, and more than 25% as quite large, quite significant. I believe that the statisticians would say that the difference in the popular vote between Trump and Clinton is insignificant, within the error of counting – what? the election is not on the up and up??. What most people are missing is that the most significant number is the number of those who could have, and chose not to have, voted. About 50%. That number dwarfs both Trump and Clinton. Reply ↓ Yves Smith January 23, 2017 at 1:10 am The vote percent in favor of Hillary is large by any measure given the divergence with Electoral College results. Reply ↓ Steve C January 23, 2017 at 12:49 am The more we’re talking about crowd size the less we’re talking about the worst Cabinet in history. Trump seems to think he can distract and misdirect through the next four years. But why not? It worked for Reagan.

The Ripple, a New York–based women’s collective, is sponsoring a trip for 100 women. The Louisiana chapter of the Women’s March has 42 seats left on its bus. The Michigan Education Association is chartering five buses for the occasion; LatinasInBusiness.us is organizing a trip from New Jersey; and the Alabama chapter of the Women’s March is offering transportation scholarships. Reply ↓ beth January 22, 2017 at 4:26 pm My understanding was that that was why we had a local women’s march and a state capital march. I really am not on the inside of the Dem organization locally. Reply ↓ diptherio January 22, 2017 at 1:41 pm While Reich is quite correct, it would behoove “the Left” that he be removed from his position as policy pitch-man. He may have apologized and seen the (obvious) error of his ways since assuring us all that NAFTA was going to be good for American workers, include enforceable labor protections, etc., but I think that a lot of those laid-off manufacturing workers remember him specifically…and not in a fond sort of way. If a surgeon assures you that amputation is necessary, and then lets you almost bleed out after cutting off the wrong leg, you’re going to be unlikely to listen to his medical advice in the future, even if he happens to be correct the next time…just sayin’. Reply ↓ RabidGandhi January 22, 2017 at 2:30 pm Agreed, but did Reich really apologise for Nafta? The most I heard him say was that some tweeks should have been made to include labour. The turd needed more polishing, it turns out. Nafta was such a huge blow to the people in all three signatory countries that Reich should never be allowed anywhere near any type of policy discussion.

Reply ↓ Vatch January 22, 2017 at 3:57 pm He also said that the environmental portions of NAFTA needed modification. Change both the labor and environmental parts of NAFTA, and we’ll end up with a substantially different agreement. Reich was unequivocal in his opposition to the TPP, and that implies a genuine change of heart. Reply ↓ RabidGandhi January 22, 2017 at 6:45 pm Sorry, not convinced. Perhaps the biggest effect of Nafta was that it dumped hugely subisidised US grains onto the Mexican market. Since Mexican farmers– efficient as they are– couldn’t compete with the subsidised prices, masses of Mexicans were pushed into destitution, and hundreds of thousands fled northward across the border, creating the migratory wave of the late 1990s. This was not due to a lack of having the right clauses or worker protections; rather this was the essence of Nafta. It is a devastating treaty at its core, and no amount of lipstick will make it prettier. Reply ↓ Vatch January 22, 2017 at 9:45 pm Well, a couple of million unemployed Mexican farmers sure seems like a labor issue to me, but I can understand why one would look at this from a different point of view. Reply ↓ rd January 22, 2017 at 5:14 pm Canadian healthcare costs are half the US cost per capita. This is a clear unfair competitive advantage for Canadian workers. Trump should insist that US pharmaceutical companies be allowed to increase their prices in Canadian markets without limit to whatever the pharma company wants it to be. Canada should also be forced to pay specialists far more as well as buy lots of additional unnecessary medical equipment to even the playing field. US health insurance companies should be allowed to enter the Canadian market to disallow coverage to any patients who are silly enough to require procedures.

It’s fairly common on the Italian Left to suspect that they were infiltrated or directed in some way by Italian or American or other intelligence agencies, but whatever position one takes on that issue, it’s difficult for me to see how one can regard their role as historically trivial. Reply ↓ alex morfesis January 22, 2017 at 11:58 pm Not suggesting anyone is trivial…just not real in a sense they have anything to do with their public persona nor pronouncements…. there are some, when cornered with facts, who will attept to cloak the realities with some argument of needing to make compromises to obtain resources… I do not see this great “groundswell” of anyone, left or right, taking up arms or running around making things go boom… Not sure if this is good or bad, but certainly have had my share of quiet conversations with parties on both sides of the spectrum who either participated in fighting off hoover or imagined pres. obama would not surrender the oval office and they would have to deal with it…(it’s the south…lots of guns…lots of talk…too many weapons to actually keep clean…) The world is full of beer muscled bafoons… it is easy to claim one will take up arms…it is something else to actually watch someone take their last breath… But are they not trivial…they ate up column inches but how many could name three organizations and what they actually did or claimed to srand for without having to run off to wikiland Reply ↓ Oregoncharles January 23, 2017 at 1:55 am Weathermen.

That isn’t inconsistent with some of the points you bring up. In particular, Weatherman was almost spectacularly counterproductive (starting with the famous “Days of Rage”), and the Red Brigades arguably helped to turn Italy away from radical politics. UserFriendly January 22, 2017 at 11:39 pm There are plenty of violent people out there and plenty of them voted for Hillary because ‘Trump is Hitler’ was pushed SO hard. I’m shocked none of them have cracked yet. The problem is if any of them do anything the whole left gets the blame. Reply ↓ Oregoncharles January 23, 2017 at 1:49 am Yeah, I’m that old. The tone is very different today. Nonetheless, rocks do get thrown and windows broken – but no bombs, as yet. I think the window breakers are out of step with the rest. No, there is not the culture of rebellion now that there was in the Days of Rage. this is more comfortable, but I have to wonder how effective.

Reply ↓ Jim Haygood January 22, 2017 at 8:40 am Hell, the number of Obama supporters in Palm Springs was reduced too, for a different reason: Obama’s plane was still circling the Palm Springs airport. Heavy clouds and rain had descended, making it too dangerous to land. The airport was still on a security lockdown for his arrival, and travelers began to complain loudly about their late flights and missed connections. A voice over the loudspeaker announced that the 90-minute ramp freeze had been lifted, and passengers began boarding their long-delayed flights. Obama’s plane was being diverted to March Air Reserve Base, about 60 miles away. On the sidewalk near the resort community’s guardhouse, a small group of cold and wet well-wishers stood vigil. By 8 p.m., about 20 people were on the sidewalk. “It’s such a bummer for there to be so few people,” said a mother who came with her two children. “Maybe he’ll understand that it’s California and its raining.” http://tinyurl.com/hek54fc Calians will never get that wet stuff that comes out of the sky: Why today?

My personal explanation is that Trump supporters stayed away because the “Chocolate City” has large populations of Black and Gay people. I mean “they” are everywhere. “They” even had their own inaugural events (See “Hundreds Of Queer People Held A Guerrilla Dance Party Outside Mike Pence’s Home And you have to see it to believe it” at HuffPo). Real people that Trump supporters don’t want to acknowledge actually exist except as problems to be controlled by punitive legislation.

Obama won the presidency campaigning as The One bringing “hope and change”. Trump won the presidency (with a minority in the popular vote) making a wide range of big populist promises — many of which will be difficult or impossible to fulfill (e.g., boosting employment in manufacturing, and rebalancing trade with China). Neither entered office with a plan to fulfill their promises. ================================================= I have always believed that the modern media and the office of the presidency have conspired to turn the office into something akin to the Wizard of Oz.

Evidently there’s a big store room of furnishings somewhere in White House, and the incoming president or family members are given a tour and allowed to pick and choose anything they’d like installed before their arrival. Here’s a link to a WaPo photo gallery of past oval office decor: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/gallery/2010/08/31/GA2010083103664.html It looks like Obama initially chose gold drapes; it’s hard to tell because of variations in photo color. Bush-43, definitely gold. Reagan’s were double, with gold underneath deep red. None of them, however, come close to Clinton’s. I’m not sure whether I’d call those gold, bright yellow, or just plain ugly. Funny thing is, those “Trump gold” drapes appear to be the same ones (see photo gallery images 4 & 5). http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/west-wing/oval-office.htm Extra: Here’s a link to smarmy article about Obama’s underwhelming remodel in 2010.

From a 2001 WaPo article: On Inauguration Day 1993, Nelson Wurz, draper to the president, stood patiently at the West Gate of the White House, waiting for Bill Clinton to be sworn in. When the call came that the oath of office had been administered, the gates parted and Wurz rushed to the Oval Office. He had only a few hours to complete his mission: to hang the lush golden presidential draperies he had just completed, and to do it before the Clintons came “home.” … On that frantic day, Hockersmith watched carefully as Wurz and his team installed the silk swags she had designed to replace the Bush blue cotton damask curtains, designed by A-list New York decorator Mark Hampton. Hockersmith says the “strong gold damask” happened to be a pattern once used by George Washington. That day was just the beginning of a presidential decorating marathon, as Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton swatched their way through more than 25 rooms–two floors of stately public rooms plus the upstairs private quarters of the White House and the woodsy cabins of Camp David. Because both the president and the first lady are passionate about White House history, they took an active role in the renovating and refurbishment. Evidently it was one of the most expensive redecorating projects in White House history, and some of the “donations” received through Hockersmith were issues when the Clintons left “dead broke” and took furniture with them. http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/news/cl-15562 Reply ↓ oh January 23, 2017 at 9:02 pm Funny, I could’ve sworn that Bill liked blue (like in Monica’s blue dress)!

Ideologically, the Women’s March leadership is clearly in the Clintonian tradition, else Emma Goldman, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and many other union/left figures would be presented as exemplars, and they’re not. And their principles are rights-driven, not universal benefits-driven. So it all looks solidly Third Wave, to me. (I mean, it’s terrific that there were whole airplanes full of women flying to DC to march, but women holding down three jobs, or going to school and working, weren’t on those flights.) I’d also like very much to take a look at the national leadership, and especially at their funding. And the Democrat establishment being what it is, they’ll certainly attempt to hijack the movement by decapitating its leadership, as they did the leadership of Black Lives Matter (a process that was horrible to watch). That said, there will have been all sorts of cross-currents and action at the local level that isn’t about Democrats; and it is, after all, entirely a good thing to march against “grab them by the pussy,” further assaults on “reproductive rights,” equal pay, and all the rest. Now, whether the mobilization translates to organization is another thing, and that’s where the danger of the Democrat establishment hijacking it come in. Reply ↓ Lori January 22, 2017 at 3:51 pm I almost skipped the Sacramento march due to my skepticism about leadership…right down to the Shephard Fairey art work that flooded my facebook feed in the two weeks leading up. I’m so glad I didn’t. Even here, with the state capitol as the gathering point, the marchers and speakers mostly did their own thing…politely listening, but then overtaking and outshining the Dem establishment figures that were present selling the familiar messages. Don’t know where any of this leads, but there was nothing business as usual about it, which made it pretty darn exhilarating. Reading the facebook recaps this morning, leadership seems gobsmacked themselves about the scale and what happens next. Here, they’re saying it took on a life of its own. Best they’re coming up with is send postcards to your Senators or hook up with that #indivisible thing. Reply ↓ Oregoncharles January 22, 2017 at 5:10 pm “And the Democrat establishment being what it is, they’ll certainly attempt to hijack the movement by decapitating its leadership, as they did the leadership of Black Lives Matter” Which is one reason Occupy never admitted it had leaders ( it did, of course; I saw them in the march in Portland). Not that it did them much good in the end.

This needs to be said now, by guys on the left. There’s an awful lot of “ha ha, ‘grab her by the pussy’ is just how men’s brains are organized and it was always thus, and all men have the same thoughts,” and if none of those arguments can be verified, and they can’t, trot out, “Can’t you just take a joke?” This stuff gets tiresome, fellas. You can be better than this. Reply ↓ Oregoncharles January 23, 2017 at 2:21 am It;s awfully clear that Trump is a classic jerk and sexual harasser. Fortunately, that kind of behavior isn’t all that common – or perhaps I’m naive, as well as shy. However, first: that comment about “grabbing” was in the conditional; he said that he could, not that he did (he may have). Second: the interesting thing about it is that he was talking, in a surprisingly self-aware way, about the perqs of power. “power is sexy,” as someone said. This is not a joke; it’s fairly basic biology, working itself out in human terms. The point was that they let him. That was primarily because most of them wanted something from him. That doesn’t make him any better, he’s still taking advantage; but it does make the phenomenon essentially universal. I suspect it applies to both sexes, but there haven’t been enough women in power yet to be sure. Maybe we should ask some. Reply ↓ Yves Smith January 23, 2017 at 2:58 am The other part, as female friends mine who know the entertainment business harrumph, that there is lots of casual sex (as one said, “Why do you think they have trailers on movie sets?”), and pretty much all the women who have successful careers slept aplenty with powerful men. As one of them said, “When will we see one of those women on the cover of Vogue or Vanity Fair tell young girls who think they want to be actresses what it really takes to get ahead?” (no pun intended). So his specific comment wasn’t about Trump being a rich guy per se, it was the perks that go with being an influential guy in the entertainment biz. Reply ↓ ekstase January 23, 2017 at 10:52 pm There are people everywhere who behave with self-respect, and who respect women. As we’ve learned from Bill Cosby, they aren’t all lining up to degrade themselves. There are people in every field who won’t associate with creeps or be creeps. Maybe we just don’t learn their names. And there is a long list of women who have complained about this guy’s abuse of them. Treating or trying to treat women as things is repulsive and pretty crazy.

Reply ↓ ambrit January 22, 2017 at 11:27 am The quote is apropos, but consider; the jihadis in the Middle East also fit the role of “coffin ready.” Thus, what the “coffin ready” support and aim for is very important.

And those fake friends haphazardly cultivated in trendy urban centers with abundant corporate job opportunities will be among the very first to shoot you for that last bit of peanut butter at the bottom of the jar when they miss two meals because the store shelves are empty. Cultivating as friends a pack of entitled, cosmopolitan dilettantes who will turn into crazed zombie jackals the moment even a minor hiccup interupts their privileged lives, and then pretending like that’s an authentic substitute for real relationships with local community minded people who know how to make do and survive even without money.

Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob January 22, 2017 at 11:24 am Not if everyone is moving all the time. At one time the ‘job creators’ were part of the community. They lived there and started businesses there. The Walmartization of everything has destroyed that. You either sell out to the big companies or go out of business. I moved to a large city and stayed for a decade for a decade – after that decade I was one of the oldtimers in the city as the population was fairly transient. Most in my circle were more recent transplants than me. I did find a ‘community’ of a sort but after a decade it was broken up and gone after the neighborhood started to gentrify. But it was never a real community for me – I hadn’t grown up with or gone to school with and wasn’t related to any of these people. Not many there really knew me or each other in the way a true community does, where people know your history and your family’s history, etc. You’re not judged solely on what you did recently but on your whole body of work so to speak. You have elders whose reputations you trust to whom you can look for advice, etc. It takes a while for these types of community relationships to build, decades or more. You can’t recreate it in the same way after packing up to go where the new jawb is. Reply ↓ jrs January 22, 2017 at 2:02 pm I think maybe a lot of people long for this at a very deep level to be valued as something other than an economic commodity. Now for a woman for a certain part of life she will also be valued as a breeding or potential breeding commodity (and after that just as a market commodity again). But beyond that there’s just the market and people are what they are in the market (having friends etc. is of course all well and good and adds greatly to well-being but doesn’t mitigate this at the deepest level, because it’s more primary). Reply ↓ JCC January 22, 2017 at 12:13 pm I am one of those who has often moved to where the jobs are, from cities and towns in Connecticut, New York, Florida, California, and the US Army in Korea as well as very long term contractor work in Iraq. Being a relatively friendly and out-going person, I can say with some confidence that developing friends, place, and community no matter where you move to is true only if you believe that a very small and very limited and probably very temporary subset of friends, place, and community is equivalent to that of your home town. It’s not. With the exception of maybe one or two, when you move the friends disappear, new friends have to be made and the sense of place and community have to be rebuilt from scratch. It’s a long and difficult process, particularly as you age. And it is never equal to what you had in the community of friends and close relatives that you started with. The hardest part is that, even if you could go home again, almost everyone else has left, too. In the U.S., it seems that almost everything is transient nowadays and a “real sense of place” is almost non-existent for many. And that is a problem. Reply ↓ Carla January 22, 2017 at 1:08 pm @l.a.b. and JCC — Thank you for these thoughtful comments about your experiences. I have lived in the same community all of my life, feel fortunate to have done so, and have no desire to leave it. People left in waves, after high school and then college. My daughter moved for work and, now in her 40s, has lived in 5 states. Despite the fact that I stayed put, my 2nd husband (the good one) died when I was 50, two of my closest friends died around the same time, another somewhat after, two local 1st cousins have passed away, and since I turned 60 two close friends have moved out of state with new husbands. Many of these losses are an inevitable result of growing older. Still, I sorely miss all these important people and cannot imagine moving away from the dear friends and other familiar elements of community I still rely upon here in NE Ohio. Reply ↓ Patricia January 22, 2017 at 4:04 pm You believe neolib framing when you think it is fine to repeatedly move for a job. One of the many problems it causes is that one become divorced from a sense of place and disconnected from the earth. One develops little sense of how climate/plants/animals/insects are changing over time–and that erases urgency in the face of genuine crisis. Reply ↓ Susan C January 22, 2017 at 6:38 pm Sometimes life is not lived based on any type of belief system or “framing” of such but rather for reasons that are not easy to understand but necessary just the same for your survival. It is important to not bring in political beliefs to the table when making a major change or taking a risk, unless that is part of why the change is being made. I very much applaud the poetic nature of what you have said – but in fact you can get in touch with the earth and its tiny and not so tiny inhabitants when you move to a place where nature is fully on display – and move for that purpose. I just moved and love it. It was risky and I didn’t know how things would turn out. But inertia can overtake the best of us which can cause us to not to move forward in the ways that we need to. If I may add one additional thought – my age group (60s) had different life experiences which may have made us less risk adverse. Our families wanted us to move out of the house upon graduation so just about everyone got married, had roommates or struck out alone. There were jobs then but recessions too so it was scary to do but that is how it was then and what society expected. Reply ↓ Patricia January 22, 2017 at 10:04 pm Hey, Susan C, we might be somewhat at cross purposes. Yep, there are reasons why moving might be best. It’s the foisted-upon and serial nature that I find problematic. I’m generalizing, of course, when I say that a healthy culture is made up of people who understand/cherish their lands and can hold long-term friendships. Individually, one does what’s necessary to get by, if that is the position one is in. But if one can choose…. Until I was 34, I didn’t live for more than 4 years in a place. It wasn’t all that good for me. I finally landed in the midwest, not choosing the area, but stopping. Over time, I’ve become attached (tho’ I still miss pacific northwest). I am 60. I think stability is more important for people in this era than when I was young. Putting down roots is one of the better defenses, for plebs, to a disintegrating society/economy. If we can manage it, if we can choose—solid communities, dependable friendships, gardening experience, etc are advantages. And developing such takes a decade, at least. Reply ↓ Susan C January 23, 2017 at 12:42 am Patricia – I agree with everything you are saying especially that we have intrinsic personal needs for more stability right now. To have more security in my own life I moved in 2015 about 2000 miles to a part of the country that has a lower cost of living but it took five moves in this town to find the right neighborhood where I feel comfortable and safe as well as a place where there are jobs of some sort or another. In one way I did a lot of research on this market but in another it happened all by serendipity. And I loved the big move and all the little moves when first arriving. When I look back at my life, my best decisions were my moves as I found them enriching and rewarding. Even in bad economies. Reply ↓ Patricia January 23, 2017 at 5:53 am I wish you well, Susan C, getting to know your place: the soils and rocks, the lay of the land, the plants and creatures, how the winds blow and moisture arrives, the qualities of light and dark. Staying long enough to pass through familiarity’s contempt into deeper affection. May more of us be able to wrench such choice from our current economic system. Particularly the young.

Reply ↓ Praedor January 22, 2017 at 9:51 pm The military paid for my college education instead of my parents. It gave me a good job with major responsibilities and egalitarian pay and chance for promotion. It helped me acquire self discipline, courage (under literal fire), and have me rotated friends. It provided me with universal single payer healthcare (including vision and dental). it’s going to provide me with an actual pension to supplement my social security (newer recruits are going to get ripped off with 401k type garbage). The military has lots of upside. Not so great when you get shipped off to fight in wars of choice in order to maximize profits for mega corporations or to steal other people’s natural resources.

So then the question becomes HOW? Well I suspect by taking desperate measures: cramming more and more people into a tiny apartment, doing a super long commute out to where the rent or housing is cheaper, living in a not very good neighborhood etc.. So it’s inaccurate in a sense to say that places are unaffordable when a lot of poor people manage to live in them and thus afford them. It’s in some way even disrespectful of their lived experience. They are unaffordable at what many people would consider a decent standard of living that much is true!

Reply ↓ Susan C January 22, 2017 at 12:20 pm And taking a risk – Reply ↓ cwaltz January 22, 2017 at 1:41 pm Yes, but in this society when you take a risk and it fails the assumption isn’t that you were unlucky but that you lacked skills. At some point there should be some awareness that it costs money to continually look for where the jobs are and some point those resources can and do run out and at that moment you are pretty much stuck where you are. People like to blame those at the bottom for their predicament but it may very well be that the ” capitalist system” hasn’t provided them the resources to continually live like nomads searching for mythical jobs to support themselves. Reply ↓ jrs January 22, 2017 at 2:38 pm Yes either a risk is actually a risk or it’s not. Rich kid (maybe Donald Trump :)) playing with some small portion of daddies money – not a real risk. Putting some discretionary income in penny stocks – maybe stupid but not a real risk. But actual REAL risks have the potential to backfire spectacularly because they actually ARE risks. And risks a person who gets most of their income from labor takes that jeopardize that income (really jeopardize it, not just take a pay cut when you can still get by on it) are real risk. Backfiring spectacularly in a society with little safety net is potential poverty, homelessness etc.. Then when people end up poor which is a potential outcome of a real risk (a real risk has a real downside) and is unable to afford housing or even just unable to afford medical care or other basic necessities, we BLAME THEM. Even though we keep saying people should take risks! Reply ↓ cwaltz January 22, 2017 at 3:17 pm Building on that idea, no one gets to choose their parents. Donald Trump may very well have worked hard to accrue his fortune but he was LUCKY that he had a parent with resources to give him a million dollars to start his empire and to bail him out when things turned downward. http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-dad-bailed-1970s-avoid-bankruptcy-article-1.2818893 The median wage in 2014 was 53,000 and some change. That means half the country doesn’t have a million dollars to give tell the next generation they birthed to go out there and take some risks and fail spectacularly. The best thing they can do is encourage them NOT to take risks so they don’t end up paying the consequences for that risky behavior.

How about this for a story: An E.E. friend of mine worked for years at a company well known for manufacturing supercomputers. He’s highly skilled both at coding and hardware work. He was making about $100K Canadian. Then his entire department was fired and outsourced. He was completely unemployed for two years, only got some sporadic employment for the next year. About two years ago he finally got back to work full time in a job that uses his skills to their fullest and pays something close to what he was making before. This is a guy who was fortunate enough to graduate back in the early 80’s into an economy that had high demand for E.E.’s, he had very low student debt because University tuition was quite reasonable at the time in B.C., didn’t have to shovel money into a terrible health insurance plan because we have single payer AND was able to buy a nice condo back in the late 80’s before Vancouver housing prices went crazy. He was in an extremely good position to cope with the crash compared to most people but even in his case it took ages for him to get back to almost the same situation he was in before he was laid off. How much more difficult would it be for someone with no savings (or huge debt)? Someone who needs to take care of an aging or ill relative? Someone who doesn’t have credentials that the market is looking for right at this moment? He DID have those credentials and still found it difficult. Personally I’ve done the education and training dance and have been very successful at getting very good grades in both an academic business program and a trades program – both the government and industry groups were claiming that there was high demand for graduates in the fields I chose which was part of why I went into them. Results so far – nothing. In fact, I’ve made more money at playing music than as either an accountant/book keeper or an aircraft mechanic. And I’ve only made about a hundred bucks playing music… I should also point out that this has all taken place in one of those cities that we’re supposed to believe have all sorts of jobs available. Reply ↓ Susan C January 23, 2017 at 1:16 am Yves- I think you are addressing me by your comments. Moving to a new location for job opportunities is risky and not without peril but it can work and often does as you make it work. It is true that employers no longer want to pay for relo but there are ways to get set up temporarily and then move your own stuff in on your own dime and take it off your taxes, or you make a deal with a new employer to have them pay you off the top so you can move stuff in and then have the lower salary moving forward. For me, I always relished moving as I found it personally rewarding. To learn about new places and new parts of the country and meet new people. Reply ↓ ambrit January 23, 2017 at 3:14 am The kicker here is that most relocations entail the forsaking of most physical possessions and the enduring of a period of rootlessness. Making new friends is not easy in the best of situations. I did the multiple move trip as a child. Kids pick up anxiety and depression from their parents easily. They depend on their parents and identify with them during the growth season. Remember the exhortation, “It takes a village to raise a child?” That was village, not bus station. Reply ↓ LarryB January 23, 2017 at 12:56 pm Have to second what Yves says here, I was an Air Force brat, and also attended 10 different schools before college. It is incredibly cruel to children, it stunts them emotionally and socially, you can’t really develop any true friends during the time when you are supposed to be learning how to form these attachments. Not to mention the interruptions in your schooling, different places have different curriculum, and they don’t always mesh together well. All in all, it’s a real bad deal for kids.

Reply ↓ Lee January 22, 2017 at 3:31 pm I believe this urge to see what’s over the next hill is genetically built in to many if not most of us and could be particularly true among European settler populations and their descendants. The problem is whether or not a new location is capable of providing the necessities of life (such as other peoples’ land and resources) when you migrate or explore. Given our current level of population and resource use we can no longer be assured of a welcoming social or physical environment once we hit the road. Also, most species usually travel in strongly bonded social groups over very long periods of time allowing for evolutionary or learned adaptation. Reply ↓ HotFlash January 22, 2017 at 4:34 pm Well, that and a few little things like the enclosure of the commons, the 100 years war, the potato famine (blight across Europe, but only a famine in Ireland — interesting, that), the fact that all the land was already owned and had been for centuries, and the weapons superiority of the European ‘colonists’ over the inhabitants — but yeah, genetics, for sure. Reply ↓ makedoanmend January 22, 2017 at 9:51 am Yep, there was a reason that Motown occured where it did. It centralised transport, manufacturing expertise at all levels and reduced costs directly and indirectly by reducing supplier network distances and energy usage. There were quite a few cities across the industrialised world that “naturally” grew this way. If one wanted to move in order to change work or pursue new opportunities, one was free to do so. Or one could prioritise other activities like rearing a family and pursuing hobbies by selling one’s labour (at somewhat decent wages) and stay put. Today we obey the “natural” markets and the more rational one is the more one obeys. We also use more energy and reduce the quality of life. This is called progress.

Reply ↓ Eclair January 22, 2017 at 11:38 am Well, two points here: we are taking as unexamined the capitalist definition of ‘jobs,’ or ‘work.’ That a ‘job’ is a gift from a person who has power over you, and that you, the worker, are at the mercy of that powerful person. You, therefore, must scurry around, begging for work; you might even have to migrate. If we define a job as the work done to make our community a better place for all, then our jobs are more closely tied to the places we actually live. And, there seem to be be two types of people (at least at the poles); those who are natural wanderers, always looking over the horizon, and those who are happiest staying in the place where they were born. I am a wanderer, mild variety. My husband is happiest just staying put.

The English who wandered to America, and now when America speaks, Europe listens (as in Merkel’s ‘We are ready to compromise in areas we can, my Might Orange Haired One). There are probably other examples for wandering that I can’t think of right now. And for staying home to be advantageous as well, Posters are welcome to add to this. Reply ↓ jhallc January 22, 2017 at 12:22 pm My guess is that all this moving around for better (paying I’m guessing) jobs took place in the 60’s and 70’s based on the commenters age. Back then there were jobs to be had in other places and especially, if your parents (likely the father) hapened to be management and wanted to move up the corporate ladder you moved around a lot. If you were blue collar union you could move and find other work, but the incentive was not as large since you lost seniority (pension) if you left your union job. Those good union jobs are gone and moving to find a job is most likely going to result in a reduction in pay these days. Who wants to uproot themselves and their family just to become a greater at Walmart? Reply ↓ knowbuddhau January 22, 2017 at 12:35 pm I think this kind of rootlessness is one of our many problems. I live where I live because I love living here. I’d rather be just barely making it here than live in a city. Twice a day, four times when I work my night job, I get to drive through some of the most beautiful landscape in the country. If you’re familiar with Deception Pass, at the north end of Whidbey Island, WA, you’ll know what I mean. The other morning, as I drove over the bridge at 4:40am, the full moon was hanging over Deception Island, filling the pass with a broad swath of moonlight on the water. As one who practices Zen, it was deeply moving. Later that night, returning from my night job, the moon was on the other side of the bridge. Can’t get that in a city. Can’t even see the stars at night. It’s never that quiet or dark in a city. And when I’m coming home, I drive along part of the same route my school bus took over 40 years ago. I’m not just *from here, I AM here. I can’t even imagine what it’s like for people who’ve lived and died in this region for literally milennia, who’ve buried their ancestors here, who have a relationship of kinship with the land, plants, and animals that most of us settlers know only as objects interesting for their decorative value. “Ooh, look! An eagle! How lucky we are to live here. God I hope it doesn’t build a nest on our property.” They like to frame the Cascades or Olympics or the Salish Sea (aka Puget Sound) in the picture windows of McMansions built on glacial till bluffs, but don’t mind at all if the runoff from their fancy landscaping poisons the water. (Hood Canal, at the south end, has been just about killed from runoff. And we’ve only been here a couple centuries. Some people managed to live here for milennia, and in the company of cathedral forests and rivers overflowing with big, beautiful, healthy salmon. There connection with the lands and waters is visceral. Maybe we should ask them for some advice. People of lesser means get crowded together in tiny apartments. No pets, no garden, no real, visceral, daily experience with the island qua island. And since the local economy is just about a wholly-owned subsidiary of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, making your own way is tough. What sense of belonging, what sense of actually loving the land and how it orients one to the micro- and macrocosms, do people have who are only here for the money? And often a pittance at that. How motivated are they to defend the rights of the lands and waters not to be polluted for their own sakes? This land isn’t sacred to them, it’s just more god-forsaken dirt far, far removed from the Holy Land. Nothing special about it at all. No urgency in protecting it from depradations for corporate profit. If it gets too bad, just move on, right? No wonder they feel awful. Going from a crowded apartment to a crowded parking lot, to a crowded commute, to a job – not a livelihood! – that dehumanizes and demoralizes you a little more every day, with the greatest connection to the world at large coming through electronic media, separates us from the places we inhabit. It’s already living in a kind of virtual reality, just with the Google goggles on the inside. Belonging to the land, being it in an immediate and unmitigated directness, is worth much more to me than a shiny new car. Still, I would like to be able to make enough to support myself now and into a dignified retirement. I drive a lot more than I’d like to. I’d like to live within a short bike ride of work. I’d like to give more back to the community and land that made me what I am. How we do that without despoiling the lands and waters is the problem. Giving up and running away, only to find the same soul-destroying conditions everywhere else, is not our only option. Reply ↓ Isolato January 22, 2017 at 1:47 pm Hey There KB, Just drove by Deception Pass the other day as I made my way from my non-ferry served little island in the San Juans to Seattle where I lived downtown for 20 years.

Reply ↓ Montanamaven January 22, 2017 at 5:19 pm Might be a good spot to mention that I took the advice of a commenter here to read Oldenberger’s “The Great Good Places” and Christopher Lasch’s “The Revolt of the Elite and the Betrayal of Democracy”. I found a great good place in a small town in upstate NY. Since moving there part time I’ve met county workers, a guy working on the new Tappan Zee Bridge, an Amtrak worker, a TV director, a few lawyers, a community banker, a chef, local police and firemen. We’ve survived the election at the bar while the patrons in the restaurant are still divided up into either weepy Dems or happy Republicans. I can’t say enough about the importance of sliding on to the bar stool after the work day and mixing with people who are in very different lines of work than mine. I love to hear them tell stories of this community that most have lived all their lives. And they have welcomed me, a wanderer, and made me feel at home. The suburbs and exurbs killed these third places. And it was one reason I did not take to Los Angeles when I worked there for a couple years. If you have no third places like bars or hair salons or cafes, you go to parties with like minded people with similar jobs. It’s because I hung out at this third place, I was not convinced Clinton would win. I met several disgruntled Democrats who crossed over and registered Republican in the primaries to vote for Trump. Two words that I heard often were “corruption” and “condescension”. The elites in my other small town in Montana are looked at as overeducated idiots with no common sense. Except those that do sit at the bar. Yes, Margaret, there is such a thing as society. My current read is “Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism” by Peter Marshall. I just started the chapter that explains the anarchists are anti- state but not anti -society. Society is, as Thomas Paine pointed out, a blessing. Solidarity, sympathy, co-operation, mutual aid, initiative, and spontaneity” are elements of society which is “the most desirable condition of the human species.” Reply ↓ RMO January 22, 2017 at 11:58 pm There’s beauty in what you wrote.

The one I liked…uh, disliked….hmmmm, thought the most interesting was the last (the others are crony capitalists I already know about) “Robert Wolf is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of 32 Advisors and the Chairman of Measure – Drone as a Service®. Prior to his role at 32 Advisors, Robert was CEO of UBS Americas and President of the UBS Global Investment Bank. Robert was appointed by President Obama to President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board from 2009 to 2011, the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness from 2011 to 2013, and the Export Council from 2013 to 2016.” The below is from CNBC (I know I get moderated if I put in too many links) “Washington, D.C.-based Measure announced Wednesday it completed a “significant” funding round for an undisclosed amount and will become independent from investment firm 32 Advisors. The 1-year-old “drone as a service” company uses the unmanned aircraft to gather data for clients in areas ranging from agriculture to insurance to disaster relief. The cash stream comes shortly after Measure cleared a major hurdle with the FAA, which can give exceptions for commercial use in the absence of blanket regulations for businesses. Earlier this month, it gave Measure permission to deploy more than 300 models of the aircraft, more than any other commercial operator.” And this is from Bloomberg Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg Wall Street A Top Fundraiser for Obama Turns From Wall Street to Drones “Wearing cuff links with the U.S. presidential seal, Robert Wolf was explaining why he loves drones and wants to help big companies fly them.” ====================================== “….cleared a major hurdle with the FAA…” Is being in Washington helpful? Is being on the Obama board helpful? Are presidential cufflinks helpful? Hmmmm….are they unique to each administration – because if my aim was to get some of those p*ssy protesters, and they think I got my cufflinks from the Trump administration, I don’t think I would have done to well…. And the question I always have, is how do people so interested in mo’ money, mo’ money, have so much time to “give” away….so interested in the common weal…public service…..must be why God blesses them so much.

Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner January 22, 2017 at 8:42 am Voter registration sucks. It’s often hot. People are mean. You need high morale to get people to do it, and sitting behind a desk or holding a clip board while saying nothing to people going by doesn’t count. The Democrats need a motivated base to get people to do registration and go back if they are doing It right. “Have you registered to vote?” “Are you registered? ” Do this for three hours in a non bourgeois safe part of the locality. That’s it. Rinse and repeat. More than three hours without a break causes a person to lose effectiveness. The local Democrats who didn’t do this the last go around, they know how to do this. They simply didn’t want to for one reason or another. Going to a rally where no policies are demanded beyond vague calls for some kind of unity and fightin’ back with like minded people isn’t difficult. It’s quite easy and probably fun. With registration and canvassing in general, you have to talk to strangers often in non-safe places like the outsides of libraries. I knew a girl who diligently went to the dump (three dumpsters in a county) every Saturday morning to register people because everyone threw out trash. She voted for Jill this last go around and hasn’t done jack politically since after the 2008 election. Reich is right on everything except unity with the Clinton people. The Democrats do need a full time organizing operation need to make sure areas are being reached and the awful, but enthusiastic, volunteers are being given dispatched to wave signs. If the morale problem is fixed, people will register and canvass.

The reason people such as myself stress “registration” is Dems depend on transients such as renters and students. You have to register in areas where the bourgeois types fear to tread, where the “deplorables” live because they move and registration is often not up to date. They wind up going to polls and can’t vote. Those tablers would have made a difference hitting poorer areas of the Philly area one weekend.

Several rounds, many hours, few registrations and it was finally abandoned. Nearby university not having much luck either and they planned one of their dormstorm events. I have no idea how it turned out. If people are online more and do more tasks online and online registration is easy, in person advocates are going to be ignored. You try to come up with possibilities for engagement…. So you hate all politicians? Well, have I got a deal for you… initiatives!! It was also embarrassing to explain to people the common errors and that they would have to follow-up to see if they were registered, and ahem, would have to do it again.

As I was eavesdropping, their conversation centered on some of the inappropriate comments Trump has made and thus disqualifying him as being fit for the Presidency. We all know this particular refrain. I butted in, and politely asked them why they can’t see that someone who thinks things we all do, some of them inappropriate, yes, and has the personality to voice those thoughts, no matter how detestable, isn’t that possibly a good thing? Perhaps frank honesty, bluntness and saying what you think, what you really think is perhaps a side of leadership that is not only refreshing but something almost neccessary? No bullshit. They literally were speechless and all four of them walked away from the bar area. It really gave me pause.

People voted for hope and change in 2008, and gave the Democrats a second chance in 2012. The Democrats blew it.

People like to accuse the liberals of being arrogant, boorish and smug. Well, if that is the case then how exactly do you think YOU appear when you automatically assume that because someone doesn’t have to a conversation with you 24/7 on your topic of choice that it must be because they aren’t capable of emotionally handling the conversation?

Second, the interloper asserts the right to interject countervailing evidence to rebut the argument propounded by the group of four. Which takes precedence, and why? It is a puzzlement. Reply ↓ cwaltz January 22, 2017 at 3:47 pm There was a saying that “Perception is reality” that was all the rage a few years ago. The funny thing about perception though is that it also can have two minds. One person may consider me funny and insightful while another might consider me rude and presumptuous. Neither one would really be wrong since in both cases they are basing their perception of me on their own personal value system and how they viewed the encounter. As a matter fact ,they both could be right since being insightful or funny doesn’t preclude a person from being rude and presumptuous too. *shrugs* I try not to read too much into my singular encounters with people since one encounter does not a full story make.

It’s also very interesting to me that although they are concerned about Trump, they understand that Clinton was not a better choice. (Apparently the MSM propaganda doesn’t extend to South America.) Also, I want to point out that my decision to leave the US predated Trump, although Bernie made me briefly reconsider. Finally, it has been interesting for me today to read the discussion about moving to find a job. Although a job is not why I moved, it has been a very lonely experience to be in a country where I don’t understand the language. Even though I knew many people in California, and had lived in the same city for 30 years, I didn’t really feel like I had a lot of close friends. Both of my parents are dead, so that made it easier. But I have three children in the US and part of the rationalization for leaving was to encourage them think outside of the (US) box.

Anyway, my point is that men and women can appreciate each other’s sexuality without necessarily being sexist. Reply ↓ Yves Smith January 23, 2017 at 3:28 am Sorry, this is not “redpilled.” I had plenty of women saying this was ridiculous. Anyone who has worked on Wall Street, and any woman not in an elite job has heard tons of male banter. I’ve been taken to strip clubs a half a dozen times and to hostess clubs in Japan a few times too. I find them intriguing from an anthropological perspective, particularly in NYC, where strippers are not prostitutes (any man who tries touching the women gets thrown out immediately, and even at sorta seedy strip clubs, the bouncers would make sure the women got into cabs when they left their shift). There is a high degree of variability of sex drive among men. One study found that how often men think about sex ranges from 2x a minute (no typo) to 2x a day. Reply ↓ Aumua January 23, 2017 at 11:39 am Of course sex drive varies! Of course people talk about sex, including men. This has gone so far from my original point, that I wonder if you’re not just trolling your own board, Yves. You’re holding up Wall Street, and elsewhere Hollywood as excesses as examples of normal (presumably healthy) behavior. Have I wandered into an alternate universe here? Ok, boys will be boys then, and “the bantz” makes it all good. I wasn’t saying that this thread was a “redpilled” discussion, just that there’s a slippery a slippery slope here we should be aware of. Reply ↓ Yves Smith January 24, 2017 at 2:54 am Have you managed to forget what this is about? Trump had conversation with another man that he though was off camera. Thus this was the equivalent of locker room conversation. I cannot tel you how many women and men said that to me, unprompted. On top of that: 1. Even though it’s really childish on a man of his age (then mid-50s), men (and even women) exaggerate about their sex lives. And Trump in particular exaggerates about himself routinely. 2. Even with that, he never said he did grab pussy. He said he could readily. It is ridiculous to get excited about this. Women coming forward saying they were fondled or harassed by Trump is another matter entirely. However, the Dems are total hypocrites on this front, since every woman who made allegations about Bill Clinton was treated as a liar with an agenda. And that includes Juanita Brodderick, who said Clinton raped her and has contemporaneous witnesses.

One for something strictly local, most for things I consider to be important on a state or national level. (And btw more than one of them had turnout on the Washington Mall equal to yesterday’s turnout there). Funny how easy everyone found those to ignore. Other than making us feel like we were doing something, it changed nothing in any of those cases, the wars went on, the jobs went away, the charter schools got the funding and the public schools suffered, the neighborhood supermarkets closed…. I’m going to be blunt: until you have the power to get laws written that impact their bottom lines, corporations don’t give a damn about marches. And to do that you have to Have the power to get people on the ballot who will follow through with your selected agenda AND get them elected. And until you can do that the politicians will help you when it costs them nothing and lie to your faces and sell you out when it will cost them large contributions and/or post retirement work. The marches MUST be a beginning of the work so that strength you think you have is real. Otherwise it isn’t and will be nothing but a fond memory for you and others. Look I know I’m cynical, but if even a quarter of those marching organize, campaign, register, and/or show up to work for their positions again again in numerous harder ways you are right you have power. If not like I said enjoy the memory. Reply ↓ nycTerrierist January 22, 2017 at 11:40 am Great piece on counterpunch addresses the limits of symbolic displays like yesterday’s march. Citing labor history, Magaray observes we never would have had a middle class without organized labor and a potentially violent push back against the status quo: http://www.counterpunch.org/2017/01/20/attention-feminists/ “It wasn’t the Congress who was responsible, it wasn’t philanthropic institutions, and it wasn’t the Church. It was organized labor. That was true then and it’s true today. If a woman wants to be assured of making the same rate of pay as a man, the only place where this is guaranteed in writing is within the confines of a labor union. Accordingly, instead of sending petitions to Congress, or holding demonstration at City Hall, or enlisting in Sisterhood buzz-groups, or writing scathingly clever op-eds for the New York Times, women should consider getting scary. They should consider doing what men dread them doing, which is to muscle up. They need to become union members. If women rightly think that it’s unfair for them to make 77-cents on the dollar compared to what men make, Feminists need to abandon their genteel intellectualism and rhetoric (no matter how eloquent), and do something scary. They need to embrace the “primitive.” All of which made Hillary Clinton’s “ornamental Feminism” during the campaign seem so phony. She couldn’t have it both ways, folks. She couldn’t be a glorified shill for Wall Street and, simultaneously, insist she favored “wage equality,” because those two views are contradictory. Wall Street is opposed to wage equality. Wall Street is opposed to labor unions. Sad to say, so is Clinton.” The sooner we move past ‘ornamental feminism’ the better. Reply ↓ Dave January 22, 2017 at 2:40 pm “If women rightly think that it’s unfair for them to make 77-cents on the dollar compared to what men make…” Send that myth to bed in the Shibboleth Inn. Pay equity requires doing the same dangerous jobs men do, with danger of dismemberment and death, in high cold and dank wet places, using your hands until they bleed and are numb, using upper body strength until your bones ache and you are bent for life, working the same number of hours that men do, jobs that don’t allow pregnancy leave, or “Could you help me lift this?” Of course, women get the pleasure, obligation and more important job of raising children, which if it were paid appropriately, would put them well ahead of men on “pay equity.” True equity would be all married men and women, especially with children, having to switch jobs every six months of the year. Reply ↓ Yves Smith January 22, 2017 at 9:37 pm Stop with the bullshit. Women are discriminated against in jobs that aren’t construction work. Tell me how many women are hedge fund or private equity partners, which is where the really big pay disparity is. Or partners in law and consulting firms. And why is construction work more valuable than nursing? Now some of this is due to career interruption to raise kids, but single women in pretty much every field are discriminated against. The same writing sample, attributed to a male name, is scored lower than when attributed to a woman. Women have to have 2.5 times as many peer reviewed articles published, on average, as men to get tenure in the sciences. Even Australia, a notably macho country, has a lower gender wage gap than the US., at 16-17% v. 23% in the US. Go read this article: http://www.auroraadvisors.com/articles/Fit.pdf Reply ↓ Dave January 22, 2017 at 11:32 pm I think the only fair sample to see if there is an average pay disparity is where men and women work together in the same job and have the same duties and in very large numbers. i.e. Retail clerks, bus drivers, nurses or doctors. Is there a pay disparity there? Places such as hedge fund or private equity partnersville, while unfair, are not AFAIK what the pay disparities models are based on though because of the small number of people involved and huge amounts of pay. If Bill Gates walks into a cafe, what does it do to the average pay level therein? How can you use women’s absence from these few super high paying jobs as a debit against their other tens of millions of income any more than you can impute value to all the working men in the country through the obscene pay levels of the BSDs? If you add up the amount of dollars paid to construction workers nationwide, where women are not represented, and thus are not there to be underpaid, I’ll bet it well exceeds hedge fund or private equity partner pay. Yes, nursing, care giving and teaching is more valuable to society than construction, no doubt about it, except when it comes to water systems, sewers, hospitals and roads. However, those are fields almost entirely owned by women. Are they underpaid for what they do? Of course. But so are the men who work those jobs. Thank you for a superb website and this forum. Reply ↓ Yves Smith January 23, 2017 at 3:46 am No, you have the causality backwards. Feminized professions are always underpaid. The fact that more women are becoming lawyers than men is a sign of its fallen status. On Wall Street, women over time find they are shunted from promotions, and wind up in the more difficult, lesser paid niches. These are supposedly hugely meritocratic firms, many of the women are single or have no kids, and the ones that do can afford hot and cold running nannies. The fact that there are no women in senior positions at top PE firms is a sign of male discrimination, since studies repeatedly show women are at least as good, and most studies find better, investors than men. Same pattern in law firms and accounting firms. And women do compete for these positions and are very rarely admitted into these clubs. And you clearly didn’t read the article. Get over your upper body strength fetish. Women are actively discouraged from getting strong. At my advanced age, I can carry well more than the 70lbs than the max airport baggage handlers are allowed by law to lift (I think the unions have gotten it down to 50 lbs), which is more than you need for most manual labor work. That’s strong enough to do everything that the handymen in my building do (none of whom are in very good shape). Look at the top paying blue collar jobs. Virtually none of them require manual labor yet I would bet you that they skew heavily male. Men do have a relative strength advantage so that makes it more efficient, from an allocation of labor perspective, to have them be employed in jobs that require strength. But it does not logically follow that they are therefore uniquely valuable or deserving of higher pay. For instance in India, the average male is 5″ 5″ tall. His relatively small stature means shorter limbs, less ability to use leverage well. Yet they do manual labor there too. The even smaller undernourished men of the Middle Ages did manual labor. That implies that manual labor work is organized to suit the labor power, and if that labor power were female, it would not mean the work would not get done, as you falsely imply. It would just get done differently. Similarly, women in coastal New England towns in the 1800s got by even though their men would be absent 6-8 weeks on fishing trips. That is why the “widow’s watch” is a feature of so many homes, to see if their husband’s ship came back or not. http://career-profiles.careertrends.com/stories/9699/highest-paying-blue-collar-jobs#25-Power-Distributors Reply ↓ Furzy January 23, 2017 at 4:12 am Let me, a woman and a former Wall St. broker, affirm every word of Yves reply…even as a full broker of stocks and futures, I was often referred to as “that girl” by the mucky mucks, NEVER promoted, and several times “let go” before the 5 year vestiture in the firm’s retirement plan….the male brokers got all my accounts, of course….and then, most infuriating, I would hear via the grapevine that my former bosses would declare “Oh, she’ll always find another job, don’t worry about her….” Reply ↓ Dave January 23, 2017 at 5:23 pm Wall Street sounds like a venal, corrupt place. I would not want my son or daughter to work there, nor can I defend, justify or want anything to do with them. Thank you for getting out and educating people as to those rackets through so many means. One more reason for a 1% tax on all speculative activities with a commensurate drop in personal income tax levels. “Feminized professions are always underpaid.” Then why do women join them? There’s a high demand for carpenters, plumbers and journeymen in all the professions. So much so that millions of unskilled immigrants who are not even native speakers of English can come here and do take these jobs. Why don’t American women sign up for them? Pay is approaching $100 an hour for skilled plumbers. Every union seeks females for journey positions. You can make your own hours and take time off for family if you want. You do have to get your hands dirty though. Why is there no link between demands for pay equity and controlling unskilled immigration which through increased labor supply lowers pay for women and men who thus cannot demand higher wages? Thinking further after reading your reply, there are a lot of construction workers who while paid well, do little. I’m thinking CALTRANS, which is a public agency with a union, where five guys often stand around and watch one guy work in the hole. No upper body strength required there, except to hold that beer belly in. Agreei with your last paragraph, my grandmother could out-hoe any guy on the farm. Soviet women worked in factories and on road crews. Of course, they were also cheated of their pay as well as were the men.

It happens all of the time to entirely peaceful protesters of war/wto/pipelines/banksters, etc. It’s rather amazing a Republican President didn’t order violent provacative acts by the police state! O certainly did when it came to peaceful Occupy. Perhaps there is value to be found from so many standing in the streets together aimlessly wondering why they are there and thinking for a moment that a Democrat would fix it…. but at some point these people will have to get specific and challenge TPTB which is entirely corrupt, if they want any sort of justice, equal pay at a living or better wage, fair voting – leading to actual representation by parties or elected politicians themselves. Until that happens your assertions fall flat to experienced protesters. There was no notice to TPTB… it was a bake-less sale without cupcakes or the collection of funds to put towards something specific. It will be forgotten in days. Like instagram… the photos will fade faster than indigestion from fast food. My bet, this felt trendy for many… These were largely comfortable people. The kind of people who think O’romney care is great! That a war on an emotion is fine as long as an idpol Dem gets to wage it. Anyone but Trump (or perhaps Cruz had he beat Her) and they would have stayed home. 90 plus percent will remain Democrats and think they are better because of it.

A significant faction aren’t in line with the “support for sex worker rights” when the term includes pimps and corporatizing brothel-owners. A significant faction of women both straight and gay are also not in line with the idea that there is such a thing as gender identity separate from socialized gender roles or that males who believe themselves female should count as female hires for EEOC, should have their crimes listed as female crimes, should be housed with women prisoners, should compete in female sports or be eligible for women’s scholarships. This is where the term “intersectional” becomes a cudgel, and women who don’t fall in line with this capitalist, neoliberal postmodern primacy-of-subjectivity-over-material-reality politics are being doxxed, no-platformed, and harassed online with rape and death threats. The director of “Boys Don’t Cry” was recently driven off the stage with threats and misogynistic slurs at Reed College by “feminist” activists angry that she hadn’t, in the 90s, hired trans actors for the film. On a national level, those splits can, for a while, be papered over, but on a local level that’s not possible. Reply ↓ cocomaan January 22, 2017 at 12:02 pm I am not cynical about the marches, but I’ll try to defend the people that are: they arise about two years too late. The Democrats threw all their effort into electing HRC. They actually defunded downballot campaigns in order to run a losing election. While the republicans have some rising stars in their middle age (Rubio, Priebus, Cruz come to mind), the democrats have nobody on the bench. It is now a party of geriatrics in freefall. These protests are a good sign and I’m hopeful, but the Democrats are now completely shut out of DC for at least two years. The monumental fuck up has yet to be fully understood, because it’s been a very long time since the D’s were completely out of power. Reply ↓ Carla January 22, 2017 at 1:30 pm Please take a look at the governorships, the state legislatures and congressional gerry-mandering and tell me how the Democrat Party can conceivably return to any measure of power in the next 20 years. The only place they hold any majority is among big-city mayors, and if they’re true to form, they’re very busy figuring out how to hand the cities over to Republicans. A few more private-public partnerships should suffice nicely on that score. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner January 22, 2017 at 4:13 pm For the House, the Dems need 29, so here goes: 8 in California. DWT is all over this. Virginia 2nd, 5th, and 10th Maine 2nd Florida 18th, 25th, 26th, and 27th (DWS pulled resources to protect her Republican friend.) Texas 23rd Michigan 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 11th Illinois 6th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 16th PA 5th,6th, 7th, 8th, 15th, and 16th For those scoring at home, these are more than 30 districts with R+5 or better. They can be won with elbow grease. I didn’t check every state. The Republicans didn’t invent gerrymandering in 2011 with the new census results or start using computers to draw districts then either. As for the Senate, hold serve and pick up Arizona and Nevada which are both attainable. It’s all of a sudden a tie. If the Clintonistas use it as an excuse, it’s simply not true, and imagine if all the marchers took one afternoon to register voters. Gosh, they might have had their girl in the White House. Reply ↓ Vatch January 22, 2017 at 7:25 pm Until the next national election two years from now, the Democrats in the Senate will need to make frequent use of the filibuster. They may have to spend four full years blocking Trump’s choice for the Supreme Court. If they don’t filibuster often, they will fail repeatedly. It’s interesting that you mention Illinois as a state in which the Democrats can win more Congressional districts. One would think that they already have an excess of districts in Illinois, since Illinois is gerrymandered in favor of the Democrats. As far as I know, all of the other heavily gerrymandered states are gerrymandered in favor of the Republicans. Reply ↓ UserFriendly January 23, 2017 at 6:43 am in 2016 there were only 16 house races where the margin was less than 5% (5 won by GOP) and only 33 with a margin less than 10% (15 won by GOP). Thats a big Dem wave you are counting on. The best bet dems have is to storm the Governor’s mansions and state legislatures in 2018 in hopes of stacking the deck in their favor after the Census. Here are the major ones with seats in play: It will be absolutely essential to keep the PA and VA governorships. Controlling redistricting there would net democrats between 4-8 seats. Winning back OH, MI, and WI would probably bring another 4-6. If dems don’t win back the IL and MA governorship they stand to lose at least 3-6 seats. *all estimates include seats likely to be gained/lost to reappointment. ​Of course if the state senate and state house are of the opposite party then it will likely mean the congressional districts come to a compromise. Still though, those are the races to worry about.​ NC’s gerrymander is currently costing D’s 3 seats, unfortunately their governor doesn’t get to veto the maps so the D win there doesn’t help. Same for FL. Long shots that could yield a few seats: IN, GA, TX (yeah, right). NC and IN just happened and the important race will be 2020.

How utterly pointless. And is it any surprise that Trump had a smaller crowd? Most of any inauguration crown is composed of residents of DC and surrounding suburbs. In 2008, 92% of DC residents voted for Obama. In 2016, 4% of DC residents voted for Trump. A smaller inauguration crowd this year was essentially mathematically ordained. But ultimately, who cares? We already knew that Trump was unpopular. Especially in the DC area. The real question is what the hell is Donald Trump going to do as president? The size of the crowd doesn’t tell us a damned thing about that.

Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef January 22, 2017 at 2:14 pm This reminds me of internet polling. Maybe more or fewer people show up, but is it representative of the whole? If nearly half showed up to protest, and the total was smaller than 8 years (whose crowd was all Obama supporters), that is, if 2 x Trump supporters (2017) < Obama supporters (2009), then you really have to wonder if Trump only received less than 1/2 of the vote total that Obama got in 2008.

As many as a million people took part in the main march in Washington, DC. Women gave a host of reasons for marching, ranging from inspiring other women to run for office, to protesting against Trump’s plans to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which among other things requires health insurers to cover birth control. That’s it? To maintain ACA access to birth control? What about better paying full time jobs with benefits? What abut affordable healthcare or ending the constant war mongering that sends their children into combat? How about eduction for their children that doesn’t forced them into their parents basements and life long poverty?

Access to birth control?” I’m going to guess that you are either male or have never had the responsibility of a child if you think birth control and the means to control whether or not you become a parent is a small thing. Prior to reproductive planning the leading cause of mortality in women was childbirth. It still is in areas of the world where there is no effective means to determine whether or not to have a child. But hey, I’d imagine if you have never had your kidneys blocked off due to a fetus or you’ve never had to plan your existence around the existence of another human being then sure, access to reproductive planning is no big deal. If you all want a movement for better paying jobs then I’m sure Fight for $15 would welcome you with open arms. However, I’d change my tactic if you think belittling others for what they care about or feel strongly about is an effective means to convert people or even make them care about what YOU think is important.

Reply ↓ cwaltz January 22, 2017 at 2:49 pm It’s an important issue for women and largely an issue exclusive to women To this date, there has not been a single male who has had gestational diabetes, suffered preeclampsia or died in childbirth. Women get pregnant everyday and in many cases when it happens there are boys(I hesitate to call them men) who walk- nay, run away leaving women holding the bag and dealing with the consequences. So no it shouldn’t be a big surprise that a march by women for women should address pregnancy as an identity issue. My opinion is that social movements should not require you to jettison identity. Who I am and what I experience has value. It shapes and helps inform me on a variety of topics. Intelligent people use information, not throw it away. In keeping with your statement below, women watched the ACA debate. It was then that women were thrown under the bus and Hyde was codified into law and a discussion ensued on what is and isn’t abortion(under Bush birth control was an abortifactent- the equivalent of an abortion. The Supreme Court has upheld that position in not requiring employers to cover the cost of birth control by the way). So yeah the idea I should ASSUME that universal health care would include my reproduction is not upheld by historical facts. With that in mind why in the world would I trust that universal health care would include my incredibly important reproductive rights in it? Why would I assume that people who threw me under the bus before wouldn’t do so again? Reply ↓ RMO January 23, 2017 at 12:31 am As you said, it is a very important issue and it should be one of the main ones raised in the context of the marches. It would have been nice if they had aimed a bit higher (such as pushing for single payer that includes birth control, ready access to abortion services, full care for all aspects of pregnancy and childbirth) and also had a good, solid slate of other issues and policies to fight for but I certainly don’t have a problem with the demand to at least keep the provisions that already exist. Reply ↓ timbers January 22, 2017 at 1:34 pm Better to call for universal healthcare for all. Defending birth control for just 1 sex is a tiny weenie itsy bitsy subset of that and a social identity based defence of a tiny part of healthcare – not a good or smart thing for a world march.

Reply ↓ cwaltz January 22, 2017 at 2:54 pm Yeah that totally worked out for women during the ACA debate. Oh wait it didn’t.

But hey I totally trust you progressives not to screw this up after all since you have Pelosi at the helm again. bahahahahahaha Reply ↓ marym January 22, 2017 at 2:37 pm The impact of women having affordable, reliable access to birth control isn’t itsy bitsy, it’s huge; but ok, agreed that it’s not a sufficient organizing theme for a national march, let alone a national mass movement. However, the statement of one organizer to one media outlet doesn’t reflect yesterday’s events. Even the initial organizing, at least in part a disappointed-Clintonite initiative, had a broader focus on more issues, as well as the general theme of “Women’s rights are human rights.” Then the people who actually participated – in DC, in large US cities, in hundreds of smaller US communities, and in countries and cities around the world – brought in more issues. Not that a random look at tweets is any more representative than a mainstream media interview with a march organizer is any more reliable for analysis of yesterday’s events but: Immigrant rights and solidarity with vulnerable ethnic minorities https://twitter.com/bejohnce/status/822922218002792448 https://twitter.com/DoualyX/status/822875274824085504 EPA, education, anti-war https://twitter.com/KitOConnell/status/822868391207849986 Traditional political power https://twitter.com/jenphalian/status/822873507893743616 Science https://twitter.com/LDMay/status/822922129637330944 etc. IMO, however yesterday got started, and whatever Madonna and Michael Moore think about it (did anyone interview Angela Davis, or someone from the ACLU?), more was revealed about people’s willingness to engage than just a post-election pout and love for the ACA. Maybe that’s too optimistic, but maybe also we build solidarity by showing it, not by withholding it.

Really? I’m sure the Director of National Intelligence will be so happy to know that he doesn’t need to submit anything for funding this year Reply ↓ Yves Smith January 23, 2017 at 9:42 am The statement is substantively accurate.

Frankly I’m frightened to share roads with idiots who use this hyped up technology. It’s all well and good to risk your own life but what about the minivan next to you packed full of little kids? In a plane the risk of collision with another plane is very low. When you’re thousands of feet in the air, engaging the autopilot when you shouldn’t risks mainly yourself. The situation is far different on packed public roads. All driving assistance features need to have their code fully audited by third party watchdogs. Anything else is going to result in more death. We already know from lawsuit testimony that the software development practices of auto companies like Toyota are breathtakingly deficient. Nothing tells me Tesla is any better, in fact since they’re a unicorn company run by a grifter (but I repeat myself…) I’d expect them to be worse.

Satellite and other sensors would feed perfectly gathered data on heat sources, light flashes, radio signatures, stuff like that, into a computer complex, large parts of which were in data-linked but also “autonomous” (because of possible Rooskie Sneakiness) orbiting satellites subject to launch stresses and micrometeorite penetrations and gamma rays and all those energetic particles from the solar wind and so forth, intense cold and heat cycling, human construction. All of that was the real WOPR that these Fokkers were going to give power over the future of humanity and the planet to. I asked one involved engineer I ran into whether he would see a way to do the following: using sensors at intersections, even limiting it to the ones where the most red-light-running collisions occurred, why not install some of the carbon-dioxide lasers that Star Wars was going to orbit at each intersection, firing on a diagonal path across it at tire height, and when a vehicle approached that place and was about to run the red light, why not just slice it off at the hubcaps? something like 5,000 people die in intersection accidents every year. Rather than clean up and charge criminally and collect fines after the fact, how about a little REAL deterrence? Produced a lot of hemming and hawing about mil-specs and how the accidental Armageddon could not POSSIBLY happen via some sort of technical glitch or failure… Good enough for planetary commitments to destruction, but not to deal with a fairly simple problem with real consequences.

Long ago, in the seminal year of 1968 the writer and Marxist John Berger composed a short essay on The Nature of Mass Demonstrations, in an era where street protests and demos seemingly had real effects on national policies throughout the Western world. He distinguished very clearly between those demonstrations that were mere public spectacle – harmless, essentially, and indulged by the State because no real threat to its legitimacy was intended – and those that were – as Berger saw it – “revolutionary rehearsals”, whose intent was clearly to upset the prevailing order, and to be met with State violence. All would agree that since the 60s, mass protests against government policies, whether domestic or foreign – e.g., military actions – have largely been street theatre, ignored by “the authorities”, or countered by ritual projection of State power by the use of punitive police actions or outright violence against marchers or speakers. Isolated but persistent demonstrations of a purely local action but with national implications such as Ferguson, or that of the DAPL action are exceptions because of the unique circumstances or catalyzing events that precipitated the demos initially, and never really moved beyond the immediate geographical confines of the confrontations with governmental authority. Berger’s essay is well worth considering in its totality, especially as it concerns the assumption of requisite ideological foundations and dedication to – as he would have it – “revolutionary awareness”, or perhaps “consciousness raising” as a more contemporary phraseology. Timely, despite being nearly 50 yrs. since written. John Berger The Nature of Mass Demonstrations Seventy years ago (on 6 May 1898) there was a massive demonstration of workers, men and women, in the centre of Milan. The events which led up to it involve too long a history to treat with here. The demonstration was attacked and broken up by the army under the command of General Beccaris. At noon the cavalry charged the crowd: the unarmed workers tried to make barricades: martial law was declared and for three days the army fought against the unarmed. The official casualty figures were 100 workers killed and 450 wounded. One policeman was killed accidentally by a soldier. There were no army casualties. (Two years later Umberto I was assassinated because after the massacre he publicly congratulated General Beccaris, the ‘butcher of Milan.’) I have been trying to understand certain aspects of the demonstration in the Corso Venezia on 6 May because of a story I am writing. In the process I came to a few conclusions about demonstrations which may perhaps be more widely applicable. Mass demonstrations should be distinguished from riots or revolutionary uprisings although, under certain (now rare) circumstances, they may develop into either of the latter. The aims of a riot are usually immediate (the immediacy matching the desperation they express): the seizing of food, the release of prisoners, the destruction of property. The aims of a revolutionary uprising are long-term and comprehensive: they culminate in the taking over of State power. The aims of a demonstration, however, are symbolic: it demonstrates a force that is scarcely used. A large number of people assemble together in an obvious and already announced public place. They are more or less unarmed. (On 6 May 1898, entirely unarmed.) They present themselves as a target to the forces of repression serving the State authority against whose policies they are protesting. Theoretically demonstrations are meant to reveal the strength of popular opinion or feeling: theoretically they are an appeal to the democratic conscience of the State. But this presupposes a conscience which is very unlikely to exist. If the State authority is open to democratic influence, the demonstration will hardly be necessary; if it is not, it is unlikely to be influenced by an empty show of force containing no real threat. (A demonstration in support of an already established alternative State authority – as when Garibaldi entered Naples in 1860 – is a special case and may be immediately effective.) Demonstrations took place before the principle of democracy was even nominally admitted. The massive early Chartist demonstrations were part of the struggle to obtain such an admission. The crowds who gathered to present their petition to the Tsar in St Petersburg in 1905 were appealing – and presenting themselves as a target – to the ruthless power of an absolute monarchy. In the event – as on so many hundreds of other occasions all over Europe – they were shot down. It would seem that the true function of demonstrations is not to convince the existing State authority to any significant degree. Such an aim is only a convenient rationalisation. The truth is that mass demonstrations are rehearsals for revolution: not strategic or even tactical ones, but rehearsals of revolutionary awareness. The delay between the rehearsals and the real performance may be very long: their quality – the intensity of rehearsed awareness – may, on different occasions, vary considerably: but any demonstration which lacks this element of rehearsal is better described as an officially encouraged public spectacle. A demonstration, however much spontaneity it may contain, is a created event which arbitrarily separates itself from ordinary life. Its value is the result of its artificiality, for therein lies its prophetic, rehearsing possibilities. A mass demonstration distinguishes itself from other mass crowds because it congregates in public to create its function, instead of forming in response to one: in this, it differs from any assembly of workers within their place of work – even when strike action is involved – or from any crowd of spectators. It is an assembly which challenges what is given by the mere fact of its coming together. State authorities usually lie about the number of demonstrators involved. The lie, however, makes little difference. (It would only make a significant difference if demonstrations really were an appeal to the democratic conscience of the State.) The importance of the numbers involved is to be found in the direct experience of those taking part in or sympathetically witnessing the demonstration. For them the numbers cease to be numbers and become the evidence of their senses, the conclusions of their imagination. The larger the demonstration, the more powerful and immediate (visible, audible, tangible) a metaphor it becomes for their total collective strength. I say metaphor because the strength thus grasped transcends the potential strength of those present, and certainly their actual strength as deployed in a demonstration. The more people there are there, the more forcibly they represent to each other and to themselves those who are absent. In this way a mass demonstration simultaneously extends and gives body to an abstraction. Those who take part become more positively aware of how they belong to a class. Belonging to that class ceases to imply a common fate, and implies a common opportunity. They begin to recognise that the function of their class need no longer be limited: that it, too, like the demonstrations itself, can create its own function. Revolutionary awareness is rehearsed in another way by the choice and effect of location. Demonstrations are essentially urban in character, and they are usually planned to take place as near as possible to some symbolic centre, either civic or national. Their ‘targets’ are seldom the strategic ones – railway stations, barracks, radio stations, airports. A mass demonstration can be interpreted as the symbolic capturing of a city or capital. Again, the symbolism or metaphor is for the benefit of the participants. The demonstration, an irregular event created by the demonstrators, nevertheless takes place near the city centre, intended for very different uses. The demonstrators interrupt the regular life of the streets they march through or of the open spaces they fill. They ‘cut off these areas, and, not yet having the power to occupy them permanently, they transform them into a temporary stage on which they dramatise the power they still lack. The demonstrators’ view of the city surrounding their stage also changes. By demonstrating, they manifest a greater freedom and independence – a greater creativity, even although the product is only symbolic – than they can ever achieve individually or collectively when pursuing their regular lives. In their regular pursuits they only modify circumstances; by demonstrating they symbolically oppose their very existence to circumstances. This creativity may be desperate in origin, and the price to be paid for it high, but it temporarily changes their outlook. They become corporately aware that it is they or those whom they represent who have built the city and who maintain it. They see it through different eyes. They see it as their product, confirming their potential instead of reducing it. Finally, there is another way in which revolutionary awareness is rehearsed. The demonstrators present themselves as a target to the so-called forces of law and order. Yet the larger the target they present, the stronger they feel. This cannot be explained by the banal principle of ‘strength in numbers,’ any more than by vulgar theories of crowd psychology. The contradiction between their actual vulnerability and their sense of invincibility corresponds to the dilemma which they force upon the State authority. Either authority must abdicate and allow the crowd to do as it wishes: in which case the symbolic suddenly becomes real, and, even if the crowd’s lack of organisation and preparedness prevents it from consolidating its victory, the event demonstrates the weakness of authority. Or else authority must constrain and disperse the crowd with violence: in which case the undemocratic character of such authority is publicly displayed. The imposed dilemma is between displayed weakness and displayed authoritarianism. (The officially approved and controlled demonstration does not impose the same dilemma: its symbolism is censored: which is why I term it a mere public spectacle.) Almost invariably, authority chooses to use force. The extent of its violence depends upon many factors, but scarcely ever upon the scale of the physical threat offered by the demonstrators. This threat is essentially symbolic. But by attacking the demonstration authority ensures that the symbolic event becomes an historical one: an event to be remembered, to be learnt from, to be avenged. It is in the nature of a demonstration to provoke violence upon itself. Its provocation may also be violent. But in the end it is bound to suffer more than it inflicts. This is a tactical truth and an historical one. The historical role of demonstrations is to show the injustice, cruelty, irrationality of the existing State authority. Demonstrations are protests of innocence. But the innocence is of two kinds, which can only be treated as though they were one at a symbolic level. For the purposes of political analysis and the planning of revolutionary action, they must be separated. There is an innocence to be defended and an innocence which must finally be lost: an innocence which derives from justice, and an innocence which is the consequence of a lack of experience. Demonstrations express political ambitions before the political means necessary to realise them have been created. Demonstrations predict the realisation of their own ambitions and thus may contribute to that realisation, but they cannot themselves achieve them. The question which revolutionaries must decide in any given historical situation is whether or not further symbolic rehearsals are necessary. The next stage is training in tactics and strategy for the performance itself. Sorry for taking up much space.

There have been 16 attacks since last March on ships in the Sulu and Celebes Seas, through which about $40 billion worth of cargo passes each year, according to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP).

Reply ↓ Buttinsky January 22, 2017 at 3:39 pm Thanks for posting the link to “CORRUPTION IMPROVES REELECTION CHANCES / HOW MUCH CAN POLITICIANS STEAL BEFORE GETTING PUNISHED?” It’s nice to see that someone has gone to the trouble of writing a detailed paper on what would seem self-evident — crime pays. That’s why politicians and other criminals engage in it. And as usual, the longer/deeper one is in the game, the higher one’s chance of getting caught. Which can be a bummer. I especially like the understated way the author makes the point that furthering an electoral career is at odds with building a better society. “Political corruption can be the source of much economic ineﬃciency and is arguably one of the main problems constraining developing economies in their growth and prosperity. However can corruption be used to improve re-election chances of politicians in oﬃce? And what is the optimal level of corruption for doing so? This paper uses fraudulent public procurement in local government as a unique proxy for corruption and ties it to re-election probabilities of local government oﬃcials. It ﬁnds that due to a relationship between local quasi-entrepreneurs and political elites, local politicians can win elections without constraining their corrupt activities. The paper ﬁnds an optimal level of corruption for which politicians maximize their re-election chances.” Reply ↓ ewmayer January 22, 2017 at 3:54 pm Ha, ha, the woman sitting at the table a few feet away at my local coffee joint is reading The Road To Character by David Brooks, which the Amazon blurb-o-matic describes in suitably hagiographical terms thusly: With the wisdom, humor, curiosity, and sharp insights that have brought millions of readers to his New York Times column and his previous bestsellers, David Brooks has consistently illuminated our daily lives in surprising and original ways. In The Social Animal, he explored the neuroscience of human connection and how we can flourish together. Now, in The Road to Character, he focuses on the deeper values that should inform our lives. Responding to what he calls the culture of the Big Me, which emphasizes external success, Brooks challenges us, and himself, to rebalance the scales between our “résumé virtues”—achieving wealth, fame, and status—and our “eulogy virtues,” those that exist at the core of our being: kindness, bravery, honesty, or faithfulness, focusing on what kind of relationships we have formed. Looking to some of the world’s greatest thinkers and inspiring leaders, Brooks explores how, through internal struggle and a sense of their own limitations, they have built a strong inner character. Labor activist Frances Perkins understood the need to suppress parts of herself so that she could be an instrument in a larger cause. Dwight Eisenhower organized his life not around impulsive self-expression but considered self-restraint. Dorothy Day, a devout Catholic convert and champion of the poor, learned as a young woman the vocabulary of simplicity and surrender. Civil rights pioneers A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin learned reticence and the logic of self-discipline, the need to distrust oneself even while waging a noble crusade. Blending psychology, politics, spirituality, and confessional, The Road to Character provides an opportunity for us to rethink our priorities, and strive to build rich inner lives marked by humility and moral depth. “Joy,” David Brooks writes, “is a byproduct experienced by people who are aiming for something else. But it comes.” (Snif) It’s just so inspiring! I shall have to dive in, just as soon as I finish Michael J. Gelb’s self-improvement classic How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci: Seven Steps to Genius Every Day. Hey, if Leonardo could do it, yes we can! Reply ↓ HotFlash January 22, 2017 at 5:29 pm Lessee — Frances Perkins, Dwight Eisenhower, Dorothy Day, A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin. All dead.

Reply ↓ Eclair January 23, 2017 at 2:18 pm Dorothy Day, “devout Catholic convert.” Well, she was a ‘convert.’ But ‘devout’ in the groveling to power, David Brooks brand of devout? I don’t think so. Until her recent rehabilitation by Pope Francis, she was a Church outsider. Mostly because she actually believed in following the path of Jesus; be poor, live with the poor, ask why poverty still exists, be a gad-fly to the Establishment. No charity balls to raise money.

From 2012, an interesting report. A pilot of British extraction was flying an unpowered sailplane on a recreational flight in SCar. He ran short of thermal lift, which is how these planes gain altitude in flight. The whole plane weighs maybe 600 pounds with pilot aboard. It flies at a max of maybe 120 mph. But the exigencies of his day took him near a nuclear power plant, leading to his being ordered to land, arrested by a small army of 17 cop cars looking for action, some suggesting he should be shot down, held for over 24 hours, charged with”breach of peace,” a charge later dropped in exchange for his agreement not to sue the government. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s9FXuP4S9p8 Note that FAA maps (“sectionals”) apparently do not show any “no fly zones,” though NOTAMs (notices to airmen) may have noted the plant site as to be avoided. I did not check. One thing to note, the guy was a member of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. Membership includes representation by lawyers in such contacts. Lots of fokkin politicians also belong. AOPA lobbies actively from DC hq. One model for “resistance–” — not sure what kind of association the residents of Ferguson, MO or Flint or Chicago might be able to join to get the same deal, for $99 a year… Again, this was 2012. I’m sure everything has since gotten better, so one can once again soar “O’er the Laaand of the Freeee, and the Home of the Braaaave…” Reply ↓ RMO January 23, 2017 at 12:48 am There were no NOTAMS restricting flight where he was nor were there any permanent restrictions. The police had no valid reason to demand any action of him or to arrest him. I’m a glider pilot myself (though I fly mostly here at home in Canada) so I’m quite familiar with this case. Even the relatively privileged of us (white, financially well off enough to afford to fly for fun and with the ability to secure a good legal defense) can get thrown in the hole for no damned good reason – it makes me realize just how terrifying an encounter with the police is if, for example, you were black or poor (or black AND poor). Reply ↓ JTMcPhee January 23, 2017 at 11:23 am “Might Makes Right.” “Without a remedy, there is no right.” At least some people have a tiny chink through which they can band together and fund a ‘defense fund’ and the lobbyists concentrating on this small part of “Our Democracy” to limit in tiny instances the horror and impact of the crushing paw of “the government.” Have the police forces in Canada been playing catch-up with the Security State that we Americans suffer from? I see Trudeau as predicted is “doing an Obama.” Too bad Rob Ford died so young — maybe he could have been the Canadian Trump… Reply ↓ RMO January 24, 2017 at 1:45 am “Have the police forces in Canada been playing catch-up with the Security State that we Americans suffer from?” To a certain extent yes but things aren’t as bad. Which, come to think of it applies to a lot of things you can compare and contrast between Canada and the U.S. :-) So far my only aviation related encounter with the RCMP involved the time I dropped off one of the gliding club’s gliders (in its road transport trailer) at our little grass airport after it had been to another airport for maintenance. As I was putting the trailer away a Citabria (a two seat light aeroplane) perform what looked like a “stop-and-go” landing. When I went to leave a police car puled up in front of me and the officer asked me what I was doing there and after telling him I was a member of the gliding club he demanded identification and proof of that. He took it to his car and got on the radio. About thirty minutes later he came out, gave me back my pilot’s license, driver’s license, club membership card and said I could go. When I asked him what this was all about he just turned away and left. Seemed a little rude. Later that week I found out that the Citabria had flown up from the U.S. and was suspected of being used for smuggling. Everywhere the plane went the police were waiting. Eventually the pilot set it down on a road when he was out of fuel, bent the wings and got arrested. Strangely enough the guy who bought the wreck and rebuilt it was someone I went to high school with and who was working as an apprentice aircraft mechanic at the shop I get my glider maintained at. Recently a newer club member who I gave flight instruction to bought the plane from him. It seems to want to stay near me or something.

He’s never been money or power motivated, so the “sellout” charge is ludicrous. In fact, the sort of behavior you observe is EXACTLY like what Richard Kline described in “Progressively Losing.” Progressives are interested in being morally correct and winning arguments, and not in exercising power. http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/09/richard-kline-progressively-losing.html So you could argue that the sort of nihilism you observe is just like what the Dems do, virtue signaling.

But to get the most out of it, you'll want to dig into the Alexa app settings so you can customize what it does — and what it doesn't do. For example, did you know you could have Alec Baldwin wake you? To access Alexa settings, open the free iOS or Android Alexa app, or log in with your Amazon account information to the web interface at alexa.amazon.com. Select Settings in the menu. You'll see a list of all of your devices that offer Alexa; some settings are specific to a device, while others apply to all of your devices that use Alexa. MORE: Amazon Alexa Guide: Tips, Tricks and How-Tos Change a device name Picture 2 of 13 By default, a device is set up with your first name and the product name, such as Michael's Echo or Michael's Fire TV. You can change it to whatever you'd like — if you have multiple Echos, you can name each by the room it's in, for example. This will help you when managing device-specific settings. MORE: 19 Alexa Tricks and Easter Eggs Your Family Will Love Set your address Picture 3 of 13 Many Alexa services, such as weather and traffic, depend on knowing your location. If you bought your Alexa-equipped device from Amazon, it likely has your ZIP code already entered. But you can set your street address for even more focused local information. You do this through each device's location setting. MORE: The Best IFTTT Applets for Amazon Alexa Change the wake word Picture 4 of 13 If you have an Echo and you don't like the name Alexa, or you have someone else in the house with that name, you can choose Amazon or Echo as the wake word. This doesn't apply to the Fire tablet or TV, though, because you wake Alexa with the home button or through the remote.  Change and customize sounds Picture 5 of 13 I found my Echo's alarm to be too quiet on the default setting. But there's a way to fix that: To change the default volume for alarms, timers and notifications, go to the Sounds & Notifications setting. You can also pick the sound for an alarm, or use a Celebrity sound, such as Missy Elliott shouting "Wake up!" or Alec Baldwin saying "Wake up, sunshine." You can also set Alexa to make a sound when it is listening and another sound when it is done with a command, which is particularly useful if you have an Echo placed in a location where you can't always see the LED ring around the top. Safeguard your voice purchases Picture 6 of 13 It's convenient to order products through Alexa, but that can lead to some unexpected purchases. Just imagine your child saying, "Alexa, order me a dollhouse," or a news broadcaster repeating that phrase on air. This is easy to prevent: Create a passcode you'll use to confirm any voice purchases. You can set that up in the Voice Purchases setting. Here, you can also turn off voice purchasing completely, too. Delete your history Picture 7 of 13 Alexa records every interaction you have with it. If you're concerned about privacy, you can delete single interactions by going into History. Select the recording; then tap "Delete voice recordings." However, if you want to delete all recordings, you have to go through your Amazon account online. Go to Manage Your Content and Devices; then select Devices. Click Actions, and select "Manage your recordings." This will allow you to delete all recordings at once. MORE: How to Delete Recordings from Your Alexa History Set Household Profiles Picture 8 of 13 One of Alexa's advantages over Google Assistant is its ability to switch users. But to switch profiles in Alexa, the other person must be a part of your Amazon Household. To add a person to your household, go to Household Profiles to start the process. The person you want to add will need to be with you to follow prompts to join your household.

To change the music source, go to Account, and select Music & Media. You can even choose different defaults for stations and your music library. It's easy to temporarily bypass your default service, too: If Spotify is set as default, say, "Alexa, play Bob Dylan on Amazon Music," to use that library instead.

India-based engineering firm Tata Elxsi announced today that it’s gearing up to begin testing its own self-driving system in the southern Indian city of Bangalore. Although it isn’t building its own cars, the company (which is part of the Tata Group that also runs power, steel, communications and software businesses and racked up revenues crossing $100 billion in 2015-16) told Business Standard that it’s already started trials with two sedans at a facility on the edge of town with its custom kit consisting of LIDAR and radar, as well as cameras and sensors that feed data to a centralized processing stack. “The most awesome stage” Last year, Facebook's VP of Design thought the TNW Conference main stage was the best she'd ever been on. FIND OUT WHY If it secures the necessary permits in Bangalore, Tata Elxsi will be the first company to test self-driving tech on Indian roads. It hopes to eventually be able to offer manufacturers a platform that’s ready to be integrated into their vehicles in the years to come. The challenge that Indian roads and traffic conditions offer is vastly different from what the likes of Google and Tesla are up against in developed countries. In India, lane discipline and pedestrian movement are wildly erratic, and the large numbers of two-wheelers and three-wheeler rickshaws that zig-zag between larger vehicles will likely provide autonomous vehicles’ sensors with far more data than they might pick up on roads in North America and Europe. However, there’s a strong case for bringing self-driving cars to India. The country recorded a whopping 400 fatal road accidents per day in 2015; that’s one death every 3.6 minutes. Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Road Transport and Highways, has a lofty goal of reducing that figure by half by 2020. With intelligent technology behind the wheel, that might be possible over time. Traffic congestion and air pollution caused by vehicular emissions are both on the rise. Last September, the World Health Organization reported that the capital of New Delhi was the second most polluted city in the world, thanks to high fine-particulate-matter (PM2.5) levels that were nearly 11 times higher than what the agency’s health standards prescribe. With more self-driving cars and efficient carpooling systems for commutes, the number of vehicles could be reduced significantly. For reference, an MIT study noted earlier this month that the number of cabs in New York City could be brought down from 13,000 to 3,000 if more people carpooled. Experts believe that self-driving cars will only begin to become commonplace around 2025, but it’s likely that demand for those vehicles will mostly be concentrated within developed countries. Efforts like Tata Elxsi’s could see the tech arrive at least around a similar time frame in emerging markets like India. I for one, can’t wait to not have to drive a car ever again.

BUSINESS Technology Spectacles might get the buzz, but for investors Snapchat is all about the advertising Snapchat Spectacles Al Seib / Los Angeles Times Los Angeles resident Albert Borrero tries his pair of Spectacles shortly after they went on sale in November. Los Angeles resident Albert Borrero tries his pair of Spectacles shortly after they went on sale in November. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Paresh DaveContact Reporter The company behind Snapchat has two offerings — that beloved, 5-year-old app for messaging and video streaming, and Spectacles, a months-old, $130 pair of sunglasses that double as a camcorder. The Los Angeles company has promised more gadgets will follow. But even with a significant increase, hardware sales in the near term probably would bring in 100 times less revenue than selling ads displayed on Snapchat. It’s that potentially massive, multibillion-dollar ad business that has investors most excited about Snap Inc., which is expected to open its stock to public trading in the coming weeks in one of the tech industry’s highest-anticipated initial public offerings in years. So why is Snap insisting it’s actually a camera company? The label introduced last year raised questions about Snap’s hardware ambitions. But more than signaling that Snap is the next Apple Inc. — a firm that makes software and hardware but derives about two-thirds of its revenue from iPhone sales — the distinction could be an attempt to help investors see the nuance between the goals of Snapchat and those of its most potent rival, Facebook. Unlike Facebook, Snap’s not out to connect everyone on the planet. Rather, its goal is to tinker with both the physical make of cameras and the code behind them, giving people new ways to chat with friends, have fun together and educate themselves about the world. Both companies rely on advertising revenue, but Snap, which declined to comment, appears to be suggesting its approach will be more focused. “They need to show they are not just Facebook for teens,” said Gene Munster, who studied Apple’s finances for years and now co-manages investment firm Loup Ventures. Tech companies that enjoy the most sustained success have visions beyond what’s visible to most today, and Snap is arranging itself to join that group. “Twenty years from now, the way we engage with the world will probably not be a phone," Munster said. “Hardware changes are going to be happening, and this mission gives them a foothold and foundation to be prepared for this transition.” Though the camera, both in apps and in gadgets, will be central to that aim, investors and the financial analysts who advise them ascribe minimal value to Spectacles and other hardware. They insist Snap’s real value is in the advertising business. If Snap wishes otherwise, it will have a long way to go before changing perceptions. “I would be hard-pressed to imagine them as a hardware company unless it's possible to see a long-term commitment to that business,” said Brian Wieser, who follows companies such as Facebook for Pivotal Research. “So for now, it’s an ad tech company.” Still, Snap joins financial technology company Square Inc. as one of the first Internet companies with revenue coming from both hardware and software at the time of an initial public stock offering. That split helps diversify its business, but it means Snap also will have to justify to investors any hardware-related expenses. Snap has shared limited financial data with potential investors and met only with a select group of analysts. More could become clear when it publicly shares its stock prospectus, which could be as early as this week. Experimentation doesn’t necessarily hurt share prices, said Scott Kessler, a financial analyst at CFRA. Amazon.com, Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet Inc. have gotten away with unrealized product goals as their core businesses continue to surge. “People want to see these companies innovating and trying new things,” Kessler said. But troubles can arise. For one, hardware can reduce earnings. “Software is the way to go because that’s a more profitable business,” Kessler said. “Manufacturing things, that’s obviously more challenging from supply chain, cost perspective. It’s a lot different than someone going somewhere and downloading software.” Still, companies often try to show investors before they go public that they are more than one-trick businesses. Ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc. has ventured into self-driving delivery trucks. Short-term rental booking giant Airbnb is trying to help consumers with more aspects of travel planning. Both could go public this year or next. But companies new to public markets must live up to those promises or risk seeing their value fall.  The faltering shares of GoPro, which closed a much-heralded video-distribution business two years after an IPO, and Twitter, which couldn’t maintain user growth, reflects what happens when reality doesn’t meet expectations. For Square’s part, hardware has grown slightly as a portion of its revenue mix. If anything, fear that many tech start-ups such as Snap are overvalued has led to more skepticism about second acts in the last year. Chinese phone maker and social media app developer Meitu has seen its shares barely budge from their initial price since going public a month ago. About 95% of Meitu’s revenue comes from phone sales, and analysts question how fast the software business can grow. Snap has used a vending machine to distribute its $130 video-camera sunglasses. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times Snap has used a vending machine to distribute its $130 video-camera sunglasses. Snap has used a vending machine to distribute its $130 video-camera sunglasses. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) In Snap’s favor is that its second revenue line already has inklings of success. Spectacles have received positive reviews. Investors point to the long lines that Snap generated by selling the sunglasses through roving vending machines. It’s a wacky experience that has energized the industry. And because of Snap’s generally small release of thousands of pairs, investors simply are discounting the idea for now. “It seems like a noble experiment akin to Google Glass, but not yet a central part of the Snap value proposition,” said Chris Rust, a founder at Clear Ventures who held a board observer role at GoPro. Instead, Snap’s biggest challenge could be convincing investors to notice the distinctions with Facebook and showing them that profit is within sight. Alexander Stimpson, co-chief investment officer at Newport Beach money manager Corient Capital Partners, said he’s worried that companies going public before demonstrating recurring profitability have turned investors into speculators. It forces them to invest based on instincts rather than formulas. And despite the great risks, they stand to gain a much smaller return than the venture capitalists who held shares prior to the IPO. “If a company is unprofitable, the rewards should be substantial because you’re taking substantial risk,” he said. Because Snap isn’t yet profitable, Stimpson doesn’t mind coming late to the party when it may be a safer bet. “When there’s no earnings there, it forces investors to behave in a way that’s against their best interests to be successful long term,” he said. “Investors are successful when they are disciplined about valuations, when profits matter, when metrics matter, when they buy low and sell high.” Still, many analysts expect the excitement to be so great that Snap gets whatever price it wants. Hitting the stock market could bring Snap’s value upward of $25 billion. “Any time you have a brand-name company, you’re going to have a lot of interest,” said Ivan Feinseth, director of research at Tigress Financial Partners. “They are very strong in the teen, preteen and the millennial market. They’re a key player.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss So-called sanctuary cities were once places of refuge. A surge in media mergers is expected under Trump’s pro-business agenda. Chinese New Year begins tomorrow. Grocery store tomatoes are often tasteless but researchers at the University of Florida have discovered a game-changer.

Much is at stake for the South Korean manufacturer after it suffered a whopping $5 billion dollar loss following its global recall of the Note 7 last year. The Galaxy S8 is expected to boast the latest in smartphone technology and feature major design innovations. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 may feature bezel-less display The yet-to-be-released device has been in the news of-late. Fortunately, this has given us an idea of what to expect from the phone. Here is a recap of all the Galaxy S8 rumours that have surfaced to date. Edge to edge bezel-less display Samsung’s latest flagship is expected to feature a full screen bezel-less display and no physical home button. The rumour hints at a revolutionary design allowing for a greater viewing area while maintaining overall size. The physical home button could be replaced with a virtual one. We are not too sure about how the finger print reader will be incorporated in such a design though. AI Assistant Apple and Google are the only smartphone manufacturers that offer products which feature smart assistants. This is expected to be a thing of the past with the introduction of the S8. Samsung made an official announcement on the inclusion of an AI assistant in the upcoming smartphone after its acquisition of Viv Labs Inc, a firm run by a Siri voice assistant programme co-creator. 4K Display Samsung has been a leader when it comes to smartphone displays. The manufacturer already offers a dual curved display with Quad HD resolution. However, word has it that the tech giant may switch to a higher 4K display with the S8. While the higher resolution will certainly make for a better user experience, it would also consume greater power. This points towards a larger battery as well. Here are 7 worth waiting ‘features’ of Samsung Galaxy S8 Aditionally, the S8 is rumoured to feature two screen sizes with curved displays. Therefore, we could see Samsung replacing the Edge badge with a PRO version possibly. Major Hardware Upgrades Samsung’s flagship devices arguably feature the best in hardware and it would be safe to expect the S8 to pack Qualcomm’s most advance Snapdragon 835 processor. Another rumour suggests the new phone will feature two rear cameras like Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. Release Date Traditionally, Samsung has unveiled its flagship mobile devices at the annual Mobile World Congress. The congress is slated to take place next month. However, it has been suggested that the company may ditch the event to hold its own “Unpacked” event in April.

 This trader is helping Europeans working in the UK leave after the Brexit vote Oscar Williams-Grut Jan. 22, 2017, 5:02 AM 3,001 facebook linkedin twitter email print Expat Exit founder Marcin Czyza. Marcin Czyza LONDON — The prospect of companies axing thousands of jobs in the UK has haunted the national psyche following Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year. Concrete moves have been few and far between despite many companies, particular in the financial sector, talking seriously about moving jobs out of Britain. But outside of the boardrooms, a smaller grassroots exodus has begun. Expats who came to Britain to further their careers are reconsidering their future. "I’m not saying [Brexit] was the only reason, because we did have prior reasons, although I did think it did play quite a big role," Natalia Briedis, a Pole working as a change analyst at a Norwich financial services firm, told BI. Briedis is one of hundreds of people who have registered with Expat Exit, a new project that aims to help foreigners working in the UK find new jobs in other countries in the wake of the Brexit vote. The project is the brainchild of Marcin Czyza, a Polish commodities trader working in Amsterdam. "My colleagues from the UK said they would be searching for new jobs now and I thought it would be a great idea to create some kind of organisation that I could turn into a business," Czyza told BI, who has not worked or lived in the UK himself. "At the beginning, of course, I struggled to promote the website. Then somehow Google recognised me and I started to have more and more registrations, almost everyday. I run this project as a non-profit organisation at the moment but I’d like to transform it to a recruitment business soon." Natalie Briedis, who registered with Expat Exit. Natalie Briedis Czyza says he has had close to 1,000 people register on the site since the middle of last year when he launched it and has seen spikes in interest corresponding with the government's "Hard Brexit" rhetoric. This week, for example, his site saw four times as many registrations as usual in the wake of Theresa May's speech announcing Britain would leave the single market. "I talked to many people who registered on my website and in many cases they told me the same — Brexit was just a cherry on the cake," Czyza says. "They were already thinking about it for other reasons, whether furthering their career or the experience, sometimes not feeling welcomed in the UK — many reasons, you name it. Then the voting happened and many people felt they were not welcome anymore. Many people are just saying Brexit was a kick for them to search for another job." People who register on the Expat Exit website say where they would like to go and what type of job they would like. Financial services workers are by far the most common profession looking to relocate and Czyza says their destinations of choice are most often Frankfurt, Paris, Singapore, Hong Kong. But he adds: "In some cases people are just writing: somewhere where it’s hot, somewhere where I can swim. In these cases it’s quite hard to give a statistic." Despite the name, Expat Exit is not just for expats living in the UK. Harry Waterer is a 26-year-old Brit who worked in the City and broader financial services before turning to Marcin to help him relocate to Amsterdam. "I started hearing this word Brexit and thought this is a little bit worrying, what options have I got?" Waterer told BI. "Am I best to stay here and look for options here or am I best to go somewhere else? I looked at options in Dubai, in Singapore." Both Waterer and Briedis connected with Czyza over Facebook and Waterer, who moved to Amsterdam in August of last year, describes himself as a "guinea pig" for Czyza's project. "He was great," Waterer says. "He talked to me about taxation over here and the relief of going on your own. We’ve become quite close friends over it, which is great. We see each other quite a lot." Brit Harry Waterer also turned to Marcin Czyza for help relocating. Harry Waterer. For now, Czyza is using his own contacts to help people find jobs on the continent but he hopes to turn the project into a proper recruitment business. He says: "There are many companies already interested in my project now. Most importantly, I bring them valuable people. Firstly, they’re available now. Secondly, they have experience from London or the UK which is always good. Right now I’m having conversations with a leading Polish bank because they’re interested in Polish professionals who want to leave London." Czyza thinks his idea has big potential: "My personal opinion is the British economy will suffer. The sooner you decide to get out, the better it will be. Worst case scenario, London will lose its position as a world-leading financial centre." Waterer agrees, saying: "I think there’s a lot of volatility within the community, especially within London. People are moving to Frankfurt or they’re moving to Amsterdam because they see this as a sustainable place and secure within the eurozone. "Post-Brexit, even now, nobody actually knows what is going to happen when we actually leave. We’re stuck in this very, very grey area." Briedis says: "I keep hearing about people losing their jobs, especially in financial service industry. I just didn’t want to leave my career to chance. If I’m going to leave I’m going to leave on my own terms." She adds: "I wouldn’t be coming to Britain now because I don’t know what the future would bring for the expats in one or two years time. I wouldn’t want to come to a country where I might be forced to leave or my terms of staying here could be altered in one or two years time."

[PHoto: dolphfyn/iStock] More from Hit The Ground Running The Fastest Way To Turn Around Career Burnout What You Should Do After Getting Fired How To Avoid Being Professionally Ghosted Six Tips For Improving Your Digital Job Search While You're Unemployed Tina Arnoldi 01.22.17 5:00 AM When’s the last time you Googled yourself? If you said never, it’s time to start. Recruiters and potential employers are already searching you to decide if you’re a candidate worth pursuing. And if they aren’t searching you by name because they don’t know who you are (yet), then you've got a head start. Now's the time—not when you send in your resume or get called in to interview—to make sure you come up for keywords related to your personal brand. And yes, everyone has a brand—it's your reputation in the job market and what you're known for. The good news is that you get to define it. Once you decide how you want to position yourself, the next step is to optimize your brand content across your online channels so it's easily found by search. Here's exactly what to do. Flesh Out Your LinkedIn Profile Lots of people have LinkedIn accounts, but few of them are as polished or robust as they can be for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes. For starters, replace that picture of you and your dog. It’s cute but not the right type of photo for a professional network. It might be right for another platform, but you'll probably want to use a more professional headshot for a solid first impression on LinkedIn. Never leave the summary field blank. Max it out to the 2,000-character limit. Next, edit your headline (here's how if you need instructions). It defaults to your current job title, but you can modify it—and you should. Use keywords related to your current skills and what you want to be doing with them in the future. Stay away from trendy headlines like "chief happiness officer," even if that's your actual job title. Creative job titles are a lot more common now, and they do indicate a customer support or human resources role. But a recruiter is more likely to search "customer support" or "human resources" than "happiness" when looking for candidates. Never leave the summary field blank. Max it out to the 2,000-character limit. This is where you highlight your accomplishments rather than your formal job description. Recruiters want to see what you’ve done so they can decide if you’re a good fit for their client. Claim the vanity URL that has your name so it looks like "linkedin.com/in/yourname" (here's how to do that). Since LinkedIn often ranks well in organic search, including your name directly in the URL can also help you rank well. Once you've finished giving your LinkedIn a spit-shine, you can add that URL to the bio of your other social media profiles. Include other places where people can find you online by customizing the website listings in your contact information. Rather than using LinkedIn’s default of "website," select "other" when you add links to your profile so you can label them with a specific company name or note it’s a writing portfolio, for instance. That can help it stand out when someone views the contact info on your profile. Your final step in optimizing LinkedIn is deciding how much of your profile you want to make available to the general public. Your public profile can be modified so you limit what people see when they aren't logged into LinkedIn. There are some upsides to doing that; requiring people to log in before they can see your employment history and accomplishments allows you to see who viewed your profile, unless their own viewing settings are set private. But if you want to make it easy on recruiters (and you do!), make your full profile available to everyone without requiring a login. Add Video 2017 is already shaping up to be the year of video. YouTube has over a billion users to date, and that figure is only growing. The format's ubiquity is making it synonymous with web content overall—and that can be a good thing for job seekers. If you create videos that have anything to do with your job . . . host them on YouTube rather than another video channel. If you create videos that have anything to do with your job (tutorials, recordings of talks you've given), host them on YouTube rather than another video channel. The reason is simple: Google owns YouTube, and your goal is to rank well on Google. Use keywords and descriptions on your YouTube channel that explain who you are and highlight your job skills. Similar to LinkedIn, stay away from any internal lingo and go with general terms recruiters are likely to search for. Your videos show who you are more than a resume can, and in some cases these days, they may even be required as part of the interview process (particularly for remote-work positions). Whether your video is a quick personal introduction or an in-depth demonstration of your skills, make sure to include an action step as an annotation (here's how to do that on YouTube). Do you want people to email you? Visit your website? Provide that information right inside your video. Then connect the dots: Once you publish a clip on YouTube that demonstrates you who are, embed it on your website and add it to your LinkedIn profile. Keep Demonstrating Your Expertise Here's the thing about optimizing your web presence for search: It isn't a "one and done" sort of thing. You need to keep putting yourself out there somewhat frequently. Whatever social channels you use, you need to write—or talk—about what you can do.

It can be as simple as adding thoughtful comments on what others have posted or written. You could also talk about leaders you admire or people whose blogs you may follow, or mention a book you’re reading or an event you attended. But you'll want to do that wherever recruiters and hiring managers are already searching: LinkedIn, YouTube, public Facebook groups for people in your industry, your own website, etc. You should also keep checking your social media feeds for what other people are saying and look for ways to periodically add value to those discussions. Just stay at it. There’s a lot of noise out there, so you need repeated impressions to increase your brand strength. A stale social media profile won't help you stand out from the crowd. Grow Your Network These online efforts should dovetail with your offline activities and create a virtuous circle. Any time you go to a meeting or an event, connect online with the people you meet in person—just have a reason to connect. Mention something you discussed when you met, or highlight something else that makes you interesting as a connection. This isn't exactly an SEO tactic, but it can support the ones you've already implemented—for instance, by leading to a note from a recruiter who has a loose connection with you online. There’s a lot of noise out there, so you need repeated impressions to increase your brand strength. A final thought: Brands evolve (for that matter, so does Google's search algorithm), so your digital branding efforts need to do so as well. Even after a recruiter contacts you for the job of your dreams, continue to take action to strengthen your brand for the future. Whatever your personal brand may be at any given time, the right people always need to be able to find it with a simple search. Never stop Googling yourself.

The Galaxy Note 7 was a fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker The announcement will be livestreamed in Chinese, English and Korean on its websites. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, will give details of the probe. The Galaxy Note 7 was a fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker. Samsung recalled and eventually discontinued it after numerous reports of it overheating and bursting into flames. Initially, Samsung said it found a small error in the manufacturing process for some of the batteries in the phones was to blame. It replaced the phones with a new battery but those replaced phones also overheated and caught fire, prompting Samsung to pull the phones from the market. That cost Samsung at least $5 billion. The announcement comes after a South Korean court dismissed on Thursday a request by prosecutors to arrest Samsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong heir. Lee, the conglomerate's heir and de facto head, is under investigation for alleged bribery in connection with an influence-peddling scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. © 2017 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Get a Warrant   Cable, Phone Company Lines Blur   MORE IN BUSINESS BRIEFING Microsoft Beats Profit Expectations Verizon Eyeing Merger with Charter? Want To Track Phones? Get a Warrant Cable, Phone Company Lines Blur AI System Recognizes Skin Cancer Next Article > Microsoft Pilots Ebook Sales in Windows 10 By Danuta Kean. Updated January 22, 2017. Two years after Microsoft walked away from digital bookselling, a leak of its latest software has hinted that it may be ready to try again. In what may be a fishing exercise to gauge interest, a dedicated bookselling section features in a leaked build of the software giant’s Windows 10 update for phones. News that the company may enter digital bookselling was welcomed by publishers, although senior figures said they not been approached to supply titles to the store. Andrew Franklin, managing director of Profile Books, said: “The more competition in the field, the better.” Literary agent Gordon Wise, who also heads the Association of Authors’ Agents, said: “A lot of business goes through one retailer, so it is always very helpful to have other people taking up a book offering.” An early look at the new software by MSPowerUser showed a shop window for ebooks that, the website claimed, will be integrated into the Windows Store available across all platforms, including PC and mobile. It would plug a hole in Microsoft’s retail offer, which until now has included films, apps, games and music, but not books. According to Strategy Analytics, Microsoft currently only holds 14% of the tablet market. Microsoft played down the reports of an imminent entry into the book market and hinted that the leaked content may be little more than a teaser to gauge whether there would be widespread consumer interest. A spokeswoman told the Guardian: "We regularly test new features, and changes to existing features, to see what resonates well with our fans … stay tuned for more information soon." The provisionality of the new offering appeared confirmed by publishers, none of whom had been approached to negotiate terms of supply. These could prove a sticking point if they include demands for free content. Gordon Wise said that any enthusiasm felt by publishers would quickly die if Microsoft proposed giveaways or a Spotify-style service. "We're always very skeptical about subscription models and 'freemium' giveaways," he said. "As long as it keeps the value of a book, then it would be welcome." It is not the first time Microsoft has been linked to digital bookselling. In 2014, Barnes & Noble walked away from a deal with the software company after Microsoft invested $300m in a deal to distribute B&N's Nook app. At the time, Microsoft was reported to be withdrawing completely from the e-reader app market and rumored developments never materialized. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

The researchers note web users with active social media are vulnerable to the attack. Raising further questions about privacy on the internet, researchers from Princeton and Stanford universities have released a study showing that a specific person's online behavior can be identified by linking anonymous web browsing histories with social media profiles. "We show that browsing histories can be linked to social media profiles such as Twitter, Facebook or Reddit accounts," the researchers wrote in a paper scheduled for presentation at the 2017 World Wide Web Conference Perth, Australia, in April. "It is already known that some companies, such as Google and Facebook, track users online and know their identities," said Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton and one of the authors of the research article. But those companies, which consumers choose to create accounts with, disclose their tracking. The new research shows that anyone with access to browsing histories -- a great number of companies and organizations -- can identify many users by analyzing public information from social media accounts, Narayanan said. "Users may assume they are anonymous when they are browsing a news or a health website, but our work adds to the list of ways in which tracking companies may be able to learn their identities," said Narayanan, an affiliated faculty member at Princeton's Center for Information Technology Policy. Narayanan noted that the Federal Communications Commission recently adopted privacy rules for internet service providers that allow them to store and use consumer information only when it is "not reasonably linkable" to individual users. "Our results suggest that pseudonymous browsing histories fail this test," the researchers wrote. In the article, the authors note that online advertising companies build browsing histories of users with tracking programs embedded on webpages. Some advertisers attach identities to these profiles, but most promise that the web browsing information is not linked to anyone's identity. The researchers wanted to know if it were possible to de-anonymize web browsing and identify a user even if the web browsing history did not include identities. They decided to limit themselves to publicly available information. Social media profiles, particularly those that include links to outside webpages, offered the strongest possibility. The researchers created an algorithm to compare anonymous web browsing histories with links appearing in people's public social media accounts, called "feeds." "Each person's browsing history is unique and contains tell-tale signs of their identity," said Sharad Goel, an assistant professor at Stanford and an author of the study. The programs were able to find patterns among the different groups of data and use those patterns to identify users. The researchers note that the method is not perfect, and it requires a social media feed that includes a number of links to outside sites. However, they said that "given a history with 30 links originating from Twitter, we can deduce the corresponding Twitter profile more than 50 percent of the time." The researchers had even greater success in an experiment they ran involving 374 volunteers who submitted web browsing information. The researchers were able to identify more than 70 percent of those users by comparing their web browsing data to hundreds of millions of public social media feeds. (The number of original participants in the study was higher, but some users were eliminated because of technical problems in processing their information.) Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, an assistant professor at Imperial College London, said the research shows how "easy it is to build a full-scale 'de-anonymizationer' that needs nothing more than what's available to anyone who knows how to code." "All the evidence we have seen piling up over the years showing the strong limits of data anonymization, including this study, really emphasizes the need to rethink our approach to privacy and data protection in the age of big data," said de Montjoye, who was not involved in the project.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Continues to Advance against ISIL in Eastern Homs Syria: Army Repels ISIL's Attacks on Gov't Positions, Southeast of Aleppo Province Protests, Clashes in Various Areas of Bahrain Condemning Attack on Diraz Damascus: Residents Condemn Terrorists for Water Shortage During Rally Outside People's Assembly USA: Anti-Trump Protesters Decry Anti-Muslim Immigration Ban in DC Syria: At Least 2 Killed, 17 Wounded in Terrorists' Shelling in Aleppo Deadly Wildfire Razes Entire Town in Chile More Iraqi Civilians Head Back Home After ISIL Defeat, East of Mosul Regime-Change Reset: In Syria That Failed Idea Is About to Be Tested to Destruction Plasco Tragedy: Rescue Operation Nearing Ends Envoy: Iran Ready to Join China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Kuwait Optimistic About Expanding Relations with Iran Iran Exports Shipment of Gas Condensate to Japan Commander: IRGC Air Force to Hold Massive Military Drills Soon Iran Calls for Implementing Bilateral MoUs with Azerbaijan Syrian Army Continues to Advance against ISIL in Eastern Homs TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army units continued military operations towards the al-Quaryatayn road and the Eastern parts of the two regions of Taloul al-Tayas and the Fourth Station, killing and wounding several ISIL terrorists.

With the addition of Amazon Video in 4K HDR, SHIELD TV offers the largest, most open catalog of media in stunning 4K – also supporting Netflix, YouTube and Google Play Movies(1). YouTube’s flagship TV app will also be available for SHIELD TV in the coming months, delivering immersive, 360-degree viewing experiences. Amazing Games SHIELD TV stands alone among media streamers, with the widest range of gaming capabilities and richest assortment of game content. Its library of games has been expanded to thousands of titles, with the ability coming soon to stream Ubisoft’s catalog of hits, including The Division, FarCry Primal, Watch Dogs 2, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, For Honor and countless others. New Ubisoft games will also be available, simultaneous with their PC release. NVIDIA is expanding the GeForce NOW constantly with new releases nearly every week. Today we are also No Man’s Sky by Hello Games to the Cloud Gaming platform.  SHIELD TV also continues to add hit franchises to the platform natively. Upcoming games include, Tomb Raider, Shadowgun Legends and The Witness. The latter is available today on the Google PlayStore. AI in the Home In the coming months, SHIELD TV will be expanded with a series of AI capabilities that transforms home entertainment: First hands-free Google Assistant integration on TV. Google has optimized the Assistant experience on TV by having the home’s largest screen show visual answers in addition to an audio reply. Use voice commands to replace clicking a remote for finding content, pausing, fast-forwarding or rewinding. Plus, Google Assistant can help better find content and answer questions. SmartThings Hub technology integration, instantly turning SHIELD into a smart home hub that can connect to hundreds of smart home devices. NVIDIA SPOT™, an AI mic accessory that makes SHIELD the central backbone of the AI home, extending intelligent control throughout the house. Coming later this year. Pricing and Availability SHIELD TV is available now and will ship in the UK as well as other select European countries, the United States and Canada for £189.99, including controller and remote. SHIELD Pro will also be available later this month with controller, remote with headset jack and 500GB of storage. The new controller is also sold separately for £59.99.

The update brings the Amazon Video app which also has HDR shows and Youtube I think. As for the Smart Things Hub, I think both the old and new console are getting that update and it's out for neither yet - same as google assistant. I don't think the old controller/remote support always listening though.
