Amazon and Google could get some tough competition from Apple in the smart speaker segment. Apple is reportedly developing a smart speaker, similar to that of Amazon Echo and Google Home. The leak comes from prolific tipster Sonny Dickson. “Apple is currently finalizing designs for their Apple competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device”, Dickson said on Twitter. Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 He later added: “It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS”. Dickson told Mashable’s Jen Ryall that the smart speaker will sport a design that’s inspired by the Mac Pro, and the UE Boom’s mesh styling.  Dickson did not mention anything about a release date for the device, or a price. He however believes that Apple could launch the device at this year’s WWDC. More from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor. – Concave top with the controls, fat with the speaker mesh portion covering it all. 1/2 — Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 AirPlay functionality in the upcoming in the Siri-powered speaker has been reported before, alongside a Siri DK release, notes 9to5Mac. However, the surprising part is that speaker speaker will include “Beats technology”. It’s being said that Apple might add Beat’s audio tech into its own smart speaker system. This is not the first time we’re hearing that Apple is developing a smart speaker. Back in May 2016, The Information reported that Apple could launch an “Amazon Eco-like device with a speaker and microphone built-in”. At that time, it was suggested that the device could be launched at the company’s annual WWDC. Two months later, CNET reported that Apple’s Siri-powered speaker would be “self-aware” abd able to detect the people who are in close proximity to the device using “on-board” cameras equipped with some sort of facial recognition software. In February 2017, however,  Times’s Tim Bajarin said that Apple was no longer interested in developing an intelligent speaker. Instead, Apple is “more interested in turning Siri into an omnipresent AI assistant across devices, rather than designing a single device specifically to serve as a Siri machine”. Amazon’s Echo is perhaps the most popular voice-based smart speaker on the market today. Earlier in the week, the company revealed its latest Echo device, the Echo Look that comes with a built-in cameras. Amazon’s Echo devices are powered by the company’s Alexa assistant.

Owens Published: Apr 29, 2017 4:31 p.m. ET Share Head of Alphabet’s largest division made nearly $200 million in 2016, twice as much as any CEO tracked in the past two years Getty Images Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai received $199.7 million in total compensation in 2016, Alphabet reported Friday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Alphabet Inc. awarded Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai nearly $200 million in total compensation in 2016, more than twice as much as any CEO of a publicly traded company tracked in the last two years. In its annual proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed Friday, Alphabet GOOGL, +3.71% GOOG, +3.63% revealed that Pichai was awarded $198.7 million in Alphabet stock in 2016. That is roughly double the stock Pichai received in 2015, when he was named chief executive of Google after the company reorganized as Alphabet. Don’t miss: 5 things to know about Google CEO Sundar Pichai Along with a $650,000 salary and $372,000 in recognized compensation in the form of personal security and flights, Pichai received total compensation of $199.7 million in 2016. That was nearly double his 2015 total compensation of $100.7 million. Pichai’s total compensation tops the CEO compensation packages tracked by Equilar for the past two years. In 2015, Dara Khosrowshahi of Expedia Inc. EXPE, -1.82% had the highest compensation among CEOs of publicly traded companies, at $94.6 million, according to Equilar’s annual study. Among proxy statements filed before April 1, Equilar found Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications Inc. CHTR, -1.04% was the highest-paid CEO for 2016, at more than $98 million. Pichai, though, would not show up on Equilar’s list because he is not the CEO of a publicly traded company, but rather of the Google subsidiary within Alphabet. Alphabet CEO Larry Page is the executive who would show up in Equilar’s annual study, and Page—along with fellow Google founder and Alphabet President Sergey Brin—accepted only $1 in annual salary and no stock compensation, according to the filing. Equilar spokesman Dan Marcec confirmed that Pichai was not included in the firm’s annual CEO-compensation study because of the quirks of Alphabet’s corporate structure. He said Pichai is “probably” the highest-paid top executive in the land. See also: The CEO of your company probably earns 276 times more than you do Equilar reported earlier this month that the early returns from its annual effort showed CEO pay on the rise, with median CEO compensation up 6% to $15 million and average compensation increasing from $15.5 million to $16.6 million. It is the largest increase tracked since 2013. Pichai received a $199 million equity award upon his promotion, Alphabet disclosed last year, and this year’s filing showed an additional $209 million biennial equity award issued in early 2016 that vests quarterly. The completion of the first award and beginning of the second appeared to lead to Pichai’s large total compensation for 2016. Other key Google execs fell between the Pichai and Page extremes: Diane Greene, who was hired to run Google’s cloud business late in 2015, received total compensation of $43.7 million in 2016, and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat received total compensation of slightly more than $39 million. Such large compensation awards are not unheard of among executives at large tech companies, especially when they receive big stock awards upon being hired or promoted. For instance, Tim Cook was handed a $378 million stock award when he was named CEO of Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.10% in 2011, making him the highest paid CEO that year. Last year, Cook’s total compensation took a hit, falling to $8.75 million from $10.28 million the year before, but he still has a massive cache of Apple shares. Since Google reorganized as Alphabet and made Pichai CEO of the Google division, Google stock has gained 39.1%, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.19% has risen about 14.8% over that period. The stock hit fresh record highs Friday after Alphabet beat earnings expectations, and Alphabet is the only company besides Apple with a market capitalization of more than $600 billion.

Scroll Staff Published Yesterday · 04:10 pm.   Wikimedia Commons Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai received almost $200 million (approximately Rs 1,285 crore) as a compensation package in 2016. The company attributed it to the Indian-born executive’s “numerous successful product launches”, CNN reported. A majority of the remuneration was in company stock, whose value is estimated to be around $198.7 million in securities documents. Pichai was granted the package a few months after he took over the position in 2015 from Google co-founder Larry Page, who received $1 as annual pay. Page has an estimated fortune of $41 billion. Pichai still reports to Page under the restructured management. The 44-year-old Pichai also received a $6,50,000 salary in 2016 excluding the personal security services and air travel valued provided at an estimated $3,72,000, AP reported. Google’s sales from its core advertising and YouTube business has been on the rise under Pichai’s leadership. The company has also invested in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing since he took over. We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in.

You crawl out of bed, go for a quick shower, pull out and wear your neatly ironed clothes at the speed of light and then rush out of the house, making sure you have your keys and wallet in place. Giphy You walk into office, relieved because you have made it to work on time. Stifling yawns and checking emails, you wonder how your colleagues are charged up and buzzing with energy. “What is wrong with these people” you mumble to yourself. Giphy Slowly, you start to change. You start snapping at colleagues and start arguing with your computer. You take out your frustration on anything or anyone in sight. To add to the aggressive behaviour, you’ve completely lost your focus. After some time, you simply forget what you were doing. Giphy Unable to bear the hunger pangs, you go for a mid-morning snack. It is only when a colleague asks you for a bite do you realize that you have developed into a fully formed, hunger fueled, monster. Try not to look at yourself in the mirror. Giphy If only you had spared not even twenty or ten but just 5 minutes in the morning and not skipped breakfast, your story would look completely different - as you will see in this video. Play The fast dip in your mood and lack of focus is because your body has missed its most important meal of the day – breakfast. Research has shown that skipping a meal, especially in the morning, worsens the mood because there is a drop in the blood sugar. This in turn affects the levels of serotonin and dopamine, the chemicals produced in the brain that control our moods and feelings. In simpler English, not having breakfast is going to make you really cranky and confused! Morning is also when the body needs maximum nutrition to function efficiently through the day as you’ve just woken up from a full 7 hours of no food (and if you’re sleeping less than that, that’s a whole other article). So in short, having a breakfast could make you go from looking like the earlier GIFs to this: Giphy But with changing lifestyles and most people hard pressed for time, a healthy breakfast is taking the backseat. However, it doesn’t have to be that way. MTR has come up with a range of widely loved Indian delicacies like Poha, Upma and Halwa which can be made in (hold you breath) just 3 minutes! All you have to do is add hot water and wait for 3 minutes to get a delicious and filling breakfast. Giphy These amazing and delicious breakfasts can be made in a jiffy and consumed with the least hassle, even in the midst of your frenetic morning routine.

I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police!

It looks fantastic :) Corbin Davenport Gladly! http://www.ebay.com/itm/First-Order-Trooper-vinyl-decal-sticker-STAR-WARS-Force-Awakens-/171760424579 EcE Any particular reason your smartwatches stopped working? I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. JasonIvers Just use Cloudflare... They provide SSL, as well as DDOS protection, etc, for free. It takes basically no work, or even much knowledge, to set it up. Then, if you want to do your own later, you can, but people will be able to use https on the mean time. Artem Russakovskii We already do use Cloudflare, including their SSL, but it's not so simple with our setup for reasons I don't want to explain. We made it work on apkmirror already, and AP is coming. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Da Fuq Agreed, but it's gonna be pretty expensive. New CPU, MB and DDR4 RAM. JD Still cheaper than an Intel setup. Once you consider the performance gain you can't afford to not upgrade Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers. Michael Hazell Must be nice to be able to afford expensive devices like the Pixel. I maintain my stance that there really hasn't been a successor to the OnePlus One since its inception because no future model has come to its price point.

(Reuters) SYDNEY: Alphabet Inc.’s Google said it would challenge amended tax assessments issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which is trying to claw back billions of dollars from multinational corporations citing unpaid taxes. The ATO has increased scrutiny over how much tax multinationals operating in Australia pay. In December, it said it was pursuing seven global businesses over AU$2 billion ($1.50 billion) in unpaid tax. While the ATO has not named the businesses it is pursuing, Google’s Australia unit said in accounts filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) that it will “lodge an objection” to the tax demand from the ATO. “The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims,” Google said in the financial statement released on Friday.

Australia enacted the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law in December 2015 and the ATO has introduced new guidelines for foreign trading hubs.

The idea of a “gender pay gap” has caused much controversy over the past decade. According to Google Books’ Ngram Viewer, which shows trends in the usage of specific words or phrases in books, the usage of “gender pay gap” has steadily been increasing since 1980. Of course, this only reflects the phrase’s occurrence in books, whether in print or online. However, it does not encompass every news article, blog post, Facebook status, tweet, etc. How ironic it is that Google is the one under accusation of contributing to this gender pay gap? On Friday, April 7, a court hearing took place. In a report published by The Guardian, U.S. Department of Labor regional director, Janette Wipper, revealed the official allegations against Google: “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across [Google’s] entire workforce.” However, Google denied these statements, saying that there was no gender pay gap between their male and female employees. Eileen Naughton, Google’s Vice President of People Operations, testified regarding Google’s pay equality, citing Google’s annual salary analysis that is “extremely scientific and robust” and “gender blind.” It seems as though either Google or the feds are wrong, but could it be possible that both sides of the argument are – to an extent – true? According to an analysis by Dr. Andrew Chamberlain, the chief economist of Glassdoor, a site where employees can rate companies and management, this could actually be the case. On Glassdoor, employees self-reported their salaries, and Chamberlain examined these for Google employees. Although this data did not encompass all of Google’s employees, it served as a good sample size for the company. Chamberlain’s findings were quite interesting. According to Chamberlain’s findings, overall, Google pays women 16 percent less than it pays men. On the surface, this may seem disturbing – but that is not the entire picture. Fewer women work in high-ranking positions at Google relative to the number of men working in those positions. Chamberlain says, “In our sample of Google salaries, men and women are definitely not equally represented among job titles. For example, about 52 percent of males in our data worked as highly paid software engineers, while just 21 percent of women worked in those roles. By contrast, 6 percent of women in the sample worked as product marketing managers, while just 2 percent of men worked in those roles.” This is a concept known as “occupational segregation.” Although men and women may be paid the same across one position, just the fact that there may be more men in higher paying jobs contributes at least 54 percent to the gender pay gap according to Chamberlain’s research. In fact, this situation is not unique to Google; it is characteristic of many other technology companies. From this lawsuit, it is clear that the idea of the “gender pay gap” in America needs to be reexamined.

Search giant Google in Singapore has tied up from local running group JustRunLah! to capture photographs of popular running routes like Singapore Botanic Gardens, Mount Faber Park and MacRitchie Reservoir, among others. The group aims to cover more than 30 running routes spanning over 400km in the next few months. They plan to cover one on a “two-to-three week” basis after undergoing training sessions with the Google team, said Peter Tan, Managing Director, JustRunLah!, who also runs an online lifestyle and community site targeted at runners. As a running enthusiast himself, he hopes the project will encourage more people to lead an active lifestyle, as well as allow runners to plan their treks ahead of time. “Utimately, if you are not very familiar with the place and have not done any research, there’s a possibility you may turn a wrong one... With this project, I hope there’s the possibility of better planning. Anyone with a smartphone will see their route going forward, and if there’s any chance of getting lost, you can make your way back as well,” said Tan. Members of the group will take turns to don Google’s Street View trekker — a 20kg and 1.2m tall “wearable backpack” — as they traverse around the island’s running routes. The Street View trekker has 15 cameras mounted at the top for 360˚ panoramic imagery. Only two sets are currently available in Singapore, and one will be loaned to JustRunLah!. On Thursday, members of the group, including Tan, had their first go at the trekker while walking on the Marang trail at Mount Faber. Because of the size and weight of the equipment, individuals using the trekker have been advised not to run for safety reasons, and also to capture the images of best quality. According to Google, roughly one in five searches on their search engine are location-related, especially searches from mobile devices. More than a third of mobile queries are related to location, the company said. “We can see that location clearly matters to people, and so it’s our goal to provide the most comprehensive, accurate and easy-to-use maps and make them accessible to as many people as possible,” said Cynthia Wei, Street View Programme Manager, APAC. Users who are interested to contribute to Street View can download the app on the Google Play and iOS app store. — TODAY                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Morocco’s Christian converts emerge from the shadows Google ties up with Singapore’s JustRunLah! to offer street views of popular running trails Chaos-hit ‘Coachella for the super rich’ promises refunds — and comeback (VIDEO) Tabiyo Shop: A place for designer notebooks and stationery... in Seremban!

Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Name and Shame, Educating the Media Fake News · Information Warfare Alt-News, Fake News, Russian Propaganda and Russian Proxy Websites Under Increased Scrutiny and Crackdown April 29, 2017 Joel Harding I read this article on RINF.com with interest, Google now threatening Alt-News web-sites.  Apparently, the crackdown on fake news is directly impacting what is also called the “Alternative News” or alt-news community. That is good news, in my opinion. One of my favorite ‘alternative’ journalists, an American working in East Ukraine, highlighted the article. “He” is published almost exclusively on those sites.  I put “he” in quotation marks because some of my Ukrainian friends believe he is a she. There is no record of his name in Ukraine. The article points out that Google is removing articles from these fake news sites. As they say in the article: “Google have an agenda.” Seeing as they’re professional journalists, it should be “Google HAS an agenda”.  But it is true, Google, Facebook, and other social media websites are aggressively removing these trash sites from the internet. In the article, there is a list of alt-news sites for me to balance against my Russian News And Russian Proxy News Sites and Conspiracy Theory Sites.  RINF is a new one, most of the rest I recognize. I believe it was Zerohedge that threw a conniption for being labeled a fake-news site last year… RINF.com washingtonsblog.com globalresearch.ca zerohedge.com sott.netoff-guardian.org strategic-culture.org countercurrents.org greanvillepost.com thepeoplesvoice.org The good news is that Google and others are aggressively policing up the crap sites which post junk on the internet. Junk, fake news, alternative news, alt-news. It’s about time. Thank you, Google and Facebook!

[Deal Alert] Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/21 8:48am PDTApr 21, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 46 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Deals News Pixel It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016.

Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response?

Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5.

When Facebook broadcast the horrific Thai murder of an 11-month-old baby, Natalie Jiranuch, hanged by her own father, it was a full 24 hours before the corporate giant removed the unspeakable video footage. By then it had been seen by 370,000 people, including the baby’s distraught mother, Jiranuch Trirat. Just a few days earlier, in Cleveland, Ohio, a pensioner called Robert Godwin was out collecting aluminium cans when Steve Stephens, 37, approached and shot him dead, muttering: ‘I’m about to kill this man right here, the old dude.’ This killing was put on Facebook Live – a murder which then remained visible to a supposedly civilised world for a full two hours. Mark Zuckerberg, pictured left, Google chief Eric Schmidt, pictured right, and others must be made to operate under the same tight rules and laws as newspapers, says Yasmin Alibhai-Brown And how did Facebook respond to these snuff videos and the torrent of justified criticism? By asking the rest of us, effectively, to do their job for them. ‘We are reviewing flows to make sure people can report videos and other materials that violate our standards as easily and quickly as possible,’ said a spokesman. ‘We know we need to do better.’ It does not take a tech expert to know that this was corporate bilge. The big beasts of new media believe they are untouchable and unaccountable. And this has to change. There is little that could match the brutality of these two on-line killings, yet they belong in a cesspit of appalling material that is freely available online.

Share this article Share At its terrible worst it means terrorist slaughter, the torture of disabled people and young women, gang rapes, violent porn, child abuse, suicide and self-harm sites. Easily accessed, they are desensitising people, coarsening cultures, distorting values. Google lost millions of pounds last month when major companies pulled their advertising because their products were being promoted next to extremist YouTube videos. On that occasion, Google did act, and fast. Money counts, it seems. People do not. But online abuse is not confined to a world of murderous outrages. Instead it has seeped into an everyday existence in which trolls, for example, are free to be as intimidating and malicious as they please. Companies like Facebook, pictured, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, project themselves as the slick makers of a brave new world where old rules like financial and social integrity are passé (stock photo) Women and people of colour are viciously targeted. A friend of mine, a female Muslim local councillor, tried to kill herself after a particularly nasty week. In this virtual world there is no limit to the aggression hiding beneath a cloak of digital anonymity. Of course we cannot blame Twitter, Facebook or Google for everything. Degrading online material is a new, unprecedented problem that affects the internet as a whole. But the leading figures of the industry bear a particular responsibility. The men who took us into the jungle do nothing to civilize the space – even though it is they who make the billions of pounds and dollars. Perhaps it is their very novelty which allows them to get away with it. Companies like Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, project themselves as the slick makers of a brave new world where old rules like financial and social integrity are passé. I have been to both Google and Facebook premises in London. When you enter, it is like passing the toughest border control, but once inside, you can only be impressed. These are delightful, intellectual playgrounds with hammocks, roof gardens and fabulous restaurants. It’s the strangest combination of secrecy and transparency, conformity and blue-sky thinking. And yes, these new corporations can be a force for good. The internet is an indispensable part of modern life. It has fast become as vital as fire, light, water and air. But those services, remember, are under some kind of state supervision. Google, pictured, lost millions of pounds last month when major companies pulled their advertising because their products were being promoted next to extremist YouTube videos (stock photo) Not so the controllers of the new, essential utility. They are lawless, hubristic, all powerful with businesses more profitable than any other sector has been through history. The most successful oil firms earn but hundreds of millions; Google, Facebook et al make billions. This is why the reprehensibly cold, nihilistic enterprises have put themselves above all laws, tax regimes and regulation. They are destroying government revenues and wilfully undermine democracies. Because they can. In his excellent report, Tech Giants And Civic Power, Martin Moore of King’s College, London, expresses grave concern at the erosion of citizen rights as ungovernable internet companies take over the universe. Yes, the internet can be an effective political tool for citizens who wish to hold the authorities to account – in some circumstances. But remember this, too. Around the world, the internet is as likely to be used by governments to misinform or spy. In many respects, the internet wields the power of a broadcasting system – but one without controls. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown says visiting the Google offices in London is 'like passing the toughest border control'. Pictured is the company's chief executive Eric Schmidt speaking in Hertfordshire in 2013 The most successful oil firms earn but hundreds of millions; Facebook et al make billions. Pictured is the social network's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg speaking at a conference in the US state of California earlier this month Truth itself and basic decency too have been corrupted by the tech companies. Now the carriers of fake news want to ‘educate’ users so they can spot the lies and fabrications. Its just another planned, cynical, change-nothing strategy. Professor Gabriel Kahn, of the University of South California, warned last year that: ‘Facebook and Google are essentially polluting an information ecosystem with trash, with garbage, and it is clear that garbage has an impact.’ This is everywhere. The internet is affecting impressionable people, children in particular. It is normalising sexual violence, encouraging discrimination and distorting elections. The big operators now own and manipulate nations, communities and families. They do so without any sense of social, economic, political or democratic responsibility. Zuckerberg, Google chief Eric Schmidt and others must be made to operate under the same tight rules and laws as newspapers and the traditional broadcast media. The internet giants have got away with too much for too long and have been contemptuous of fairness, accuracy, redress and consumer care – all the principles of good journalism. Businesses which advertise on these sites must exert moral pressure too and more importantly, governments and international agencies must act to tame the cabal which has become a far bigger danger to humanity than any global conflict or megalomaniac leader.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos EXCLUSIVE: Woman in burka dragged off bus by undercover police Heineken ad brings together people who are 'worlds apart' Shocking video emerges of Delta Airlines pilot HITTING passenger Charlie Watkins' Take Me Out date filmed shortly before his death Calm cashier keeps his cool as armed robber threatens him with gun Harrowing footage shows Derry McCann stalking a woman Russian army tests remote controlled state-of-the-art tank Pack of killer whales attack mother gray whale and her calf Two women bloodied after fight over Brexit during UKIP campaign FLOTUS Trump dedicates a 'healing' garden at Children's National hospital Total wreckage in Afghanistan after MOAB strike destroys site Terrifying footage of a huge rhino chasing after a motorbike 'The best first date ever': Viewers left in tears as they...

What We Use, 2017 Edition: The stuff Corbin can't live without Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 8:26am PDTApr 28, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Features What We Use Series Article Contents 1 Hardware 1.0.1 Phone: Google Pixel 1.0.2 Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 1.0.3 Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' 1.0.4 Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') 1.0.5 Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) 1.0.6 Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 1.0.7 Smart speaker: Google Home 1.0.8 Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE 1.0.9 Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 1.0.10 Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock 2 Software 2.0.1 Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) 2.0.2 Signal Spy (Android) 2.0.3 InputMapper (Windows) 2.0.4 Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) 3 Conclusion You may recall Android Police's long-running 'What We Use' series, where the fantastic people that work here share the tech (and sometimes non-tech) products they use on a frequent basis. I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police!

It looks fantastic :) Corbin Davenport Gladly! http://www.ebay.com/itm/First-Order-Trooper-vinyl-decal-sticker-STAR-WARS-Force-Awakens-/171760424579 EcE Any particular reason your smartwatches stopped working? I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. JasonIvers Just use Cloudflare... They provide SSL, as well as DDOS protection, etc, for free. It takes basically no work, or even much knowledge, to set it up. Then, if you want to do your own later, you can, but people will be able to use https on the mean time. Artem Russakovskii We already do use Cloudflare, including their SSL, but it's not so simple with our setup for reasons I don't want to explain. We made it work on apkmirror already, and AP is coming. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Da Fuq Agreed, but it's gonna be pretty expensive. New CPU, MB and DDR4 RAM. JD Still cheaper than an Intel setup. Once you consider the performance gain you can't afford to not upgrade Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers. Michael Hazell Must be nice to be able to afford expensive devices like the Pixel. I maintain my stance that there really hasn't been a successor to the OnePlus One since its inception because no future model has come to its price point.

Amazon Tap firmware update enables Echo-style hands free voice commands Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2017/02/09 6:03pm PDTFeb 9, 2017 6 Plus 1 on G+ 52 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares113 Accessories Amazon Here's an interesting example of a product getting better with age. The Amazon Tap speaker was introduced as a mobile, battery-powered alternative to the Echo, with access to the same Alexa voice commands, but limited in that it could only accept said commands with a button press. This made the less-expensive Tap, while interesting, not all that much better than a smartphone for voice searches. But the latest firmware update from Amazon enables hands-free Alexa commands, like the Echo and Google's Assistant on the Google Home. Talk about a value add. The new update can be downloaded and applied via the Amazon Alexa Android app. Once installed, the always-on voice feature can be turned on via the app whenever the speaker has a Wi-Fi connection available. The Tap should last for about 8 hours on a full charge even while always listening, and it can be put to sleep with a single button press when you're done with it. The new update actually makes the Amazon Tap something of a misnomer - tapping is no longer required. This new feature makes the Tap functionally identical to the Echo (albeit without some of the larger device's fancy omni-directional speaker tech) at a $50 discount and a much smaller form factor. For that matter, the $130 Amazon Tap is the same price as the Google Home, and comes with untethered battery use, too. Considering how much of a head start Amazon has on Google in the voice assistant gadget category, the new update can be seen as a savvy strike at the competition.

Although I just found out it had this shortcoming since I don't own any. The smart thing would have been to enable always listening while charging and button activation when on battery. Either way, I invested in the Google Home. Just a smarter investment into the real Android Ecosystem. Schmaltzy Not really. 64bitprocessor Apple would never add a feature improvement such as this in any of their devices, they would claim the hardware is not capable (siri + iPhone 4/s, cough). Google could do the same for Nexus by giving them Assistant too. Nice unexpected update, thanks Amazon. Grayson Well Apple did add Siri voice assistant to my 2013 and 2015 MacBook Pros last year.... sooo.... Mariatklein Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Grayson ? Does Google have a voice assistant on Chromebooks? If so, how long did it take them? Matt Now I'm not sure whether to go for an Amazon dot/echo or wait for Google Home to come to the UK. bekifft Wait for Google Home version 2.0 to launch with better microphones. YaKillaCJ This will be when I get another. Although by then it may not be needed since it's coming to AndroidTV. That and Google Assistant (for Home) features are being added into the Google Assistant (for Pixel aka phones). But yea, more mics and higher volume speakers would be nice. Not that the speakers are bad, in fact the sound quality is great, just wish it was louder. Another upgrade would be an aux out (3.5mm/TosLink) jack found on the Chromecast Audio would be nice. Willie Chalmers III I'd say Google has about six months before they really lose their foothold into the voice assistant space if they don't act quickly. I'll admit, Google does have a different strategy for its assistant, but they really need to bring it to more devices to compete with Alexa, the household name for voice assistants. I really hope they bring it to all devices by the end of this year or when Pixel 2 comes out. On Amazon doing this: I think it's great that they're able to maintain their profitability while having competitors' functionality. JW Let's see. The tap is less expensive, have battery to use anywhere, and more portable. Why would anyone buy the echo? Just for the slightly better speaker? CRA21K Echo has 7 microphones, which result in accurate voice detection. ericshmerick Yah, spec war won, but I've never had an issue with the Tap's mic(s?) Unless you scream across the house at your Echo, the Tap is now a great buy for versatility. CRA21K Its about far field recognition, which I mean t not the spec war. If the tap mic works across the room when I call alexa then that should be fine. Ajmobileguru you might as well use the Echo Dot. Works all the time unless you have a loudspeaker blaring in front of it. The echo series of products has a long way to go and can definitely become a lot smarter like answering more types of questions.Google assistant and home win big time in answering questions and contextual awareness. Todd Far from slightly better speaker. My echo sounds fantastic in our open floorplan living room kitchen area, the Tap sounds great in a single room, but isn't nearly as full sounding in larger rooms. bekifft I find the Echo hears me better (the dot and the full size, haven't tried the tap) but Google Home actually gets the result I wanted more often when it does hear me. I wish it had the omnidirectional microphones, that would help a lot. Still prefer Google Home to Echo, though Google Home is a terrible name. Google must have inherited from Microsoft its terrible naming habits. floydmaster I've had the same impression. My Echo is much better at consistently hearing me, but Home is usually offers better results. The big advantage the Home has for me right now is the ability to play videos through my Chromecast. I also like the news summaries offered by the Home better. The Echo seems to be much better hardware, though. steb0ne Amazon it seems is trying hard to not let Google Home take market share in this space or something... that it's kinda harming itself adding features like this to this will hurt Echo sells IMO. SN: I never had a problem with Home hearing me but maybe it's cuz I live in an apartment, lol! Wes Not really, The Echo has its own benefits such as better audio and looks better. I think Amazon has done a good job delineating a clear product line. I have a Dot and a Tap. Use both and I would have gotten an Echo but we really wanted a portable device that could be taken around the house. ericshmerick Well then, I may have a use for it now. Having to press the button made me toss it in a drawer. Now it may live on my nightstand... Smartass #NotMyPissPres! Finally! Rob Cook My Tap just got a hell of a lot more useful! deepdvd You actually got the update? Mine doesn't seem to want to. Rob Cook No, speaking for when it arrives, still waiting... deepdvd Okay, let me fix that... "My Tap will get a hell of a lot more useful!" Rob Cook Got it, yesterday. Works like a charm, just have to flip a button in the settings to enable the 'always on' voice detection. Now I can confidently say my Tap is a hell of a lot more useful ;) Schmaltzy Did you finally get the update? I was just informed by Amazon that some Taps won't auto-update immediately and could take 1 or 2 days after you set up the device. If that doesn't happen, contact Amazon customer service and speak with tech support. Just received my Tap and it's got software from March, 2016. deepdvd Yeah, I got it. It just took what seemed forever. deepdvd Is there a way to force an update? Schmaltzy Note: the Amazon Tap may not have have the hands-free option software update when you receive it and apparently, that update cannot be forced. Amazon support said I should keep it plugged in for 48 hours (so it doesn't run out of juice while receiving update). He said within that time frame it should auto-update but if not, to call Amazon C.S. back and speak with technical support. Sami Ahmed How do you update the firmware on your tap?

Inside OzHarvest Market: The Grocery Store Where You Set Your Own Price Everything Coming To Netflix, Stan, Amazon And Foxtel This May 18 Ways To Make Your Online Accounts More Secure David Nield Apr 30, 2017, 10:00am Share Image: Screenshot Your existence is scattered across the internet. You likely have accounts at forums you haven't been to in a decade, and social media services so bereft of users they resemble graveyards. And each and every one of those accounts is a potential avenue into your private life for a hacker. So you need to secure them. These are some of the best ways to keep those accounts secure — and they're all quick and simple to do, so you've got no excuses. 1) Close the accounts you're not using Image: Screenshot Here's what happens to your old, unused accounts on the web: They get hacked. And sometimes they lead the way to the more valuable accounts that you really do care about, so it makes sense to keep the number of accounts you're using down to a minimum. As an added bonus it means you've got fewer usernames and passwords to worry about. 2) Set up a password manager Speaking of usernames and passwords, there are apps that can help out here. Not only do password managers like 1Password or LastPass manage all of your various login credentials for you, they can also generate ultra-secure passwords, saving you from having to remember lots of different ones or resorting to using the same one for everything. 3) Add two-factor verification We've been banging the two-factor verification drum for a while now, and you can set it up on most online accounts, including ones for Apple, Google and Microsoft. It means even if someone gets ahold of your username and password, they won't be able to log into your account on a new device without an extra code delivered over SMS or through an app. Which means they will need physical access to your devices. 4) Protect your password resets Image: Screenshot How easy is it for someone to reset your passwords? If one of your email addresses gets compromised, your social networks could be next, but there are ways to stop this — like checking the Require personal information to reset my password tickbox in Settings on Twitter (under the Account tab), and ensuring your "secret questions" are strong ones. 5) Check your account activity Many of your online accounts let you check up on recent activity — you can head to this page for Facebook and this page for Google, for example — and it's worth doing this regularly to make sure nothing seems amiss. You can typically log out of all sessions but the current one, and revoke account authorizations for any devices you don't recognise. 6) Delete third-party account connections There's nothing inherently wrong with letting other apps and services connect to your Facebook and Twitter, but you should keep these connections to a minimum and remove any you're not using, to block off any potential avenues for hackers to use. You can easily manage your connected apps online for your Google, Twitter and Facebook accounts. 7) Keep your software updated Image: Screenshot Many a vulnerability comes through outdated software, so you should always make sure your operating systems and browsers are right up to date to keep your computer secure and by extension the online accounts you access through them. Thankfully, most software packages now auto-update seamlessly enough, so it's not difficult to stay up to date. 8) Trust no one You'll hear this mantra a lot if you watch X-Files, and it's one you should repeat to yourself whenever you receive an email or social media message with dubious contents. Beware of following links without any context and be aware that phishing scams continue to get smarter and trickier to spot. Think before you click and read up on the latest threats. 9) Get extra help Unless you install something really sketchy and terrible, antivirus programs and other bits of security software can't do any harm and may well do a lot of good — like guarding against the phishing attacks we've just mentioned. There are plenty of good free and paid-for security packages out there for whatever devices you happen to be using. 10) Specify your trusted contacts Image: Screenshot If someone should boot you out of your Facebook account, you can get your friends to let you back in, as long as you tell Facebook who you trust beforehand — go to Security in Settings to set this up. It's simple but effective: Facebook sends your friends one-off codes you can use to regain access, codes which they're told to only pass on to you. 11) Change your passwords regularly If you've got a password manager set up (see above) then this might be taken care of for you but whatever your situation you should be changing your passwords on a regular basis, and we do mean all of them. You've then got much less to worry about should a big batch of them become available to hackers, because you'll likely have changed yours. 12) Use a secret email address If someone knows your email address, they're halfway to knowing how to log into your accounts — and these days it's not that difficult to find out someone's email address. Setting up a private email address (that doesn't really relate to your name) solely for logging into your social media accounts is another way of keeping them more secure. 13) Do you know where your phone is? Image: Screenshot Our mobile phones are gateways to many an online account so you need to keep them well protected. That involves both setting up remote wipe capabilities for if your device gets lost (see the instructions for iOS and Android), and making sure your devices are completely and securely wiped should you be selling them or passing them on. 14) Stay informed One of the easiest but most effective ways of keeping your accounts secure is just to keep up with the tech news — something we can help with. If you know about the latest threats and breaches, and how to deal with them, you won't be caught out. Of course, keeping your active accounts down to a minimum (see the first point) is going to help here too. 15) Install a VPN We've written before about staying safe on public Wi-Fi and if you spend a lot of time in coffee shops or at hotels then the investment in a solid VPN application is well worth it. As well as letting you spoof your location if you need to, it also adds an extra layer of security to the data you're sending and receiving, making it harder for anyone else to listen in. 16) Add PIN code protection Image: Wachiwit/Shutterstock.com A PIN code or password login on your phone or laptop is all that stands in the way of passing strangers and your online accounts, so make sure there's one in place. Whether your devices offer password protection, or fingerprint ID sensing, or facial recognition, or iris scanning, make sure there's something there that stops other people from logging in. 17) Keep your accounts to yourself On a related note, it's well worth setting up your own account on your computer or your browser or your tablet to keep other people away from your important accounts. We're not saying your toddler or your housemate is actively trying to hack into your Facebook but from a security perspective it's always best to limit access as much as possible. 18) Watch what you share online Your accounts are only as secure as the weakest links protecting them — and those links often involve someone impersonating you. Make sure personal details that can be used to verify your identity, like your home address, your birthday, or even what soccer team you support (is that your "secret security question"?) aren't all over your social media profiles.

A Scientist Reviews Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 A Tech Bro Charged Thousands For An Island Getaway That Turned Into The Hunger Games Let's Talk About Google's Crazy Year In Hardware  Alex Cranz Apr 30, 2017, 9:00am ⋅ Filed to:  gadgets google google glass google pixel Share Google needs to be in the hardware business. It's infiltrated nearly all aspects of our lives to an alarming degree. It controls our emails through Gmail, knows where we go through Maps, has a list of every person we communicate with via Android, and understands our every interest thanks to its search engine and Chrome. Yet it's gonna hit a wall soon. A company as large as Google can't infiltrate every point of the human experience with software and services alone. It needs to be producing the phones we text on and the computers we browse on. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Last April it was reported that Google was aggressively hiring a hardware team in preparation for a big push, and sure enough, by the end of the year, the company had released a whole line of gadgets across categories ranging from smart phones to smart speakers. One year later, there have been some setbacks. On Thursday, David Foster, whom Google poached from Amazon to guide the development and release of the future Pixel phones, departed from the company. Foster's initial hiring appeared to be a big win for Google last year. He ran Lab126 at Amazon, the lab responsible for the Kindle, Fire, and Echo. Working under fellow poachee, Rick Osterloh (who was a big Motorola Mobility exec), Foster was going to take over the reins of the Pixel, a phone that was announced only a few days after his joining the team. But now Foster's gone. "It wasn't a good fit, or it wasn't what he was expecting," analyst Jan Dawson of Jackson Research told Gizmodo. According to Dawson, a departure only six months into Foster's tenure likely had little to do with the hardware he was developing at Google. "There's no obvious reason why he'd want to abandon ship." As Dawson told Gizmodo, the hardware Google's released thus far has been "well reviewed." With Google's I/O developer conference coming up next month, let's take a look back at that "well reviewed" Google hardware. Last year I/O was where Google announced both the Home and Daydream — two products that seemed like they could redefine their respective categories. And the products turned out well enough. But now that we've got a little distance for perspective, it's worth asking whether the year Google got serious about building its own hardware was actually good. Google Pixel Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo In the controlled settings of the Google Pixel launch, Google's first in-house phone seemed to be some kind of genius. Not just because it came in a vibrant blue version, but because Google Assistant, the company's answer to Siri, seemed to be genuinely smart. Then everyone got their hands on an actual Pixel and it was revealed to be a nice phone, but not the hype machine Google wanted and needed. (And Google Assistant was really, really stupid.) Now, six months later, we've all seen the Samsung Galaxy S8, and the Pixel feels more outdated than ever. Sure, the S8 shipped without its digital assistant intact, but its hardware is the best you can get. There's no phone with better specs or looks. The Pixel looks downright embarrassing beside it. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo It looks more like a rip-off of an old iPhone than like the first phone from one of the largest and most influential tech companies in the world. The next version of the Pixel will need to be more forward thinking. Unfortunately, the few rumours we've heard about the product suggest it will be chasing Samsung's glory by rocking a curved display. Come on Google, you can be more innovative than that! Google Wifi Image: Google Announced in October 2016, and available in December 2016, Google Wifi is a very nice little mesh router. For $US300 ($401), you get three, so you can place them all over your home to blanket it in wi-fi (a single router retails for $US129 ($172)). It's attractive, and pretty easy to set up, and if you've ever seen Eero, then you're going to scratch you head, because they're a lot alike. A Stupid Simple Router For Super Lazy People Wi-Fi routers suck. They're universally ugly and hard to use. But Eero's little internet pods are the opposite of that standard. While they may not be the very best in terms of performance, the Eero system fixes a lot of big problems that plague the wifi genre. Read more The two products neck and neck when you test them speed wise as well. They even have similar software. The only difference besides price (Eero is $US100 ($134) more)? Eero's been out since 2015. Google's first in-house router operates at the same level as a year-old crowdfunded device. Google Home Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo I really, really liked Google's answer to the Amazon Echo when it first came out. It's more attractive, has better audio, and ties into Google Music — my music player of choice. There's one by my bed that I try and use on a regular basis. I say try, because I am positive the Google Home has gotten stupider since it was released in November 2016. When you have smart devices like the Home or Echo, you learn to always enunciate clearly when speaking to them. I call it the "Echo voice." The Home often struggles to understand that. Sometimes I get exactly what I have requested. Other times it forgets that it can do something it did THE DAY BEFORE. I ask it the weather. "Sorry, I don't know how to do that yet." I ask it to turn off the lights. "Sorry, I don't know how to do that yet." I ask it to play some music to sleep to. "Sorry, I can't find your 'music to sleep to' playlist." The genius of the smart home has apparently been bumped in the noggin one too many times since purchase. But Google keeps promising the Home will get better, and it has actually added some new features. If you have a Chromecast or Android TV you can actually control it via voice — the 50-per cent of the time Home understands you. Google Chromecast Ultra Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo A bright point in a cloud of "eh" products. The Chromecast Ultra works great. But it is also just a regular Chromecast, now streaming in 4K. So it isn't any kind of game changer — certainly not like the original Chromecast. Google Daydream View Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo OK. This is actually an innovative product from Google. Its design, all soft like an old t-shirt, is infinitely better than the ugly plastic goggles everyone else makes, and its small controller, that neatly slots into the headset when neither is in use, is so smart Samsung went and copied it with the latest Gear VR. But if your biggest innovation in the hardware space comes from a mobile VR headset, you're not exactly doing great. People didn't see the Daydream View and say, "YES. I need to buy this immediately so I can watch videos in 360 on YouTube." They say, "Neat, I hope this gets cheap one day so I can buy one to shut the kids up on a road trip." With Foster gone, Google's got a chance to shift things around internally. And it needs to. Google IO is only a few weeks away. Last year, Google announced both the Home, and Daydream to wonderstruck its audience. This year, that audience will be much more savvy, and Google's going to need to have something extraordinary under the curtain. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Join the discussion!

It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting, in fact. Besides the intrigue of the mournful saga of Note7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn't just another smartphone -- this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void -- yikes! Why The Scariest Response To Climate Change Is Finally Being Taken Seriously Maddie Stone 28 Apr 2017 2:00 PM We aren't doing such a great job solving the whole climate change problem, which is why some experts think it's time to study more radical tactics. The notion of geoengineering -- hacking the climate to cool the planet -- is controversial, awe-inspiring and, to many, terrifying. And yet, despite their own grave concerns with the idea, a group of researchers believes the time has come to explore whether planet-hacking might really work. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | April 29, 2017 -- 22:47 GMT (15:47 PDT) | Topic: Mobility (Image: File photo) David Foster, VP of hardware product development at Google, has left the company six months after Google recruited him from Amazon. Foster was charged with leading development of Google's Pixel smartphone and Home speaker. He joined Google in the days surrounding the launch of the Pixel and Pixel XL in October 2016. Amidst a bigger hardware push from Google, Foster reported to Rick Osterloh, the former Motorola executive Google hired last year. At Amazon, Foster led development of the Echo smart speaker and Kindle tablets, and before that, worked at Apple and IBM for a short stint. A Google spokesperson confirmed Foster's departure, but declined to offer specifics. Google currently doesn't plan to replace Foster, according to Bloomberg. Bloomberg reported Google still plans to release at least two new Pixel models this fall. Osterloh is said to have previously hinted the Pixel lineup will be refreshed annually and stay premium. It's also rumored Google could launch a third Pixel and new Google Home speaker this year.

Julia LoveRishika Sadam Google’s revenue rose 22.2% to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended 31 March. Photo: Mint Bengaluru/San Francisco: Google parent Alphabet posted a surge in profit and revenue on Thursday as its core advertising business continued to grow at an extraordinary rate and problems such as an advertiser boycott of YouTube had little impact. Alphabet’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29% to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” Shares of the company rose 2.8% to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its arch-rival Facebook, Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99% of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. “It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6% share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6% in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. “Our great properties—like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play—are the ‘prime time’ for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested,” Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google’s revenue rose 22.2% to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended 31 March. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters. Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that “YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate,” dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. Cloud, hardware revenues soar Google’s non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.45 to $3.10 billion. Google has long trailed Amazon.com and Microsoft in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call. “We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business,” Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors’ concerns about Google’s dependence on search, Wang said. “We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company,” he said. “That is quite an impressive achievement.” On the other hand, Alphabet’s “Other Bets”—separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily—continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down.” Reuters Julia LoveRishika Sadam Topics: Google Alphabet Alphabet profit Ad sales Alphabet revenue More From Livemint READ MORE Niti Aayog for simultaneous Lok Sabha, assembly polls from 2024 Presidential polls 2017: Opposition candidate will unite parties against BJP, says Sharad Yadav India eyes all-electric car fleet by 2030, says Piyush Goyal First Published: Fri, Apr 28 2017. 09 47 AM IST Editor's Picks RBI’s Viral Acharya calls for reprivatization of nationalized banks Tata-Docomo case: Delhi HC rejects RBI plea, clears $1.17 billion arbitration award Examining the China-North Korea oil arrangement and how it may not last Latest News Niti Aayog for simultaneous Lok Sabha, assembly polls from 2024 Presidential polls 2017: Opposition candidate will unite parties against BJP, says Sharad Yadav India eyes all-electric car fleet by 2030, says Piyush Goyal Global pension funds scout for deals in India’s solar power sector Govt keen to push ahead with more PSB consolidation Mint On Sunday The private lives of Delhi’s LGBT youth Getting Justin Bieber to India is very, very hard work 2003 World Cup final: If only India had chosen to bat first...

In an earnings call with a Wall Street analyst, the company said this was by design and part of an effort to “take a long term view” of the platform, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai continued by noting that Maps is still seeing strong user growth years after its initial launch thanks to its growth in emerging markets. He also said that with the rise of augmented reality, it’s likely that Maps will soon play a bigger role in the company’s future strategy. The most interesting details gleaned from the investor call, however, relate to Google’s future monetization plans for Maps. “I’m sure you have noticed changes in Google Maps with the last few months. If you open Google Maps, you’re traveling or out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more info about what you can do, places to eat and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there overtime as well,” said Pichai. The key words in this quote are “good feedback” and “add value,” two of the overarching core values behind Google as a company. If Google thinks users like recommendations regarding nearby restaurants and attractions, Maps could adopt a similar monetization strategy to Waze, its other navigation app. It’s possible Pichai’s comments could pertain to another advertising or monetization strategy, though it’s unlikely the company will opt to display intrusive banner ads in Maps at any point in the near future.

Google confirmed the departure to Bloomberg, but declined to provide additional context. Prior to joining Google, Foster was an executive at Amazon’s Lab126 hardware division. While there, he played an instrumental role in the development of the Kindle, as well as the company’s Echo voice-activated speaker. Foster also had stints at Microsoft and Apple. It’s unclear what effect Foster’s departure will have on Google’s future hardware aspirations. Citing a “person familiar with the company’s plans, Bloomberg reports Google does not plan to fill Foster’s vacated role, at least not in the immediate future. Presumably, Rick Osterloh, the head of Google’s hardware division, will take on some of Foster’s previous duties. Recent rumours suggest Google plans to release three Pixel devices in 2017. In addition to updated versions of the Pixel and Pixel XL, the company is said to be working on Pixel-branded phablet-like smartphone or tablet device.

The football organization wants the search engine to take down Facebook's homepage, claiming that it distributes copyright infringing content. Google has investigated the unusual censorship effort and decided not to take any action in response. Removing search results is nothing new for Google. The company has been cleaning up its search index for years, in response to complaints from copyright holders. Every week the search engine processes millions of requests. In most cases these claims are legitimate, but every now and then innocent web pages are mistakenly targeted. This week we stumbled upon a takedown notice that’s clearly not right. The request was sent by NetResult on behalf of the Premier League, and targets a wide variety of sports streaming related sites. “The reported URLs are offering unauthored live streams of Premier League content,” it reads, listing the homepages of sites such as streamsarena.eu, letsfooty.com, tvlink.in and sportcategory.com. While targeting the homepages of these sites is already quite broad, it also lists the main Facebook.com URL among the infringing domains, asking Google to remove it from the search engine entirely. Premier League Takedown Notice Google has investigated the claims, including the Facebook one, but decided not to comply with the notice in question, leaving Facebook’s homepage in search results. In situations like this, we can see how easy erroneous takedown claims can easily lead to over-blocking. It’s good to know that, despite receiving millions of requests per day, the search engine is still able to spot most of these flaws. Unfortunately, however, not all mistakes are easily caught, especially when they concern smaller sites. Just a few days ago we noticed that a page from the copyright troll blog DieTrollDie was removed from Google’s search results because it mentioned a torrent hash of a Lionsgate film, and another blog had several court filings removed from the results for the same reason.

DZone's Guide to How Is The Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Changing? Due to an expanded threat landscape, and more sophisticated techniques, criminals make more money from the internet than anywhere else. by Tom Smith · Apr. 28, 17 · Security Zone Free Resource Like (0) Comment (0) Save Tweet {{ articles[0].views | formatCount}} Views Edit Delete {{ articles[0].isLocked ?

Join For Free Discover how to protect your applications from known and unknown vulnerabilities. When we asked 25 IT security executives this question we heard two themes: 1) the threat landscape is expanding exponentially; and, 2) more sophisticated hackers are making a lot of money. Expanded Threat Landscape 1) Politically motivated attacks. Cyber warfare is driving regime change. We’ve moved from weapons to cyber warfare. 2) Ransomware. 3) IoT (e.g., Dyn attack). People don’t worry enough about security and end up keeping things on default values. Mobile is the most vulnerable because there’s no news about hacks; however, they are taking place. IoT and mobile will shift to cybercrime with ransomware on refrigerators. Need to test for mobile and IoT vulnerabilities. There will be watershed events on both in the coming year with ransomware being the big issue. IoT devices. Vendors are still deploying products with default passwords or vulnerabilities. Advanced phishing techniques download malicious apps. Google began rejecting all Symantec SSL certificates. Shift toward DevOps, Cloud, Mobile has changed how we monitor and respond. There are fewer system administrators and more software developers. This impacts the skillset of what’s needed. Criminals are opportunistic and will find the low hanging fruit. All the places where software is now that it didn’t used to be – smartphones and IoT devices as opposed to just websites, browsers, and operating systems. You need a strategy for servicing and patching bugs in the wild. Encrypt data in transit. We have webcams with default passwords and backdoors left in by intention or ignorance. Changes in the processing landscape have given hackers access to thousands of cores to conduct brute-force attacks. State actors are listening to everything. 15 years ago we worried about credit card data. Today it’s heart monitors, data streams of locations, and biometrics. The rise in the number of IoT devices has led to a more relaxed atmosphere with regards to secure coding. Companies want to get the devices out the door at a low cost, with a low coding expense. This results in using insecure coding calls that don’t track user bounds and leads to buffer overflows – a problem that was solved years ago. A lot of firmware development is being done overseas by self-taught developers that don’t emphasize security. Companies will take for granted that what they get is secure instead of checking the firmware for security once it’s in house. You can use Veracode or HP Verify; however, how do you know there are no vulnerabilities when you combine them with third-party applications and device drivers? You need to check the security of your devices after the compilation process. More cloud, IoT, open source, and open stack that lack security controls. Without standards or controls to rely on, there’s an increased risk of adoption. We are also dealing with shared security on clouds. Prevention, detection, and response alone are not enough. You need to worry about all three. You need to prevent hackers from coming back. There needs to be more sharing and automation for threat hunting so you can respond to modern hackers. A lot of attention is being paid to attribution, ransomware, compromise attacks, and IoT attacks. These are challenging operational capabilities since we’ll have 40 billion devices by 2020. We lack the talent and the capability to prevent breaches today. The biggest challenge is educating those who are not educated – people who don’t know what they don’t know and aren’t interested in learning. We expect vendors to take care of the security of the devices they’re selling us but they’re not. In the transportation (automobile) industry, three of four vendors are providing a key component with security controls; however, these controls are not being implemented during installation the way they were intended due to lack of CPU power or lack of LAN access. Taking old technology and bolting it on to new technology just opens us up to DDOS attacks that could stop all transportation the way BART was stopped. Tracks and trains can be hacked. Filters on flash and macros in Office 365 can be overridden and this can lead to significant unintended consequences. How do we see and act on these unintended consequences? The advent of cloud access security or cloud security as a service. More companies are using the cloud with Microsoft Office and Google’s G-Suite. We extend threat protection to the cloud including sandboxes and DLP. From attacks on endpoints to attacks on servers. In banking, we used to worry about malware and Trojan horses targeting PCs and mobile devices. Now hackers are attacking the core enterprise systems, including the ERP. They’ve moved from stealing credit card data to more valuable information like healthcare data. IoT devices are not being patched. Already in support and more are coming out. It's a very human-intensive process. And it's hard to sell people on patching webcams or refrigerators that need to run software updates. We need the ability to automatically update the firmware. Develop the strategy when supporting any device. Companies have been developing and deploying more and more apps to the cloud in the last two to three years providing new risks and new risk vectors. Security has been around for 20 years but app and IoT developers fail to follow best practices. It’s a mess that’s going to get worse. In the development and operations world, change is needed in application security. Application security is not keeping up with CI/CD. We have the same issues as we’ve had for the past 10 years – SQL injections and cross-eyed scripting continue to be big issues. There has not been a lot of innovation. We need new strategies with CI/CD to integrate security tools into CI. Perimeter defense is gone in light of mobile phones, web cameras, the internet, and Ethernet. Now you must complement the traditional perimeter defense. Design to be cloud-based first. You must be able to detect movement in space. IoT must be hardened – the security of the device and the gateway. 1) For the modern-day CISO, the proliferation of cloud-based mobile apps has dramatically increased the exposed surface area of the business. Each new app requires and enables access to organizational data and assets, and unless the security team was explicitly involved in the app’s creation, acquisition, and delivery, users inside and outside the organization may have access to data and the ability to expose it without the CISO even being aware. 2) This challenge of visibility is compounded by the lack of standards by which organizational data and assets are shared and exposed. Different business units may adopt their own approach to security, or perhaps not take one at all, making the CISO’s job of propagating security best practices unwieldy. The landscape has been changing for a while. We are seeing most attacks residing on the application level. The reasons are clear: peripheral security such as network security is already a commodity and hackers don’t need to struggle avoiding firewalls and IPS systems when they have applications that are a direct communication channel to the enterprise data. The same goes for endpoint protection; exploiting vulnerabilities in web and mobile applications is much less time consuming and achieves better and faster results. Therefore, the change we are seeing is that the hackers have figured out the code to be a weak spot in many cases because developers rarely have the skills or the proper tools to identify when they expose a vulnerability in the code. More Sophisticated Hackers The threat space has changed – there are new groups and new tools. The tech space has also changed with mobile and IoT. New monetization techniques like ransomware. Liquid, easy to use currency like bitcoin has enabled a new marketplace of tools to come into the market the last two years. While black hats still go after individual users, they’re more likely to go after big money from larger organizations like hospitals, governments, and businesses, including law firms. A lot of attacks are taking place and payments being made with no reports since they are not required. It’s hard to know what’s really going on. Companies are making six figure settlements without reporting the breach because they don’t want their image tarnished. Most of these are endpoint and application security vulnerabilities. Based on a study from Accenture, 70% of threats are from internal sources (i.e., disgruntled employees). Cyber threats have become more organized whether they’re corporate espionage or state-sponsored threats. Attacks are more sophisticated. According to an Intel study, there’s been a 170% increase in ransomware with malicious code put on the database. There has also been a growth in advanced persistent threats. Hackers quietly siphon passwords and encryption keys maintaining a low profile with no indications of compromise. This type of activity is harder to detect. No network is 100% impenetrable. It helps to track behavior and correlate it versus threat data to proactively shut down the attack before significant damage is done. Also, make sure to profile and identify suspicious behaviors and shut them down. Nation-state attacks used to be the most sophisticated. Today, even middle of the road hackers are sophisticated. We’ve become more aware of zero-days on shelf malware ready to hit. We’re much more responsive than we used to be. More sophisticated attacks are happening daily. Healthcare and retail are particularly scary. Threats are multifaceted using well-known infrastructures. Social engineering. Most sophisticated use platforms like Dropbox, HubSpot, and other distributed techniques that are freely available. Slower cooker payload may be delivered in 50 days. Temporal difference across different application platforms (i.e., Twitter, Box, Drobox) much more complicated. Command and transport. Layer of obfuscation – not a blacklisted domain payload delivered to a CRM used as a proxy to another infrastructure. This is very complex. Hackers are targeting large corporations. Hackers are more sophisticated. Larger organizations have so many points of entry that are not closed. A directory with an org chart opens a company for social engineering attacks. Everything is becoming more connected – BYOD, laptops, mobile connecting to Wi-Fi. We see criminals making more money from the internet than any other area. Ransomware attacks on banks. The internet can generate more money. I expect this to continue and grow. Customers are more computerized. The manufacturing supply and demand chains are all connected. Vulnerabilities will increase. Organizations need to ramp up cyber security capabilities. Attackers are using second vectors to attack the target using social engineering. There are more distributed, scalable attacks with cloud and containers. Cybersecurity threats are distributed. There is no longer a known signature. Indicators of compromise and attack are distributed. How attack patterns change, shift from tools, gain access to reconnaissance. Leverage attributes of the environment to take advantage of them.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 67 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares166 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon.

They respond within moments, but that response is always boilerplate like you mentioned. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Charles222 I usually roll with Google auto-creating events in calendar for me like they do, and the random stuff that doesn't float through my email goes to Todoist. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Charles222 Having a few Homes around the house is what pushed it for me. I'll remember some random-ass thing I need to do in the future, and I don't take my phone to bed (or have it particularly nearby generally at home) as a rule...but I do have a Home in the bedroom and just being able to talk to to Todoist to set up an event is fantastic. Scott Scrivens That sounds pretty great. If I get Home I'll definitely check it out. Also "Homes around the house" sounds funny. Maybe Google didn't think the name through. Charles222 haha, yeah, I suppose it does. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. bekifft Pretty sure that one was for example, I doubt his dog's name is actually Fido. I admit it is kind of unlikely you'd get that many reminders in one notification, but it does illustrate the point that Google hasn't quite thought the system through. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v bekifft This happens to me too. Not so extreme, but it seemingly sometimes takes Google quite a while to realize I'm home for reminders. Which is strange because they bloody well know that I'm home, they spend all day burning through my battery to make sure they know where I am at all times. Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. leganzish I have always wanted this for those exact same scenarios. That would be so powerful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Scott Scrivens I have tried Tick-Tick actually, and I seem to remember not liking the UX. It's seems it's had a considerable makeover since then though so I'll check it out again, cheers. Jock Murray I use Business Tasks by Appgenix-software.com I don't think Google realise the importance of their Google Tasks. The ability to nest tasks and have descriptions/comments attached to each task, is critical. Keep users don't know what they're missing out on. Scott Scrivens Looks good, I'll check it out! pantagruel I use Business Calendar 2 with support for Google Tasks built in. Smarter choice if you use your calendar as well. bekifft Since we're recommending apps, this one seems the best, and uses Google Tasks as its back end. Come to think of it, I'm not sure Google Tasks even has an official front end anymore, but Google seems to have forgotten to shut it down. Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splendapps.splendo Scott Scrivens Think I've tried this one before and wasn't overly enamored by the UX, sadly. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 Rafael Reinoldes But it can't handle nested itens :( N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. morrisp Well, it won't appear (or notify you) on the desktop Calendar -- but will still notify you in the Calendar app, yes? N8SLC Yes, morrisp. :) Scott Scrivens Nope. It straight up won't give you a notification at all. It acts as though reminders are turned off altogether. If you set the reminder in another app, those will still notify you. But if you set the reminder in Calendar (app or desktop), and turn the reminder calendar off, you won't get a notification. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. F4LL0U7 If you're talking about reminders set through the Google app, you have to go into the Google app's settings and enable sound & vibration for those notifications. I think they're off by default. ellett Nope, I don't use reminders through the Google app. I do all of my calendar-related operations through Calendar. Putting appointments, reminders, notifications and alarms in different places is just plain wrong. F4LL0U7 Ha, you have a point. It might seem obvious, but you just might want to check and make sure the notification sound is enabled in Calendar also. I think that one might be off by default too. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. iCON You are talking about a company that has six different messengers... Scott Scrivens I'd say it's more about whether it's profitable, rather than whether it's possible. Sad truth. F4LL0U7 There was a recent article on AP (I forget who wrote it) about Google's messenger strategy (or lack thereof) that seemed pretty spot-on. I would bet their reminder strategy is pretty similar. bekifft That, and I don't think they've had a clear reminders strategy from the beginning, and probably still don't. With reminders tied into all these services, it's probably an engineering nightmare at this point. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Naxx ENVY ^ this , his phones on like 5% , hes like . i forgot something , let me check my list ... oh right yea charge phone . Scott Scrivens Because the battery on my Nexus 5X doesn't last the whole day. So a reminder to charge it at around 4PM is useful. I'm not always able to, but if I intend to be out of the house in the evening it's a necessity unfortunately 😩 Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different Scott Scrivens Agree with Luzandro. It's probably the best option but still not as good as the Google app input method. bekifft Yes and ironically the Google app does not yet have any app shortcuts. Add Reminder and View Reminders would be two excellent choices. TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. morrisp The stock iOS Reminders app is indeed buggy -- notifications sometimes don't go off. It's a big problem! I recently switched to using an app called MinimaList for most of my reminders. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like. Scott Scrivens You're right about this, and it does work well enough. I just wish Inbox reminder notifications wouldn't disappear after a random amount of time. Miguel Hernandez I know this may sound blasphemous to some in this community but how about Cortana? It has a widget that show upcoming reminders and easy add reminder button and is cross-device with Windows 10. Antonio Gabbiano Exactly the same thoughts that I have. The fastest way to add a reminder is via shortcut for Inbox. Hanny Yeung Google Reminder as a new separate app in 3...2...1... Btw, I use Loop for my recurring reminders. Good design & usability, plus I can track my habit performance (I saw Vitamins in your calendar and that seems to be a suitable entry for Loop). Everything else are occasional, so they're in Google, created by voice command. Agreed an app shortcut from Google app and a separation of each reminder in notifications would make life easier. Vivek Shah I completely agree with Scott. The reminder options in Google Calendar desperately needs a overhaul. Hope they're reading this. Polyterative Calendar is great but abbandoned by google.. I'm a power user and these annoyances are really bad bekifft I wouldn't say it's abandoned but it's definitely not a core product anymore. They made it to compete with Microsoft and Exchange back in the day, and it was effective at that, but that's not what they care about anymore. So actually yeah, I can see how it is kind of abandoned. _jack_ Tbh, that's why I use another app for reminders and to-dos. I hate this inconsistencies, and a dedicated service for reminders isn't a bad idea (especially when using them extensively). makapav Not to mention there is no option to make the reminder notification more aggressive: intensity, repeat, persistence. vodanium I really miss that, too! Sometimes I want a reminder to really grasp my attention to do the task at the very moment. In other cases, though, it is not an issue to miss the notification for a few minutes/hours - most of the to-do activities are like this. I've been using The Clock app for "hard" notifications, but it is far from being ideal: e.g. it can be used for reminders within one week only, no option for sophisticated recurrences (e.g. bi-weekly), etc. makapav In other words - it's a usability clusterfuck. fnquaso Actually, Google Tasks does have a (hidden) webpage: https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas bekifft I've started using this app specifically for recurring reminders. Not sure whether it's a good thing or bad thing that Google leaves these gaping holes to third party providers, but here check it out: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bleyl.recurrence&hl=en Rafael Reinoldes Not to mention their task management system, We can create a task list in keep, export it to docs and suddenly they were not tasks anymore, while gmail still have a half-baked task functionality that doesn't support remainders, but supports nested items!! Rafael Reinoldes Forgot about the inability to import lists from docs to keep again Rafael Reinoldes Did you said 'chrome'?!? How could anyone set a remainder from chrome? Scott Scrivens Search "add reminder" in Google. As long as you're signed into your Google account you'll get this... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b7f84553cb8c9298712a98dc6a5f355c79fb13f00154d89a39eaa785046cdab9.png Rafael Reinoldes Not working here, even in an anonymous tab, probably only available in US, tested in android and desktop from Brazil. Scott Scrivens Interesting. I'm in the UK and it works for me. Maybe not everywhere though. Sorry to get your hopes up. You are signed into Google right? Rafael Reinoldes I am logged into google, mainly, because I get a lot of value by syncing stuff across different computers. Scott Scrivens That's annoying, not sure why it wouldn't work in Brazil :( Nathan Type "add reminder" in the Chrome address box. I do it all the time on my PC because it is faster than picking up my phone, but I was also experiencing problems with notifications for reminders set in Chrome not appearing on any of my devices. Now I know why. Rodrigo Chiong It's true that the reminders situation a mess. But I do see a launcher shortcut to add reminders from Inbox that work alright. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dc3b51117bfc2b134dc2fdf28b442f4389a3730166e304ee5ae2969fbe776d83.png Scott Scrivens This is true, and it does work pretty well. The only issue is that, as others have pointed out, Inbox reminder notifications seem to disappear after a little while. I like to leave my reminder notifications in the shade until I get to them. Rodrigo Chiong Well that's also true. You never know if the notification will come from Calendar, Keep, Inbox or the Google app and they all behave differently (particularly the snooze feature) KB You don't need "add reminder" in the search box, just typing "reminder" is sufficient. Dan While adding a reminder in chrome only allows times in 30 minute increments, there is a workaround for at least this part: include the specific time (and optionally the actual reminder text itself) in your 'add reminder' search: 'add reminder 7:40pm' will pre-fill the time for you (although changing the time will still only allow the 30 minute incremented time values) or just search the entire reminder: 'add reminder take out the trash at 7:40pm' or 'remind me to take out the trash at 7:40pm' hopefully this helps someone else Scott Scrivens Great find. As a way of crowdsourcing fixes this is proving very worthwhile. Chris Sanner lessee....what else about reminders bugs me - 1) if you want to dismiss a recurring notification early one dya your only option is to dismiss it *forever* 2) no "repeat x time after completion" option. this is the thing that most keeps me on other todo apps. I might not replace my furnace filter ON THE DAY it's due - but I want to be reminded again a month after I *DO* replace and dismiss it. Joe Dink AMEN! So true! It's pathetic. On such a good platform, otherwise. Chris I agree the reminder system has some shortcomings. I was frustrated recently when the assistant had all but removed entering a reminder by typing if you're in a situation where you can't use your voice. So, I wrote this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccwilcox.quickreminders Its shortcuts to create Google reminders. I depend on reminders, as well Scott Scrivens That looks really useful. Incompatible with my 5X though sadly... Chris Not compatible with the 5X? I'll look into that asap and fix that... Scott Scrivens Let me know when you do, I'll give it a whirl. Chris What country are you in? Are you in the US? Currently, I have the Play Store distribution set to US only for compatibility with Google's app service Scott Scrivens Ah, that's why...I'm in the UK. Are you able to expand the distribution to here? Chris I've enabled the UK and Canada along with the US. Let me know if it works! It may have quirks but lets see! Scott Scrivens Just had a quick play with it, it's really cool! Things I would change/add (if you care to hear them): 1. Blue instead of green (I just hate lime green personally, it reminds me of too much of pre-Holo Android). Add a custom themer even if that's not loads of work. 2. Simple "Add reminder" option, without a predefined time. 3. Hitting X should close app altogether rather than just minimise. Add settings to the top of the expanded options rather than floating at the bottom. 4. Move "Remove ads option" further up out of the way. It's too prominent. 5. Key not available in my country, so add UK and Canada to that too! Those are just my two-pence, though I realise it's all subjective :) Chris Thank you for the feedback! I began building a theme option to set different colors. Many people would probably like that. I'll be happy to credit you on the app page when I post the next update. Scott Scrivens Thanks, that would be an honour. Always happy to play around with new apps. Let me know when you update. F4LL0U7 I recently got Android Wear 2.0 on my GWR, and noticed that I don't even receive reminders on there anymore! I set all my reminders through Google Now, and last night I got a monthly reminder at 9pm on my phone. Nothing at all showed up on my watch. I navigated to the Reminders app on my watch, and the recurring reminder was in the list, but it showed zero current reminders. WTF! Seems like this might be a leftover bug from AW 1.x, where I would receive reminders right on time on my watch, but they were not actionable. If I tried marking one as done, it would think for a few seconds, and then I'd get the frowning cloud icon saying I wasn't connected. But I WAS connected, damn you Google! Josh A The app shortcuts u said Google should add on the home screen can be added to the home screen by holding on the icon again. For example, look at the pic added https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ae1ec39a9aa7517f5e7184c8e8332418e71499a85ea1c56450445ad292f0ba61.png Scott Scrivens What I said is that the Google app should implement similar app shortcuts. Patrick O’Hara To me, the issue isn't getting reminders into the device. The issue is that there is only 1 type of reminder and it's easy to miss. There should be multiple reminder types. Silent, visual, audible, and urgent, for example. I've set lots of reminders that I never got because my volume was turned down. myssi GIVE ME REMINDER WITH DURATION!! Trip66 To find all your reminders all you have to do is say Okay Google show me my reminders and scroll the list the most recent ones are usually on top I've never had any problems finding them. Devin Quesenberry Scott, hang in there pal. You're not alone in your struggle. I've been trying to find a digital solution for my non-scheduling mind since the Trapper Keeper days. Some days I still have to carry around pen and paper, but I'm grateful for google reminders nonetheless. When Inbox came out I signed up because I liked the idea of merging my to-do list with my email (I wish Google would capitalize on this more, but it seems to me that they are starting to take the shotgun approach to development in general). However, I still find myself needing other apps like Keep and Onenote to get the job done. Reminders help me compartmentalize the many hats I have to wear between work, home, and volunteer life, so DO NOT APOLOGIZE for having reminders to do basic things like charge your phone, use the bathroom, or bathe every once in awhile. I even have reminders to check in on my mom from time to time (i.e. reminders to be a decent human being). Loved this article. Fong Yang I'm also a heavy user of reminders and I see the same problems. I hope Google fixes this soon. bekifft You're not alone, I would have written almost exactly this article if I could find the words. I've come to most of the same conclusions you have. Keep is by far the best way to handle reminders through Google, as it's the only one that lets you specify an arbitrary location at which to be reminded. The reason reminders haven't been added to Google Home yet is likely precisely because of this mess. God only knows what it looks like on the back end. Andrey Balandin You're very right in pointing out these deficiencies and I totally support that the experience is inconsistent. However, to be fair you are not using the right view in the calendar for your purposes. There is value in having one app which can show you all of the reminders created by all different methods together with other events and calendar is a good place for this, isn't it? To avoid this cluttered look which makes the calendar unusable you should just switch to schedule view. Scott Scrivens But the month view is how I use Calendar. I like to have an overview of my activity for the whole month. I don't think I should have to change my behaviour because Google is unwilling to hide upcoming recurring tasks in Calendar. YuCMi You forget that Google's business strategy is to have clones of each of their products. Rob It's worth adding that you can only add a reminder using the Google app if you have Google Now cards activated (I don't, because I find it otherwise useless).

How selfies can build – and destabilise – brands  Joonas Rokka WEEKEND REVIEW Sunday April 30, 2017 Share Play NBR radio on While self-portraiture is nearly as old as art itself, the photographic selfie emerged as a globally recognised phenomenon only recently, as a result of the rising “attention economy” and its growing appetite for likes, followers, retweets and fame. Google estimates some 24 billion selfies were taken in a year via 200 million Google accounts alone, which signals that the phenomenon far from being marginal. Selfies can be taken by virtually anyone, and companies and brands have recognised the magnetic “power” in making a selfie a key element of marketing campaigns and social-media content strategies. Yet brands are increasingly aware – and often uncomfortably so – that individuals’ selfies constitute a whole new form of brand co-creation. Based on my research, I will examine how people use “brand selfies” to express their identities as complex assemblages of things, objects, and brands and how that engenders new challenges for branding. Selfies and self-portraiture in historical perspective The selfie phenomenon has important connections with the idea of self-portraits in fine arts that emerged in the 16th Century. Already classic works of artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt, for example, featured paintings, engravings and drawings of the artist face-to-face with the spectator. These images often featured the artist “in action” in the artist’s studio, usually holding the pencils, brushes and colour palette in hand, in order to give the impression that the image was spontaneous and authentic in nature. But it was also not uncommon to these early self-portraits that the artist posed in fine clothing and staged apparel, or that he was playfully engaging with various image genres of the time. For instance, self-portraits were often fused with historical scenes or even still-life images. The self-portrait shares much in common with the visual genre called “snapshot aesthetic”, commonly in use in photography and commercial images, and not least in ads. Snapshot relies on the authentic feeling of images snapped “on the go” of our daily lives. As described by Iqani and Schroeder (2015), these casual, everyday images helps us narrate and make sense of our selves but also communicate our existence to those around us. When examined in the light of broader history of self-portraiture and photography it becomes quickly clear that classifying and pathologising selfies as simple acts of narcissism and ego-play would overlook important critical commentaries and reflexivity that this visual form potentially offers. Notably, many famous self-portraits have sought out for representational agency in order to make visible issues related to power and politics, including gender, as explained by art historian Derek Murray (2015). Yet it is important to keep in mind that the self-portrait and selfie differ in several respects. For one, self-portraits were historically rare and usually produced by the elite and the celebrated. It was not until the boom of popular photography around the turn of 20th Century that it was democratised as a key genre of image making. And it was the rise of smartphones and easy online access that made selfie an everyday and ever-present spectacle and practice. Selfies and the rise of attention economy The emergence of selfie phenomenon can be partly explained by peoples’ increasingly important drive for attentional capital in the forms of quantifiable likes, shares and followers. The selfie is a symptom of the attention economy, as it draws on intimate and sometimes revealing images in a magnet-like manner. As a result, “instafame” has allured celebrities and stars, rappers and gangsters, presidents and popes to take selfies, but they are not reserved just for the elite. More than 296,417,695 images have been tagged in Instagram alone, when writing this article, suggesting that selfies can be found in just about everyone’s social media profiles. Research by Eagar and Dann (2016) identifies selfies as an important “self-branding” practice. They also point out various kinds of popular selfies that proliferate quickly, including autobiography, parody, propaganda, romance, self-help, travel, and the coffee-table-and-book selfies. Other ubiquitous trends include selfies at the gym, toilet, funeral, museum, swimming pool, in front of mirror, or alongside luxury or other objects, or while wearing a hijab – and with or without a selfie-stick. Yet emerging research has found that selfies are not only the product of narcissism but they also may entail a feeling of being in control of one’s own expression as well as empowerment. Selfies have been considered as potent ways for negotiating one’s identity-related tensions, such those related to body ideals, gender, ethnicity, sexuality or religion – or even ways to combat censorship in countries with limited freedom of speech. Selfies have also been recognised as a powerful cultural form because of their ability to transcend linguistic and cultural boundaries. Brand selfies and consumer microcelebrity New digital technologies are evidently changing the ways in which meanings and identity of both consumers and brands are constructed. This is why, in my ongoing research on champagne, I decided to study how consumers post selfies featuring some of the most popular champagne brands. By means of visual analysis of consumer-made selfies on champagne brand Instagram accounts, I was able to uncover some key dynamics that explain how the brand selfies impact and potentially contest even well-established brands, such as Moët & Chandon, Dom Pérignon, or Veuve Clicquot, the three most talked-about champagne brands online in my data. A total of 6,820 images were gathered during six weeks in April/May 2014, from which a random sample of 120 images were analysed in detail. The objective was to compare how brand account images differ from consumer-made selfie-images, which constituted as much as 40% of all brand-tagged images, to illuminate their distinct nature. It became quickly clear that the studied brand-controlled accounts did not use selfies in their visual communications, and even the presence of people (only 25% of images on average) or faces (13%) was rare. Instead, the brands’ postings often echoed typical champagne advertising images depicting a “still life” of inanimate objects, artefacts and scenery mainly focused on the product close-up – including the brand logo (75%), bottle(s) (63%), wine (25%), and bubbles (13%). They also ensured, as one might imagine, that no other brands were present or identifiable. All attention was reserved for the focal champagne brand and its principal, historically shaped associations that most often included “heritage/tradition” (55%), “class/status” (45%), and even “magic” (22%) (see figure 1). Figure 1: Champagne brands expressed in Instagram brand accounts. Maria Federley Consumers’ brand selfies presented sharp and visible contrast to these “official” brand images. While the appearance of bottles, wine and bubbles in selfie-images was as frequent as in the brand images, they presented a large number of human bodies (95% of selfie images and 1.5 people per image on average), with as many as 53% of the images featuring face(s). This shift in focus impacts the overall feeling of the images in significant ways. Notably, the presence of human bodies and identifiable faces break the brand’s singularity and gives it an often banalized expression. In addition, consumers’ brand selfies were not focused on a single champagne brand, but nearly 40% of the images contained or tagged several brands at once. Instead of being focused on the brand, the selfies were systematically centred on the “self”, making the brand necessarily more peripheral (see Figure 2). More often than not, the brand was only mentioned with a hashtag in textual commentary but not visible in the image. Figure 2: Brand selfies of various kinds. Maria Federley What emerges from the consumers’ brand selfies is an incontestable expression of what I call “microcelebrity”. This highly popular category, constituting 67% of all the consumer-made images, can be understood as a collection of visual practices and strategies that mimic celebrities’ postings aimed to signal fame and attractiveness to others. For example, common brand selfies entail “mirror selfies”, “gym selfies”, “bathroom selfies”, “bikini selfies”, and “party selfies”, in other words, “ordinary” people posing as if they were famous stars. These postings commonly joined with follower and attention-seeking hashtags such as #follow4follow", #followme, #like4like and #pickoftheday (see Figure 3). Figure 3: Brand selfies and consumer celebrities. Maria Federley Above all, these findings reveal that selfies as a new form of visual self-presentation practice have come to offer alternative constructions of brands with new kinds of material and expressive features. Notably, they indicate that selfies (and the self) are becoming the nodal point at which official brand images and consumer microcelebrity assemblages intersect. This powerful shift potentially undermines stable, historically built symbolic and material properties of heritage brands, and makes visible a profound heterogeneity of alternative and often chaotic brand images – at least from the point of view of the brand manager. New challenges for branding Companies and marketing scholars have long understood that social media have accelerated processes of brand co-creation with customers. Yet very often this phenomenon has been considered only in terms of online consumer-to-brand or consumer-to-consumer verbal dialogues or narratives – hence, word-of-mouth – leaving the visual aspects aside. New forms of visual practices, including the selfie, force the marketers to see and re-consider the visual dimension of their co-creation strategies. The problem is that until recently, most social-media monitoring tools base their analysis on text, not images or video. We thus seem to lack comprehensive tools and even vocabulary for addressing the arguably slippery, elusive but also excessive and voluminous visual. This makes the brand managers’ tasks increasingly difficult. Although experienced marketing professionals may have an intuitive understanding towards the visual, in my research I have hoped to offer more concrete approaches in this regard. Through visual content analysis of both official and consumer-made champagne Instagram images, I worked to understand the kinds of expressive and material assemblages of identities that the social media images construct. This allowed us to map out the focal elements that consumer-generated images – although most often arguably unintentionally – reinforce in the official brand expressions and meanings, and also those that effectively disrupt and destabilise them. For example, it was not uncommon that the studied official champagne brand accounts, and perhaps by accident, expressed symbolic and material elements in their postings that were largely in contradiction and dissonance, at least in terms of stylistic consistency, with their historically stabilized brand vision (for example, postings with “wrong” kinds of champagne glasses, or combining champagne with “wrong” kinds of subcultural symbols). How can companies manage brand co-creation through selfies? Despite the above-described challenges, I believe that powerfully resonant, charismatic, and meaningful brands can always play an important role in leading the creative production of social-media images and interactions. On a practical level, this could simply mean campaigns where brands teach people to take “desired” types of images with the “right” types of expressive and material ingredients. However, the question at stake is more fundamental: a contemporary brand can no longer rely on strategies that follow a logic that aims to “control” and “own” every association and aspect about their brand. Instead, they need to embrace a whole new conception of a brand which is more “open source” by default. This means that successful brands need to allow for more diversity and flexibility in the expressions and meanings that “fit” it. An excellent example is the GoPro brand that relies exclusively on consumer-created visual communications across all of their (official) communications. In a similar manner, successful brands will need to relinquish control – at least in a much greater degree – to gain resonance with the selfie-obsessed social media world.

But this VTOL likes to tag along the “flying car” moniker despite being a water-borne aircraft only. Silicon Valley’s Kitty Hawk Flyer This VTOL differs from the others we’ve covered on CleanTechnica. Although Kitty Hawk considers itself to be a “flying car” company, this VTOL is less flying car, more human-sized drone shaped for water use only. We already reported on Google’s Larry Page backing this rotor-based flying car, as well as Zee.Aero. This electric personal flying aircraft is simply called the Kitty Hawk Flyer. The good news is that it’s rated as an ultralight aircraft by the FAA (FAR 103 Ultralight Category), meaning no pilot license is required to operate it. Sitting on top of two generous cigar-shaped pontoons, much like water-landing helicopters use, the Kitty Hawk uses two rotors on all four sides of the aircraft, with a total of eight. Using the same design as modern drones, think of the Kitty Hawk Flyer one as a personal aircraft, where the pilot sits on top of it using a joystick to operate its flight maneuvers. But sitting on top of a drone also means sitting on top of propellers, not a particularly reassuring idea. So the Kitty Hawk Flyer has a net over the propellers, should you topple. Technically Speaking, The Kitty Hawk Flyer There isn’t a whole lot of information yet on the Kitty Hawk Flyer. It uses an eight-rotor configuration and can be operated without a pilot’s license, but for recreational purposes and water use only. So, no city flying — sorry folks. I can see problems with personal water jet craft, Seadoos, and Waverunners will begin soon enough. The Flyer can reach speeds of up to 25 mph (40 km/h) and … that’s it. The Kitty Hawk Flyer Price Although the Kitty Hawk hasn’t finalized a price yet, the company came up with a creative $100 three-year membership idea. What this does is that it gives you a priority on the waiting list, company gear, flight simulator, as well as other invitations to various events. Perhaps best of all, it gives you a $2,000 discount off the final price. We assume this probably places this Kitty Hawk Flyer at around $5,000 to $10,000, ideally. If you live outside the US, Kitty Hawk says there are no plans to ship the vehicle outside the US. Sorry, Canada. However, rejoice if you live here, as commercial production is expected by the end of this year (2017). Final Thoughts On The Kitty Hawk Flyer The video above is much more polished than a rough test flight, but it gives us an overall idea of what to expect from the Kitty Hawk Flyer. The company says that the final look will be different than what was shown here with a different design. Personally, I feel it’s a good start to gear the Kitty Hawk Flyer towards the recreation industry until it can hopefully develop enough to take us over land and ideally in a more urban setting.

Graphic of the Day (above) was inspired by a graphic that appeared today in the online version of the Wall Street Journal article “Uber Interviews Heavyweights for a Crucial Job: Handling Travis Kalanick” (graphics didn’t appear in the print edition). The WSJ graphic compared sales revenue during the seventh full calendar year of operations for Uber ($6.5 billion in 2016), Google ($6.1 billion in 2005), Facebook ($3.7 billion in 2011) and Amazon ($3.1 billion in 2001). Those figures aren’t adjusted for inflation, so based on a suggestion from Morganovich, the graphic above shows inflation-adjusted data for the four companies featured by the WSJ, along with some additions: Microsoft, Walmart, Netflix, Home Depot and Apple. Adjusted now for inflation, Uber’s revenues in its seventh year are more than $1 billion lower than Google’s. Main Point: In today’s highly globalized and digitized economy, it’s much easier to grow rapidly from a small base now than it ever was before, and Uber is the most recent and best example of that phenomena. Uber’s revenues in its seventh year of operation in 2016 of $6.5 billion are more than 46 times greater than Walmart’s sales in its seventh year of $141 million (in 2016 dollars). Of course, Walmart was operating brick-and-mortar stores in only four states in its seventh year in 1969, and Uber is a digital-based mobile app transportation company operating now in almost 600 cities worldwide. Just another perspective on how much and how fast things have changed in recent years….. and another example of why it’s such an exciting time to be alive…. HTs: Olivier Ballou for graphical assistance and Morganovich for the idea. 2. Venn Diagram of the Day (above). To help make American businesses more competitive, grow the economy, and create jobs, does President Trump think it’s best to raise or lower taxes on businesses? He seems to feel strongly both ways….. (Remember that “tariffs” and just another word for “taxes” on imported inputs for American businesses.) Related: The WSJ editorial board asks a great question today: “Does Trump know that Mexican tariffs on U.S. goods are close to zero?” Probably not, because the protectionist-in-chief has referred to Nafta as “the worst trade deal in the history of the world,” and keeps threatening to scrap Nafta or renegotiate it to get a “better deal.” But as the WSJ points out “it isn’t clear there’s much better to get. Mexican tariffs on imports of U.S. agricultural products, and most other goods, are nearly zero.” =================================== 3. The Two Most Misunderstood and Misused Economic Terms? In my opinion, it has to be the terms: a) “trade deficit” and b) “trade imbalance,” because those two terms are almost always used to imply incorrectly something negative about the US economy, when in fact there really are no trade “deficits” or “imbalances” once we account for all international transactions for goods, services and financial assets (see chart above). Formula: Current Account + Capital Account = 0 = Balance of Payments. Therefore, whenever you hear somebody talk about the trade deficit or a trade imbalance, it’s almost guaranteed that you’ll hear nothing about the foreign investment inflow that offsets any current account deficit, or the fact that international trade always balances. Part of the problem is that the term “deficit” automatically implies something negative and “surplus” implies something positive, when in fact those terms should be neutral and should not automatically carry any positive or negative connotation. ====================================== 4. San Diego Restaurant Recession? The chart above displays six-month percent changes in: a) San Diego’s restaurant jobs and b) non-restaurant payrolls in San Diego from 2006 to March 2017. While non-food jobs in the San Diego MSA are increasing at a steady rate of about 1% (semi-annually) and 2% annually, restaurant job growth has tanked and fell by 3.5% over the most recent six-month period through March 2017. In terms of jobs, restaurant employment in the San Diego area has fallen by a stunning 4,700 jobs since last September, at a rate of almost 200 job losses per week. During the same period, employment outside the food industry increased by more than 12,000 jobs in San Diego. San Diego’s minimum wage increased last July to $10.50 an hour and then again to $11.50 on January 1 of this year, which might explain at least part of the significant drop in restaurant jobs. Caveat: Employment data from the BLS are only available for the entire Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of San Diego, and data for just the city are not available. The city minimum wage is now $1 an hour higher than the state minimum wage of $10.50, which just increased on January 1 by 50 cents, and would be in effect outside the city limits. However, a recent San Diego Union-Tribune is reporting that “San Diego’s new minimum wage already may be killing jobs,” here’s a slice: Evidence has emerged of an economic dark side to San Diego’s decision last year to vault over the state minimum wage — it may have already destroyed thousands of jobs for low-wage workers even as higher pay helps tens of thousands of others. Consider the restaurant industry, for example, which economists study because it relies on low-wage workers, yet generally faces no foreign or out-of-state competition. Amid an abrupt slowdown in growth, nearly 4,000 food-service jobs may have been cut or not created throughout San Diego County from the beginning of 2016 through February of this year, according to an analysis of federal payroll data by Lynn Reaser, chief economist of the Fermanian Business & Economic Institute at Point Loma Nazarene University. “This was at a time when both overall economies performed similarly well,” Reaser said. “If job growth in the restaurant sector had just kept pace with the state’s performance … the industry could have created 5,200 jobs instead of the 1,300 that took place.” Last month growth turned negative, as the sector actually lost jobs. Note: The article quoted above was published before employment data were released for March, which reflected San Diego MSA restaurant job losses of another 900 in March, following losses of 1,300 in February, 400 in January, 500 in December, 1,200 in November and 400 in October — that’s a stunning loss of nearly 5,000 restaurant jobs in just six months, so there’s got to be something going on in San Diego. If it’s not the two recent minimum wage increases, what else could be responsible for the city’s “restaurant recession”? ==================================== 5. From a Waitress in Maine to the Do-Gooders and Anointed Ones: “I am a restaurant server, and I don’t need anyone to save me” is the title of her op-ed in the Bangor Daily News about Maine’s new minimum wage law passed last November that will increase the state minimum wage rise to $12 an hour by 2020 and eliminate the tip credit by 2024 (limiting servers’ hourly wage to the state minimum). Here’s a slice: You don’t know me, but I choose to be a server because serving works for me. I love what I do and how much income and flexibility it provides my family. You don’t know that I started working in restaurants at age 15, and 26 years later, I’m still happily employed as a server — by choice. You don’t know that, at 18, I was a single mom and serving provided me the income and flexibility to continue school, work, and raise my daughter. Serving also provided me the income to reach my personal goal of getting off state assistance by the time my daughter turned six. You don’t know that restaurant staff, owners and customers create a family atmosphere. That when my nine-year-old makes the baseball play-offs, and he has a last-minute game, I get my shift switched so I won’t miss his game nor the money. You don’t know that I am able to keep my four-year-old home to avoid high-cost day cares nor that I contribute significantly to my family because of the schedule serving provides. You don’t know these things about me because no one asked. No one asked why I work as a server or what it means to my family. No one asked about the real conditions I work in or how the owner treats me. No one asked, but there are certainly plenty of people telling me what the restaurant industry is like. I am not stuck. I do not need saving. I am not sexually harassed; my boss would never allow that. Restaurant owners are not greedy monsters putting us in unsafe work environments. I make an excellent living at a job I love. I do not make a “subminimum wage.” “Subminimum wage” is for disabled workers who are not able to perform the full duty of a job. By law, as a tipped worker, I am guaranteed to make at least minimum wage. I choose this job because I make much more than that. 6. Cartoon of the Day (above), another great one from the great one himself — Michael Ramirez. ===================================== 7. Economic Outlook Rankings for 2017 are displayed above, from the 10th annual study “Rich States, Poor States” by Art Laffer, Stephen Moore and Jonathan Williams. The “Economic Outlooks” are forecasts based on a state’s current standing in 15 state policy variables including top personal and corporate income tax rates, property and sales tax burdens, debt service as a share of tax revenue, public employees per 10,000, workers’ compensation costs, etc. When the states are ranked, an interesting pattern emerges: the top 14 states with the best economic outlooks this year are all right-to-work states, and the bottom 17 states with the worst economic outlook are all forced-union states. Although there are certainly other factors besides whether a state has right-to-work laws, it’s often been the case that empirical evidence finds that right-to-work states outperform compulsory union states for important economic variables like growth in employment and employee compensation, so the rankings in the table above are not too surprising. ============================================ 8. Energy Charts of the Day (above). The top chart displays oil production in America’s most prolific oil region – the Permian Basin in West Texas – which hasn’t slowed down at all despite the big drop in oil prices from above $100 per barrel as recently as July 2014 to around $50 for the last few years. Based on EIA estimates through next month, the increase in daily output in the Permian Basin over the most recent six month period of more than 260,000 barrels since last November will be the largest six-month increase in Texas history. The increases in Permian Basin oil output have contributed to bringing US oil output up to a 20-month high last week of 9.27 million barrels per day, see the middle chart above. US oil output has increased in each of the last ten weeks — the last period of ten consecutive increases in oil production was back in 2012. And the bottom chart shows how the increases in US oil production have brought petroleum imports down to 23.8% of the total petroleum supplied to the US market in 2017 through March. That’s the lowest share of imported petroleum in almost half a century going all the way back to 1970. Carpe oleum. =========================================== 9. Markets in Everything. Recharge (“luxury hotels unlocked“) is an app that lets users book luxury hotels for 66 cents per minute and just launched in New York City. Interesting idea and the service is not being offered for the reason you’re probably thinking right now…. 10. Interesting Fact of the Day. A stunning number — around 25% of US households — won’t have a traditional TV subscription by the end of 2017 as newer streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video grow in popularity. Expect the “cord cutting” to continue…. Bonus: Video of the Day from Prager U (below). American Indians are the poorest of all of America’s ethnic groups. Why? After all, the government has granted them massive reservations and created entire agencies to look after them. Well, maybe it’s that stifling government control that impoverishes Indians explains Naomi Schaefer Riley in the video below (“American Indians Are Still Getting a Raw Deal“), based on her book “The New Trail of Tears: How Washington Is Destroying American Indians.” Assorted links Discussion: (27 comments) Barry Bones April 28th, 2017 Governments have to raise a certain amount of coin for their activities be they welfare, education or even the military. The money has to come from somewhere. Trump is lowering taxes overall as well as shifting some of the tax base from personal / company tax to tariffs. He’s doing a good job; just look at GDP stats and the soaring share market. But only complainers here. Always complaining, but never really articulating, “well how would you pay for all of the government activities” (and don’t just say ‘scrap welfare’ because it isn’t practically feasible). Credit where it’s due, Captain Trump has done a great job. Woot Woot !! Reply Share Mark Perry April 28th, 2017 A good job by looking at GDP stats? You’re kidding I guess….. Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Mark, I like the fact that you comment regularly on your own blog. I also like the quality of your blog. You provide a lot of good information. Reply Share morganovich April 29th, 2017 barry- in terms of a place to raise revenue (and i would argue that we already have WAY too much government revenue and should be looking for ways to cut it and cut the absurd spending levels) a tariff is one of the absolute worst one can choose. it inflicts a deadweight loss on consumers 100% of the time, and quite literally breaks the mechanism by which we are all made better off: greater access to trade driving an increase in the overall production and consumption possibility frontiers through comparative advantage. for any given level of spending, tariffs are probably the worst way to fund it and, worse still, will never be able to raise any real revenue. they simply cannot. they destroy the thing they tax too rapidly. GDP just collapsed. did you not see the q1 data? it was the lowest number in 3 years. if 0.7% growth is “soaring” i’d hate to see “tepid”. you are using a straw man argument from a false premise. government spending is what is out of control. revenues are at record levels. there are 100 ways to drop government spending. raise the social security age. pare back medicare and medicaid. cut military spending in half. all this is highly possible and is going to HAVE to happen. entitlements in particular are an actuarial bomb. no tax rate will be able to pay for them. we have what, $80tn of unfunded liabilities? never. gonna. happen. it cannot be paid for so it must be cut. imposing tariffs will, over 10 years, actually reduce overall tax revenues. you get lower growth because the economy is less efficient so you are taking a piece of a smaller future pie from all manner of tax. it’s the equivalent of filling your shoes with cement before you run a race. worse, economic illiterates like you are falling for it. repeating the same nonsense over and over will not make it true. Reply Share Jon Murphy April 29th, 2017 just look at GDP stats and the soaring share market. GDP growth in the 1st quarter was 0.7%. Consumer spending was at the lowest level since the depths of the recession. Reply Share Jon Murphy April 29th, 2017 Governments have to raise a certain amount of coin for their activities be they welfare, education or even the military. The money has to come from somewhere. Trump’s (and your) rhetoric indicate that this is not the reason for the tariffs. Reply Share Jon Murphy April 29th, 2017 Here’s the thing, Barry. Presumably you’re a smart guy (at least, according to you), which makes me wonder why you’re laying down the “tariffs as revenue” smokescreen. It’s clearly a misdirection. The hypocrisy of Trump is not that he wants to use tariffs. It’s that he argues that both high taxes are causing American businesses to be uncompetitive in the global market and that taxing American businesses at higher rates will “make America great again” and strengthen American businesses. This never was, and never will be, a revenue argument. It’s a straight-up contradiction. Now, obviously since I am not on the Trump Train, and since I never ran a business, I must be dumber than you and Trump. So, if the contradiction is obvious to me, it must be blindingly obvious to you and Trump. Which makes me wonder why you trotted out the revenue argument? Do you think me a fool? Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Barry, “well how would you pay for all of the government activities” That is not why you and Trump said you wanted tariffs. Why would you change your reasoning now? BTW, it is silly to lower one tax while raising another to pay for government expenses. “Credit where it’s due, Captain Trump has done a great job.” What has he done? Be specific. The President does not control the stock market or the economy. “Woot Woot !!” I’m glad that you have chosen to update your word choice from the 15th century. Perhaps you ought to update your economics from 15th century mercantilism. Reply Share Walt Greenway April 29th, 2017 “The President does not control the stock market or the economy. “ The long-term performance of the stock market is driven primarily by company earnings, but there’s no doubt the President can cause large daily or short-term swings in the market by saying or doing the right or wrong things. Reply Share Paul April 28th, 2017 2. Reagan, who is quoted here often, cut income taxes early on and then in the next several years raised them in multiple ways, eliminated loopholes, and slapped tariffs on Japanese motorcycles. 7. Economic Outlook Rankings…notice the top 10 are all red states. The bottom ten deep blue. Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Paul, Reagan made mistakes and sometimes pursued politically correct, though economically wrong, policies. He was much better than either Jimmy Carter or Walter Mondale though. This is not a red team vs. blue team issue. The issue is always between the political class and their political cronies vs. those of us who have to pay for their follies. Reply Share Paul April 29th, 2017 Greg, Yes, Reagan, like Trump, was much better than the alternative. And IMHO, Trump is better than Reagan (so far) on some issues. Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Nah. Reagan compromised his principles occasionally to get votes for other priorities like destroying the Soviet Union. Trump is just playing politically correct games to pander to political cronies and his own ego. Trump isn’t even in the ballpark when it comes to Reagan. Reply Share Paul April 29th, 2017 Greg, So the tariffs Reagan slapped on Japanese crotch rockets helped him win the cold war? Come on, man. I guess we’ll have to disagree here. I see Trump proposing to gut the budgets at big gray buildings staffed with liberals like EPA, HUD, HHS, and actually eliminating 62 worthless agencies and programs, and think libertarians might take a shine to him, or at least praise his efforts on issues where they claim to agree. Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Paul, I see that you do not understand the legislative process. You tell the representatives where Harleys are made that you will impose a tariff if they vote for something the President wants even though it is against democratic party ideology. “proposing” That is a key word. I support Trump where he is right and oppose him where he is wrong. Don’t tell me what he intends to do. Wait until he has done it. I am still waiting on the repeal of Obamacare. Share Paul April 29th, 2017 Greg, You tell the representatives where Harleys are made that you will impose a tariff if they vote for something the President wants even though it is against democratic party ideology. Yeah, that’s not how it went down though: “President Reagan today defended his decision to order a tenfold increase in tariffs for heavyweight motorcycles, insisting that it was not a breach of his free-trade policy but only a temporary protection to help American manufacturers to readjust to Japanese competitors.” http://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/11/business/reagan-defends-motorcycle-tariff-steel-quotas.html And here is the great free-trader taking credit for Harley’s comeback: “In a speech to the workers at the end of his visit, the President said: ”Now, there are those in Congress who say our trade policies have not worked, but you, here at Harley-Davidson, are living proof that our laws are working.” And here’s Mises with a long list of Reagan’s protectionist measures that make Trump look like Adam Smith: https://mises.org/library/ronald-reagan-protectionist I support Trump where he is right and oppose him where he is wrong. Well,that’s a start. So do I. Don’t tell me what he intends to do. Wait until he has done it. I am still waiting on the repeal of Obamacare. What was that you said about understanding the legislative process? Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Paul, Reagan made mistakes. He compromised his principles at times to get the votes necessary for other priorities. Trump is not doing that. This is not a red team vs blue team issue. The issue is always politicians and their political cronies vs those of us who have to pay for their follies. Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Wow!

Reply Share Seattle Sam April 29th, 2017 Minimum wage laws and union shop laws both have the same objective — to protect higher skilled workers from having to compete with lower-skilled workers. What is particularly galling is that both are done in the name of helping the very people that are locked out of employment they would otherwise bid for. The politicians who enact these laws see personal advantage in this scheme because the number of people who are priced out of work is much smaller than those who benefit from it.

Wouldn’t other businesses besides restaurants be affected by an increase in minimum wages? Would be interesting to see, say, retail jobs. Reply Share Mark Perry April 29th, 2017 Growth in retail jobs in SD (MSA) has slowed to about 0% in the last year, not the same steep decline as food jobs, but lower growth than average for payrolls in SD. Reply Share Jon Murphy April 29th, 2017 It would be most obvious in restaurant. Approximately 55-60% of jobs in food services are low-skilled. It’s around 33% for retail. Reply Share Vic Volpe April 30th, 2017 #3 — https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=dxJK Difference between GDP and GNP — GDP is what Americans (not foreigners) produce in the U.S.; GNP is what Americans produce within the U.S. and overseas in foreign countries (U.S. companies and American investors earning on their foreign investments). Note: The two lines almost overlap up until the mid-2000s (under Bush) and continue under Obama, where they diverge from the earlier trendline by about 40%. Why? Reply Share Benjamin Cole April 30th, 2017 #5 Seems to me both the right-wing and the left-wing want to the oxygen out of the air—when the “other side” wants to speak. I have praised Liberty University for their election-year invite to socialist Bernie Sanders, who went and spoke and was received cordially. That is the model. But I see no Marxist professors on George Mason University staff (Googled it) and if a Marxist was ever invited to speak, it does not show up on Google. Full snowflake jackets come in red and blue. Should not an economics department have the full range of thought? I happen to be a free-marketeer, so much so I oppose property zoning of any kind. That said, Dr. Perry might want to tip his hat to this excellent study: https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Ikeda-Land-Use-Regulation.pdf Reply Share Leave a comment: Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Maintaining a coherent digital experience appears to be an essential element of the solution. By Dion Hinchcliffe for Enterprise Web 2.0 | April 29, 2017 -- 19:26 GMT (12:26 PDT) | Topic: Social Enterprise The news these days continues to be filled with reports that traditional stores are at last being sustainably displaced by fast growing online competitors. Startups in online shopping, media, travel, financial services, sharing economy, and finally even healthcare, have either invented popular new high-growth digital categories or are in the midst of successfully re-imagining the old ones in digital native terms. In the 2000s, the digital disruption had more to do with industries on the economic edge, such as digital music with iTunes, e-commerce with Amazon, and online advertising with Google. In the 2010s, digital is hitting core industries a bit harder: In transportation, Uber has achieved more revenue in its first 7 years of operation than either Amazon, Google, or Facebook did, all while securing a private valuation that's larger than industry bellwether Ford. The same has taken place in hospitality, where Airbnb is now valued right around as much as the two largest old guard hotel chains in the world, combined. Along the way, these so-called legacy firms, especially ones with retail stores, are now finding that their visitors, sales, and very existence are being rapidly eroded by more contemporary, easier-to-use, and highly compelling digital offerings, even as they continue to experience slow going. While there's nothing truly new here in terms of the macro trend, except for the scale, speed, and depth of the disruption, it's little wonder then that significant attention is finally being given to digital transforming the traditional organization. Customer experience: The linchpin of digital transformation The industry data varies, but the message being transmitted to the business world seems evident: Create and sustain better customer experiences, infused with digital capabilities and meaningful engagement, or begin heading increasing irrelevance or even the dustbin of corporate history. A recent retail CEO survey by JDA/PwC confirms that many leaders have received this message, with digital transformation ranking as their highest investment priority in 2017. Certainly this was the core message I encountered at Sprinklr's Digital Transformation Summit in Nashville this month. Sprinklr, not quite a household name yet even in enterprise circles, is however one of the most well-known social media management firms at the moment, and a noted leader in the industry. The premise of the event -- an IT leadership priority that I also observed in my own CIO survey recently -- is that the single most important boundary an organization has is between itself and its customers. That boundary is the realm were the critical and business-sustaining activities of customer experience takes place. It's where business and commerce today gets done, how the customer journey is played out, and where value is created and exchanged, in whatever combination of ever-multiplying digital arenas. The digital operating environment: A fast-evolving target In a previous era, customer experience was largely conducted in-person and in well-defined physical locations. In the digital world, customer experience now happens literally everywhere: On mobile devices, in apps, on laptops, on wearables, inside games, in connected IoT devices, via chatbots, and on and on. In other words in places you often aren't aware of and/or don't expect with a more static and traditional view of customer experience. As I've noted in the past, the value of a high quality customer experience, especially in the digital world, is strategically and competitively significant: Customer experience leaders outperform the S&P 500 by a good margin. So vital is customer experience that one main speaker at the event, the noted social media industry analyst and New York Time bestselling author, Charlene Li, made the point perhaps the most bluntly: Today, "if you're not working on customer experience, then you're working on the wrong thing." Perhaps the most significant and persuasive presenter at the Digital Transformation Summit, however, is also one of the most respected figures in technology, Cisco chairman John Chambers. Cisco chairman John Chambers notes that small to medium organizations can transform their customer experience faster at Sprinklr's Digital Transformation Summit in Nashville. Image by Dion Hinchcliffe. Making an impassioned case for fixing a typical customer experience that has become entirely too fragmented, haphazard, and poorly integrated in many organizations, Chambers noted that most of us "have dozens of vendors that support customer experience in our organizations, but the reality is that few work well together." So we end up with more and more experience silos, as new channels and devices continue to grow and proliferate. As importantly, Chambers noted that new digital competitors emerge, without nearly as many constraints as we have, and reinvent a better customer experience upon whole new cloth. In response he said, "you must either disrupt or be disrupted. And you can't disrupt while operating in silos or without single view of the customer." Perceiving your customers through the digital 'fog' Ostensibly, operating cross silo across customer experience channels is the industry competency that the event's sponsor, Sprinklr, is most well known for -- a capability to perceive, manage, and exchange value with one's customers through a single lens, instead of spread out across hundreds of digital channels, where you can't tell who they really are, or if they're the same individudal or not. Addressing this now pervasive challenge was a key motivation for the event itself, in fact. As Sprinkr's VP of Product Enablement, Paul Herman observed later in the day, without this integrated view you end up in the unenviable and unsatisfying situation of "having 50 first dates with a customer." That is, going through the same process of getting-to-know-you and initial engagement over and over again, as you they connect with you via different digital channels and devices over time. Addressed correctly, this disassociation of experience can be resolved by looking at the process holistically, then offering a more contextual and informed journey for the customer. This can be achieved by centrally managing customer identity, then building on historic knowledge of the customer and previous interactions with them. Of course, perhaps the biggest root cause of broken and fragmented customer experience is sheer digital proliferation itself, both channels on the consumer side and marketing stacks on the enterprise side. As marketing technology expert Scott Brinker has recently noted, there has been a genuine explosion of marketing vendors and solutions over the last 6 years, going from 150 point marketing solutions in 2011 to over 3,500 today. The same on the consumer side, where there are thousands of digital and social channels, from apps and online communities, to social networks and microsites. Digital proliferation depicted and made real: Growth of marketing automation solutions since 2011. Image by Scott Brinker. Sustainably manage digital channel complexity Finally, it was a speaker towards the end of the summit, Kellog School professor Mohan Sawhney, that made perhaps the most profound statement on motivation: With the fundamentally limited amount of attention that humans can possibly spend, and with every marketer, advertiser, and salesperson trying to get their attention with an ever growing amount of content and digital experience, he noted, then "if we don't [take great care to] orchestrate customer experience, it just becomes noise." That then brings us full circle to a trend that's becoming more common across digital products and services as a whole: Contextualization. That is, making it easy for the user to understand where they are, why they are there, what they are doing, and what comes next in the digital experience they're currently in. Three lessons for digital transformation of customer experience From all this, we can derive a few instrumental take-aways for CIOs and CMOs that want to sustainably succeed on their ongoing journey of digital transformation: Organizations have a mandate today to simplify, properly contextualize, and make effective customer interactions on as many touch points as they can over time. Being a digital leader requires proactively using multichannel data to maintain an integrated picture of the customer, and then actualize a rich and useful customer journey using this knowledge. Use leverage to outsource or otherwise manage the complexity of the ever-evolving digital world. In other words, no organization alone can address digital proliferation. While today's digital operating environments are as complicated as they've ever been, they are also the most potentially rewarding for those that can learn to manage their intricacies and constant shifts. It's also key to realize that it's still early days in the history of digital customer engagement, so cultivating multichannel customer experience management as a dynamic capability as a core competency is a long-term survival strategy richly worth the time and investment.

Whether you prefer the iTunes App Store or Google Play, you’ll find an all-you-can-download buffet of mind-blowing software for your mobile device.   People are always asking me what apps they should get. The answer depends, of course, on many things. What are your pastimes? What do you need help with? Some people subsist on Tinder. Others are obsessed with Google Translate, or Pokémon Go, or Pandora. We each have our unique preferences.  But certain apps rise above the rest. They’re powerful, they’re fun, and they’re incredibly useful. They’re top in their category, and almost every user ends up exclaiming, “Wow, I can’t believe how cool this thing is!” Here are 10 of those must-have apps, plus a bonus.

The little map will show you fellow Waze users on the highway, and they routinely report accidents and speed traps to make your trip smoother. Read more details on Waze. Photoshop Fix For casual shooters, Adobe Photoshop is overkill. There’s no need to “rasterize” a photo, add layers, or “lasso” pieces of an image. Most people just want to fiddle with the contrast and retouch the photo a bit. Now you can do that from your phone, thanks to Adobe’s Photoshop Fix. But there’s more. You can automatically add color and remove entire chunks of a photo, such as an unsightly tattoo, with a few finger swabs. No graphic design degree required. More details on Photoshop Fix. Buffer Social media is fun, but it can also be a lot of work. You can spend hours crafting the right tweet, then the right Facebook post, then an Instagram photo, then… well, you know. Buffer allows you to orchestrate all of these social media releases from the same dashboard, and you can even schedule the date and time that the posts are sent out. For campaign managers and businesspeople, Buffer is an incredible luxury, aggregating such disparate services as Pinterest and Tumblr. More details on Buffer.

Whatever the reason, you want to get exercise and feel healthier, but what you need is hard motivation. That’s where Pact comes in. You set health goals on the app, and when you don’t reach them, you have to pay other Pact members money. Like, real money. But when you do reach your goals, other people pay you. It’s kind of like gambling, except you always win, as long as you reach your benchmarks. Pact may sound like a crazy gimmick, but it has inspired 11.8 million workouts to date, claiming a 92% success rate. Read more on Pact. Sleep Cycle We all know about our “circadian rhythm,” or sleep cycles. Over the course of 90 minutes, typical sleepers enter different phases of sleep, from light sleep to the dreamy REM phase and back. It would be nice to harness that cycle to our benefit, but how could we? We’re asleep! Sleep Cycle is an app that takes data on your sleep patterns, and then it figures out the right time to wake you up.

By Sarmistha Acharya April 29, 2017 19:19 BST Google to challenge tax demands issued by the ATO Getty Images/Guang Niu Google said it will challenge tax assessments issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In accounts filed with the Australian Securities and Investment Commissions, Google's Australian unit said it will "lodge an objection" to the tax demand from the ATO. In a financial statement released on Friday (28 April) Google said: "The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims," without disclosing how much the OTA has demanded in taxes, suggests a Reuters report. The OTA has increased scrutiny on the multi-nationals that are operating in Australia for the amount of tax they are paying in continent. Last December it said it was pursuing seven major businesses over $1.50 billion in unpaid tax, although it did not reveal details about the name of the companies. In April Scott Morrison, Australian treasurer, said under tax avoidance legislation the country is expected to claw back $2.9bn from multinational companies. "We are making sure that multinationals, as they should, pay their fair share of tax, so that Australian citizens get the tax from the profits earned in Australia from Australian customers that is needed to fund vital infrastructure and services here in this country," Morrison said. The Multinational Anti-Avoidance law came in to effect in December 2015 and the ATO has introduced the new guidelines for foreign companies. The law was aimed at addressing the issues of the multi-national companies using loopholes to minimise the tax payment in Australia. The law applies to the companies with global income over $1bn. Google Australia in its financial statement revealed an increase in revenue and tax for 2016.

In summary, if you want access to the internet to look like this, you should be against net neutrality, like the administration’s new chair at the FCC (via): If you don’t, then you should be for net neutrality. In this post, I’ll explain what net neutrality is, review how net neutrality was protected under the Obama administration, how and why the Trump administration seeks to remove that protection, take a quick look at the current state of play, and conclude with how contact the FCC to share your views. What Is Net Neutrality? The term “net neutrality” was coined by Tim Wu (interviewed at NC here when he was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York). In fact, Wu wrote the FAQ (which you should read in its entirety): Network neutrality is best defined as a network design principle. The idea is that a maximally useful public information network aspires to treat all content, sites, and platforms equally. This allows the network to carry every form of information and support every kind of application. That’s more than a little wonky, so let’s give an English translation. From the Google: The principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites. And if you think about how you “surf the web,” treating “all content, sites, and platforms equally” (“access to all content and applications regardless of the source “) pretty much describes how your Internet works; you can click seamlessly from a small blog like Naked Capitalism to an enormous website like Google’s search page to YouTube or Vimeo for video to satellite imagery from NASA to a Bear Cam in Katmai National Park, Alaska. Who could be against that? Well, I’m not going to describe the entire corporate landscape of Internet Service Providers (ISP) and all their incentives (telcos large and small, cable companies, satellite dish companies, etc). But here’s a high-level metaphor: The Internet was famously described by then-Alaska Senator Ted Stevens as “a series of tubes” (the “Intertubes”). What if you not only owned one of those tubes, but you owned some of the data — but not all! — of the data flowing, like water, through your tubes? (Much like Time-Warner owns a tube, and also rents movies — data — on demand.) Wouldn’t you want to maximize the profit from your control of your tube — and cripple your competitors — by giving your data priority? Of course you would. Hence the reductio ad absurdum of the image above. And hence the necessity for regulation to ensure, as Tim Wu puts it, “a maximally useful public information network” (emphasis mine). How the Obama Administration Protected Net Neutrality Although the Obama administration initially set the table for net neutrality’s abolition — its choice for FCC Commissioner, Tom Wheeler, was a tube cable lobbyist — a successful grassroots campaign — which, besides online activists, also included corporate heavweights that benefit from net neutrality, like Google — ultimately led in 2015 to net neutrality’s adoption, as the FCC decided to regulate ISPs under Title II of the Communications Act as common carriers. (This is like treating ISPs as public utilities, and the issue is often framed that way, but the two are not identical in function or law). Tim Wu explains “common carrier”: The concept of a “common carrier,” dating from 16th century English common law, captures many similar concepts [to open access and anti-discrimination remedies for “threats to the end-to-end nature of the Internet”]. A common carrier, in its original meaning, is a private entity that performs a public function (the law was first developed around port authorities). Taxis, for example, are common carriers. After stopping for you in the tube street, your taxi driver can’t discriminate by handing you a different rate sheet if they don’t like the look of you, or refuse to take you to your destination. (And when they do, they’re failing in their duty.) Ars Technica explains how the common carrier concept operates for ISPs under the FCC’s ruling: FCC officials also provided further background in a phone call with reporters today. One thing they were clear on: this isn’t “utility-style regulation,” because there will be no rate regulation, Internet service providers (ISPs) won’t have to file tariffs, and there’s no unbundling requirement that would force ISPs to lease network access to competitors. But the order does reclassify ISPs as common carriers, regulating them under Title II of the Communications Act, the same statute that governs telephone companies. Internet providers will be common carriers in their relationships with home Internet and mobile broadband customers; they will also be common carriers in their relationships with companies that deliver content to subscribers over the networks operated by ISPs. That includes online content providers such as Amazon or Netflix. The ban on blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization is the biggest takeaway. “Broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices… may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices… [and] may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration—in other words, no ‘fast lanes.’ This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates,” the FCC said. The core provisions of Title II banning “unjust and unreasonable practices” will be used to enforce these rules. In other words, the tube owners won’t be able to maxmize profit from their control of their tubes by treating data owned by others differently data they own themselves, exactly like taxi drivers can’t discriminate against riders, because taxis are common carriers. The New York Times gives the political background for the FCC decision. From 2015: The new rules, approved 3 to 2 along party lines, are intended to ensure that no content is blocked and that the Internet is not divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for Internet and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else. Those prohibitions are hallmarks of the net neutrality concept. Before the vote, each of the five commissioners spoke and the Republicans delivered a scathing critique of the order as overly broad, vague and unnecessary. Ajit Pai, a Republican commissioner, said the rules were government meddling in a vibrant, competitive market and were likely to deter investment, undermine innovation and ultimately harm consumers. Opponents of the new rules, led by cable television and telecommunications companies, say adopting the Title II approach opens the door to bureaucratic interference with business decisions that, if let stand, would reduce incentives to invest and thus raise prices and hurt consumers. Supporters of the Title II model include many major Internet companies, start-ups and public interest groups. In a statement, Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, which includes Google, Facebook and smaller online companies, called the F.C.C. vote “a welcome step in our effort to create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules.” The F.C.C.’s yearlong path to issuing rules to ensure an open Internet precipitated an extraordinary level of political involvement, from grass-roots populism to the White House, for a regulatory ruling. The F.C.C. received four million comments, about a quarter of them generated through a campaign organized by groups including Fight for the Future, an advocacy nonprofit. Ajit Pai is, of course, the new FCC commissioner under the incoming Trump Administration, which immediately moved to re-open the debate and roll back the ISPs Title II designation, as the 3-2 party line votes suggests they would. Since none of power players or financial incentives have changed, we can expect quite a battle.[1] And exactly as in 2015, we should not assume the battle is lost. It isn’t. How the Trump Administration Seeks to Eliminate Net Neutrality Here’s the PDF of Pai’s full speech, where he begins his assault.[2] Gizmodo has a fine summary here, of which I’ll pull out just one point, since I’ve been focusing on those tubes and, as the first image shows, what the “Intertubes” would look like if those tube owners weren’t forced to act as common carriers: In his speech, Pai said “Nothing about the Internet was broken in 2015. Nothing about the law had changed. And there wasn’t a rash of Internet service providers blocking customers from accessing the content, applications, or services of their choice.” This is incredibly disingenuous. Note how Pai said ISPs weren’t blocking traffic to certain sites, because sure, that wasn’t happening. But blocking wasn’t the only kind of harm prevented by the net neutrality order: it also had bright-line rules against paid prioritization and throttling, where ISPs would limit or boost traffic to certain websites. One of the most high-profile examples of abuse was Comcast throttling traffic to Netflix in order to extract a payment deal from the streaming video provider, which it eventually agreed to pay. And in 2012, AT&T blocked FaceTime on iPhones, claiming it was using too much bandwidth. In this case, critics argued it was an attempt to block a service that competed with its own voice services. And as the biggest ISPs keep gobbling up content-producers, like AT&T buying DirectTV and then providing free access to its content, the risks that ISPs will start prioritizing traffic only increase. (There are plenty of other specious arguments in Pai’s screed, like the idea that net neutrality — as opposed to monopolization — is preventing ISPs from investing in infrastructure. I’m sure we’ll get to all of them over time.) Tim Wu explains what’s really going on — ka-ching — on the opinion page of the New York Times. Speaking to motive: President Trump’s chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate net neutrality (technically, make it “voluntary”) despite its popularity, record of success and acceptance by most of the industry. His proposal is of dubious legality. But should it succeed, the only real winners will be the cable and phone industries [the tube owners], which will gain yet another way to raise prices for everyone. The proposal is the epitome of senseless government action and sharply out of step with Mr. Trump’s populist mandate. Did Trump voters really vote for higher cable bills? In addition: The more convincing explanations for this change are more straightforward — and darker — than Mr. Pai’s. Much of Silicon Valley and Hollywood have supported both net neutrality and the Democratic Party, making an attack on the policy a kind of punishment. If Mr. Pai’s reasoning sounds forced and unconvincing, it is because this proposal comes right from the swamp, and can be attractive only to those who have lived there long enough to no longer notice the stench. And the World Wide Web Foundation concludes: Today Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Ajit Pai made clear he intends to dismantle strong net neutrality protections in the US. If approved, his plan would reverse a 2015 FCC ruling to reclassify internet service providers (ISPs) as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. The 2015 regulation was key for the roll-out of effective and enforceable net neutrality rules that would prevent ISPs from arbitrarily slowing down, or even blocking, internet traffic. Our founder, Sir Tim Berners-Lee said: “When I invented the web, I didn’t have to ask anyone for permission, and neither did America’s successful internet entrepreneurs when they started their businesses. To reach its full potential, the internet must remain a permissionless space for creativity, innovation and free expression. In today’s world companies can’t operate without internet, and access to it is controlled by just a few providers. The FCC’s announcements today suggest they want to step back and allow concentrated market players to pick winners and losers online. Their talk is all about getting more people connected, but what is the point if your ISP only lets you watch the movies they choose, just like the old days of cable?” Or throttles the small sites so the big sites get a smidgeon more speed? Contacting the FCC Here, in detail, is how to comment on the new FCC proposal, with the screen you will see: Just like last time, you can comment on net neutrality using the FCC’s same old archaic and weird comments system, but this time it should have the back end to support a ton of traffic. This comment process will happen in two waves. Right now, you can comment on the draft proposal, which has lots of questions about how the final proposal should be worded. The second comment cycle will be about the official proposal, will begin after May 18 and will be open for three months. You should be able to comment on both. Here’s how to do it now: Head to the listing for the “Restoring Internet Freedom” proposal (you can also search for Docket 17-108), which is perhaps the most ludicrously self-serving and false title we’ve seen in a while. Most of us can just click on “+ Express” on the left sidebar. This will send you to a simplified submission form. If you want to send more info, like attachments and images, use the “+New Filing” option. Fill out out the form and click on “Continue to review screen” when you’re finished. Review your comment, then send it off. You will need to include your name, home address, and phone number. All of that will be publicly accessible. That’s just part of the deal here. It couldn’t hurt if you contacted your Congress critter as well. Letters to the Editor are also very effective, so do write one to your local newspaper. And if you have other suggestions, please leave them in comments! Conclusion Naked Capitalism is a small blog. It’s in our interest — and we like to think it’s in your interest too, dear readers, and in the public interest as well — to be just as accessible to the public on the Internet as a giant site like the Washington Post or the New York Times (or Facebook). If you agree, please support Naked Capitalism and all small blogs by vociferously supporting network neutrality in every venue available to you. Help Naked Capitalism stay unthrottled! NOTES [1] Here let me note the disgraceful role of the NAACP, and other players in the Black Misleadership Class, in opposing net neutrality after collecting cash from ISPs. Ka-ching. [2] Pai also gave a remarkable speech at the Newseum: Pai said that his predecessor’s net neutrality rules were “all about politics,” in a speech at the Newseum in Washington on Wednesday. “Two years ago, I warned that we were making a serious mistake,” Pai said. “It’s basic economics: The more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you’re likely to get.” You know, like food. Or water. Or air. Shaking my head… 00804 This entry was posted in Banana republic, Guest Post, Infrastructure, Regulations and regulators, Technology and innovation on April 29, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

The picture above says it all. This site is a great example of what the Internet can and should be, and it demonstrates one right way (not necessarily the only way) of going about it. There are no ads, because you’re not selling anything. You provide an excellent service that people are willing to support you for, but it’s all voluntary. Compare this to endless pages and pages of garbage whose only purpose is convince, cajole, or otherwise manipulate someone into clicking a link to a commercial site selling crap that no one needs or wants. The signal to noise ratio is abysmal, and net neutrality is something that helps to reign in the exploitation. Because the Internet is such a powerful tool, with immense potential for positive change, I believe the way this battle goes, and the fate what the Internet is to ultimately become is of great importance. Also, say what you want about Obama, he did end up supporting and helping this particular cause. What good it will do, remains to be seen I guess. Reply ↓ Vatch April 29, 2017 at 4:26 pm Also, say what you want about Obama, he did end up supporting and helping this particular cause. I agree. Obama was a giant disappointment, but Trump is clearly worse. I’m still furious at the Democratic Party for giving us such a terrible choice in the recent Presidential election. As we all know, some people voted for Trump simply because Clinton was so very bad. As for Trump, he’s the one who chose Ajit Pai to be the chairman of the FCC, so Trump shares the blame for this fiasco. Reply ↓ hal April 29, 2017 at 5:41 pm Obama also appointed Pai to the FCC Trump made him Chairman. This would not have stopped Trump from doing his dirty work but Obama (You know $400,000 per speech) set the wheels in motion. Reply ↓ Vatch April 29, 2017 at 7:16 pm Right now, there are two vacancies on the FCC. No more than 3 members of the commission can belong to the same political party, and we currently have 2 Republicans and 1 Democrat. Trump withdrew Obama’s renomination of Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel. Prior to that, the Republican Senate sat on her renomination for more than a year (reminiscent of Merrick Garland). http://thehill.com/policy/technology/322064-trump-drops-former-fcc-dems-renomination-bid https://www.congress.gov/nomination/114th-congress/512 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Rosenworcel https://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/fcc-votes-for-net-neutrality-a-ban-on-paid-fast-lanes-and-title-ii/ FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said, “We cannot have a two-tiered Internet with fast lanes that speed the traffic of the privileged and leave the rest of us lagging behind. We cannot have gatekeepers who tell us what we can and cannot do and where we can and cannot go online, and we do not need blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization schemes that undermine the Internet as we know it.” Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 29, 2017 at 6:24 pm Also, say what you want about Obama, he did end up supporting and helping this particular cause. Especially since he has once again reared his head and is attempting to hypnotize American with his serpentine gaze, I think it’s really important we continually remember the reality of Barack Obama: – He was put in power to protect Wealth, FIRE and multi-national corporations. – His value to his masters relied and continues to rely on his mask of Goodness, which all his administration’s dirty deeds hid behind. – That was why the veal pen strategy was so important. Whenever anyone broke out of the pen long enough to pull on the mask until his real face was visible, he had to retreat. If he was ever fully exposed, the game was over — not so much for his masters, but for him. He and Michelle are young. For their turn at “foundation building,” obscene book deals, massive speaking fees, etc. to be maximally profitable, he had to exit the White House with his mask of Goodness in place. – In the late stages of his presidency, he was clearly anticipating that his successor would be the one left without a mask to wear, as public fury mounted at the after effects of what he had done. Hillary Clinton was perfect for this role: she’s used to be hated, she visibly enjoys hurting people, and she and her husband have already grifted hundreds of millions of dollars openly (I suspect there’s a lot more they control that’s hidden.) – Obama appointed Pai to the FCC. I don’t see why we should give Obama any credit at all for what happened in 2015. Major Democratic donors, like Google (aka Obama’s owners) were in favor of going common carrier, weren’t they? And that helped fuel the grassroots protests. His owners wanted common carrier, and citizens were pulling hard at his mask of Goodness. So he retreated, and got all sorts of praise for doing what was in the interests of major Democratic Party donors that Hillary was probably already hitting up for campaign donations. What am I missing? Reply ↓ Vatch April 29, 2017 at 7:17 pm Please see my reply to Hal on April 29, 2017 at 5:41 pm. Reply ↓ Marina Bart April 30, 2017 at 1:17 am Sorry, Vatch. I don’t see how that disproves anything I said. He gave the Republicans their majority and ability to stymie nominations, too. Reply ↓ allan April 29, 2017 at 3:17 pm Pai said, “It’s basic economics: The more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you’re likely to get.” You would hope that an FCC chair could do better than spouting Econ 101 platitudes. Maybe the NC commentariat should chip in and buy Pai a copy of James Kwak’s Economism. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 29, 2017 at 4:31 pm A couple of points: while the neutrality rule did win the first round of court challenge it could still be shot down in court. In June 2016, in an 184-page ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld, by a 2-1 vote, the FCC’s net neutrality rules and the FCC’s determination that broadband access is a public utility, rather than a luxury. AT&T and the telecom industry said that they would seek to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#United_States And the issue isn’t quite as simple as it may seem since video companies like Netflix absorb a large percentage of total web bandwidth and perhaps should be discriminated against. In which case the question would be who will do the discriminating, business or government. This link has a handy graph. http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/01/20/netflix-boasts-37-share-of-internet-traffic-in-north-america-compared-with-3-for-apples-itunes Reply ↓ hunkerdown April 29, 2017 at 5:23 pm I’ve worked as a lead engineer at an ISP. Services are only weakly associated with routing. Downloaded Internet traffic is only weakly associated with backbone Internet traffic. I’m a/bemused that you’re citing statistics from a deep-packet-inspection gear manufacturer whose products are designed to construct and meter non-neutral networks and which (and who) have no reason to exist in a neutral network. > video companies like Netflix fail at network design by hosting all their videos in a centralized location, rather than collocating shipping containers with ports for 10Gb Ethernet and however many amps of power at the network edge, like, say, YouTube. With ISP consolidation being what it is, that’s maybe 1000 servers scattered across the US and however many overseas. Not that I’m foily, but I see this as complementary to the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act, by which our “friends” at Google, Facebook and Twitter have announced information control initiatives (and whose stocks apparently jumped a bit on the news, as Mr. Haygood noted a few days ago). Reply ↓ Carolinian April 29, 2017 at 6:14 pm No need for foilly. In fact as I say below I believe “our friends” at the ISPs and major corporations need greater scrutiny when it comes to how they are changing the web. But I do question whether big investments in infrastructure so Netflix can more conveniently deliver House of Cards are warranted. The poorer customers subsidize all those investments in fiber, cell towers, frequency purchases etc and that creates a different form of discrimination in terms of access and rent seeking, at least here in the US. Which is to say IMO the big providers need more regulation, not less. Just declaring “net neutrality” isn’t enough. Since you work in this field happy to hear a contrary view. Reply ↓ hunkerdown April 29, 2017 at 9:48 pm Netflix hosts their entire service on the Amazon cloud, which is anything but free. I agree that Netflix benefits disproportionately from ISPs building direct pipes to Amazon as a prerequisite to reaching Netflix, as does no friend of ours Amazon and their cloud customers, as do to a lesser extent anyone else along the same route. I contest that subsidy is a useful frame to describe the apportionment of financing for a resource that can’t be stored and (as under net neutrality) can’t be reserved, in the same sense that building another common lane on a busy interstate constitutes a subsidy for UPS. According to the principles of a neutral network, the decision to discriminate against Netflix has the flip side of discriminating in favor of Amazon, who are the true culprits as far as network operations are concerned. I agree that network operators need to be regulated more; in fact, they need to be regulated into utilities much like sewerage, where one pays for the size of the outlet pipe to handle their effluent which indirectly pays for the facilities to process it according to volume, rather than discriminate according to how much soap is in the dish water or whatever. Of course, regulations in the USA are mostly orthogonal to enforcement actions, or Amazon would be paying for their customers’ effluent. Reply ↓ Kurtismayfield April 29, 2017 at 4:47 pm And the issue isn’t quite as simple as it may seem since video companies like Netflix absorb a large percentage of total web bandwidth and perhaps should be discriminated against. In which case the question would be who will do the discriminating, business or government. Netflix pays for every byte it uses. The end user pays for every byte it uses. There is no reason why the company should be discriminated against. This is like arguing that Uber shouldn’t be allowed to use highways that it and the customer has already paid for because people like it too much and it is causing traffic in some bottlenecked areas. Now, the only reason that ISP’s really have to ban Netflix is because they directly compete against them in the content delivery business. This was in reply to Carolinian Reply ↓ Carolinian April 29, 2017 at 5:11 pm Since most ISPs offer flat rate pricing then low bandwidth users who never watch Netflix or other video services are in fact subsidizing the transfomation of the web into de facto cable tv and the activities of those video lovers. This has become much more of an issue with cell tower internet where available bandwidth is more limited. If I’m not mistaken it’s the rise of smartphones and their consumption of video that has really brought this issue to the fore after so many years of net neutrality being less of an issue. To offer a more accurate analogy than your Uber example, electricity is priced according to the nature of the use and so there is in fact a form of “discrimination” in that regulated industry. The truth is that the common carrier designation is a bit of a copout and free speech access to the internet should be part of much more intrusive government regulation. But that of course assumes that we have governments that care about free speech. At any rate what I’m saying is that it’s a complicated issue and not just about ISP greed, no matter how greedy they may be. Reply ↓ hunkerdown April 29, 2017 at 5:35 pm Carolinian, unrealistic analogy. Bandwidth unused is not “saved”. It is, in fact, wasted and lost forever. What, exactly, is the cost difference between a 0% utilized lit fiber and a 100% utilized lit fiber? Aside from a very minor increase in power consumption at either end of the link to handle the information, approximately nil. Shared network media are not comparable to packet-switched network media. A river is a better analogy: use it or lose it, but leave enough for others. We would be far better off if network providers would replace broadcast television “channels” entirely with network bandwidth and stop oversubscribing their internet links to wherever it is their users want to go. That means Netflix traffic gets just as degraded as everyone else when a particular link in the chain is overloaded, and boo hoo for their viewers. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 29, 2017 at 7:06 pm In the neighborhood where I live ATT is in the process of replacing copper lines with fiber so they are in fact making the river bigger just as the power company has to build expensive dams or power plants in response to anticipated demand and that investment is then covered by rate payers. I’m not sure the analogy is wrong. The intent, it seems, is to turn the web into cable tv on demand and if that is where we are going then web becomes a big infrastructure, big investment proposition and commericalization a greater concern. I understand that a lot of this infrastructure is already in place and therefore why not use it, but my read is that much bigger plans are afoot and this may be why the net neutrality issue is now coming to a head. Admittedly this is not exactly what the above post is talking about but perhaps worth discussion. Reply ↓ Joe T. April 29, 2017 at 8:31 pm We’ve seen large orders of magnitude increases of bandwidth as technology developed from T1 to fiber optic wavelength division multiplexing. This occurred in a decade or two. But now we’re incentivizing internet providers to NOT progress, because if we all have fast enough speeds, they lose their cash cow of “premium” extra-cost service. Capitalism works well when the incentives are exactly right. They seem exactly wrong in this case. Reply ↓ jo6pac April 29, 2017 at 8:44 pm I’m not sure what this is about but my butterfly net works real with my with my new tin-foil-hat. Reply ↓ Ian April 29, 2017 at 11:27 pm Yves, I’m in favor of ending net neutrality bc I don’t believe advertising should be protected information. I should have the opportunity to opt out of advertising and pay my mobile network operator $10 more for an ad free internet. I want advertising blocked at the network level and willing to pay. Reply ↓ Olga April 30, 2017 at 12:54 am Not sure this comment makes a lot of sense to me, but… if you think that net neutrality is just about advertising, you may want to read up a bit about what the concept entails. Nothing like solid knowledge to cut through the Orwellian upside-down-speak. Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Pixel 2 Directly Mentioned As Walleye By Engineer During Software Run – Take A Look! By Ramish Zafar 14 hours ago 14Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 8 is a hot topic these days. Information related to the device has started to streamline, giving us a good, initial idea for Apple’s plans for 2017. Along the iPhone 8, Google’s Pixel 2 lineup, is also making rounds in AOSP codes. Today we get an explicit mention for Walleye, but no other concrete details. It’s natural that Mountain View will use the Snapdragon 835 for its latest flagships, but what differentiate features the smartphones will feature, your guess is as good as ours. So head over below and take a look at an engineer talking about the Pixel 2. Google Pixel 2 (Walleye) Surfaces In Engineer Discussion With No Concrete Details If you love big leaks with tons of details, today’s post isn’t for you. The most important details often surface in bits and pieces. Now we find out that Google’s testing software on its Pixel 2 lineup. The company will launch three smartphones this year, internally code-named  as Walleye(Pixel 2), Muskie(Pixel XL) and Taimen(Pixel XXL). The big change this year from the company’s end will be three smartphone, if we consider code names. However, just as information related to prototypes related to the iPhone 8 surfaced earlier, there’s a good chance that Google isn’t sure for final details either. Related How To Enable Two Factor Authentication On Instagram To Protect Your Account The company surprised everyone last year, by announcing the Pixel and Pixel 2 as its first branded flagships. The pair feature an amazing rear camera setup, even though their hardware isn’t much of an eye opener. Google’s strength is software and the Pixels serve as a good option to unite hardware with it. Some of the more interesting rumors related to this year’s smartphones include custom processor. But first, take a look at the image below. Advertisement In today’s leak, engineer David Zuethen discusses running some new code on a s smartphone. There’s a direct reference to Walleye, so you should be on a particular lookout for the name in future leaks. Apart from an explicit mention, no new details have surfaced. The big question related to this year’s leaks to Google is whether the company will make a serious effort towards improving hardware on its lineup. It’s the sole reason why Apple’s hardware software blend works so well and is a critical element to getting the perfect spot with stock Android on dedicated hardware. The Pixel trio will launch in October, if Google follows its schedule for its predecessor. A critical line of upgrade will be the camera this year and waterproofing for the smartphones. In its rushed launch last year, Google missed a lot of details, which the company has promised to improve this year. There’s plenty of time for more information to surface. Till then, stay tuned and let us know what you think in the comments section below. We’ll keep you updated on the latest.

By Jason Ward Friday, Apr 28, 2017 at 12:00 pm EDT 330 Comments Jason L Ward is a columnist at Windows Central. He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! Android is the world's most used mobile OS, and Microsoft is the world's premiere software and platform company. To some, that sounds like a match made in heaven. This is especially true when you consider that Microsoft's current Windows-on-phone OS, Windows 10 Mobile, is fairing just as poorly as its predecessors. Like Pocket PC, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone, Windows 10 Mobile has failed to deliver Microsoft's products and services to the mobile masses. The ideal position for a company that hopes to be represented in the mobile space is that it has a market-accepted mobile platform, integrated first-party products and services, and a robust third-party supported ecosystem. Microsoft only has the second of the three. Even with that, scorned fans will be quick to point out that many first-party Microsoft products, like Office Sway, make it to iOS and Android but never come to Windows phone. Given the state of Windows Mobile and Microsoft's cross-platform commitments, many Microsoft watchers believe that Microsoft should abandon its Windows-on-phone vision and use Android instead. Some would even argue that Microsoft is showing signs of doing just that. Are they right? Microsoft is leeching royally off of Android Despite the competitive challenges it brings to the table, Android has been good for Microsoft. The company collects royalties from various Android OEMs due to a patent licensing agreement. The estimated billions of dollars in yearly revenue these royalties add to Microsoft's bottom line (though dwarfed by Microsoft's core business revenue) are certainly a motivation for Microsoft to hope for Android's continued success. Though, perhaps not to the extent that that success is detrimental to Microsoft's personal computing goals. Additional revenue isn't the only benefit Android provides Microsoft. According to Microsoft's Chief Experience Officer Julie Larson-Green, "Android is a great platform for rapid experimentation." The platform's openness and the vast number of users make it ideal for testing new features. Thus, Microsoft's investments in garage apps such as its Next Lock Screen and Arrow Launcher for Android are not end goals in themselves. The depth to which Microsoft can access the Android OS (compared to the limits of iOS) allows the company to create useful Android apps, which also provide opportunities for tremendous feedback for features that later make it to Microsoft's core products. Larson-Green explained: … [B]y handling it as a separate app first, it means that they won't accidentally ship a half-baked or just user-unfriendly feature to the millions of Windows users out there. This explains Microsoft's Android focus on garage apps. But what of Microsoft's other decisions that some interpret as suggestive of the company's progression toward Android? Becoming Android Concerned Windows phone enthusiasts needn't look far to find evidence that Microsoft is testing the Android waters. Shifts in UI design of Window Mobile from the bold, sweeping, cascading text we fell in love with, to hamburger menus and an Android-esque aesthetic signal that Microsoft is slowly abandoning its unique mobile vision. The explanation that Microsoft was hoping to appeal to Android developers by making Windows phone UI elements more consistent with Android apps didn't satisfy some critics of the decision, especially since Android developers never took advantage of the shift. Microsoft's Windows 10 Companion app may also be interpreted by some as the company's lack of faith in its mobile platform. The app helps smartphone users download Microsoft apps to their smartphones with the hope of integrating those users more deeply into Microsoft's ecosystem. This investment coupled with the often-criticized strategy of exclusively bringing apps to iOS and Android can be seen as Microsoft hedging its bets in case Windows Mobile fails. If Windows phone fails, Microsoft's phone companion app may herald Microsoft's plan B Best on Windows? Some would argue that if this is not the case, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's promise of a "best on Windows Microsoft experience" would dictate a prioritizing of Microsoft apps on Windows. The growing number of Microsoft apps in the Google Play Store (and App Store), while Microsoft fails to bring its own apps to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) causes many to question the company's priorities. The integration of Android with Windows 10 services such as Cortana and notifications also suggests to some that Microsoft may be preparing to abandon Windows Mobile. Cyanogen, Microsoft cozying up with Android Microsoft had a partnership with Cyanogen (which, after a major shakeup is now Lineage, a U.S.-based company that produced Android-based firmware for mobile devices. This partnership, which saw the bundling of Microsoft apps and integration of Microsoft services in the Android-based Cyanogen OS, also suggests to some that the company was testing how well Microsoft products and services might integrate with Android. Former Cyanogen CEO Kirt McMaster was excited about bringing "new kinds of integrated services to mobile users in markets around the world." Microsoft passed on financially investing in Cyanogen, and as Lineage it's no longer the company that entered into a partnership with Microsoft. Despite these shifts, Microsoft gleaned valuable data from the relationship. Deep OS-level integration of products and services like Cortana within the Cyanogen OS undoubtedly helped Redmond to, at least in part, bring a non-Google, Android-based vision of a Microsoft-focused mobile OS, reminiscent of the Nokia X, into view. "Microsoft's" Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung's Galaxy S8 is a beautiful phone, and Windows Central hasn't been shy about acknowledging its appeal. Microsoft, which is offering a Microsoft version of this Android-based phone in its retail stores, where Windows-based phones are ironically absent, also recognizes the phone's consumer appeal. This arrangement may appear to be a sure sign that Microsoft is abandoning its mobile platform for Android. Microsoft's long play, however, even if its mobile platform was a success, would likely entail imbuing competing platforms with its products and services. The controversial positioning of an Android device in a Microsoft Store is harder to defend. But that too could be envisioned as a strategy. Let's not forget, however, that in 2015 Samsung and Microsoft ended a court dispute over Android royalties the Korean-based company was obligated to pay Microsoft. The full terms of the outcome of that case were never disclosed. Perhaps, this Microsoft version of the S8, with a prime spot in the physical store, is part of what resulted from that case. Then again, the Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus Android phone is being sold through the Chinese Microsoft Store. Some might deduce that Microsoft's foray into Android with garage apps and Cyanogen, and its prioritization of cross-platform investments above Windows, suggest that the company is using the S8 and Mi 5s Plus to set the stage for an eventual Microsoft branded Android smartphone in the Microsoft Store. But I doubt it. Few companies have the resources to fork Android, Microsoft is one of them "Forking Android" is when an OEM uses the free Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code to run devices with a Google-less Android OS. Simply put, when an OEM chooses not to use Google's version of Android, official access to the Google Play Store and the suite of popular Google apps and services are not part of the package. Without those value-adding products and services, which have become almost synonymous with "Android," the Google-enriched version is not the Android you get. It is more of a no-frills version in need of a range of products, services and an app store. Companies like China-based Xiaomi and online retailer Amazon used vast resources to succeed with a Google-less version of Android. Microsoft, with its broad range of software and virtual product-for-product alternatives to Google's range of first-party offerings, is arguably well-positioned to fork Android, as well. Through persistent cross-platform offerings of its products and services, Microsoft has potentially positioned itself to be a "first-party" developer of a homegrown Android platform. Additionally, with Microsoft Garage and other original apps, the company has indisputably proven that it can create compelling new apps specifically geared for Android that also integrate with Microsoft's other services. (Arrow Launcher's Office 365 integration is an example.) Forking Android can get complicated One challenge Microsoft would face if it switched from Windows Mobile to Android is another blow to its tenuous relationship with developers. Some developers have suffered through a series of breaks in OS continuity over the years as Windows Mobile evolved toward OneCore. Developers don't love Windows. Can Microsoft mend the relationship? The UWP Microsoft has been promoting OneCore, the UWP and writing code once for all form factors for two years. If Microsoft made an about face and embraced Android, it would likely lose all credibility with developers and many others in the industry who believe in Microsoft's UWP vision. A Microsoft-branded Android smartphone, though capable of integrating with the Windows ecosystem, would cut the mobile component of UWP out of the picture. This can't be Microsoft's plan. Maintaining multiple apps For those developers who may embrace Microsoft's Android, challenges remain. For instance, a developer who buys into Microsoft's platform will have likely also embraced Google's version. Here's the problem: Some apps tie into certain services, like Google Maps, to work. A developer may find that his Google app requires an update but that the same app on Microsoft's platform does not (or vice versa), because of an update to Google Maps (or another service). Thus, in some situations, a developer may feel like he is maintaining an app on two different platforms. What's in Store? A switch to Android would severely impact the already poorly supported Windows Store. Some angry developers would undoubtedly abandon the platform (and Store) outright. Furthermore, Microsoft would have to build an Android Store to serve mobile, while the current Store continues to serve full Windows. After all of the work that has and is going into unifying the Store, I don't envision Microsoft making a move that would damage the infrastructure, logistics and goodwill those efforts established. Obligated OEMs Finally, OEMs that currently build Google-powered Android phones can't embrace building a non-Google Android phone without Google cutting that OEM's access to the Play Store and Google services. Most OEMs would likely stick with the Android services they and their customers know, rather than risking a loss by gambling on Microsoft's version of Android. So should Microsoft fork Android? Despite what some may interpret as indications that Microsoft is moving to Android, I contend that it is not, nor should it. Clearly, a devastated UWP, further damaged developer relations, a chaotic Windows-Android Store duality, and poor OEM support strongly suggest that Microsoft forking Android is a bad idea. I see Microsoft pursuing full Windows-on-mobile on an ARM-based ultimate mobile device. But that's just my opinion. What's yours?

As with any company Microsoft has options, but every choice comes with benefits or costs. I believe that Microsoft's choice to fork Android would come with far greater costs than benefits. Though Windows on phone in it's current iteration is, as it's predecessors, failing in the smartphone space I am confident MS is pursing a Windows on Mobile strategy that will position an ultramobile PC category on ARM w/telephony and CShell in the Mobile space. Android in my view is not a viable option. But what do you say. let's talk!!! 25 1 day ago Reply Pages 1 2 next › last » cdb033 I hope they do not give up.... 27 1 day ago Reply rodneyej I'm with you.... No. Give us W10A/Cshell on a pocketable Surface device.... Build the store back to where it used to be, and market the **** out of it till the lights go out.... Folding will discredit MS as a mobile provider forever. They need to stand their ground, and make it happen. Anything less is BS. 30 1 day ago Reply Tunde Fajimi Word! They need to show commitment and blood in the fight, instead of looking for easy alternate routes. The General can't expect to have allies (or loyal troops) if he (or she) is not willing to risk major stuff (the present conveniences) to win the war, and gain new ground. 8 1 day ago Reply rodneyej Exactly. For a organization of MS's size, and power🙄 it wouldn't look good if they showed they couldn't make a name for THEMSELVES in mobile, wherever that may be.... It's exactly what you say, the easy road out... And, nobody will buy a cheesy Android knockoff MS phone... (There's no way they would be stupid enough to brand this Surface) 2 1 day ago Reply Tunde Fajimi You are so right. Microsoft is too big not to be in the smartphone game, because it is the jump-off point to the next phase of mobile/ultra-personal computing. No shortcuts, MS! Heck, every major mobile tech company is in mobile in one form or the other (Amazon smartly using Echo as well). Even the ones that fell mightily (BlackBerry and Nokia) cannot completely kill of their mobile aspirations (just be much more realistic). But you have to admit that Nokia fought hard! BlackBerry fought too. You can see the blood stains still on them. Microsoft is trying to use their regular stories of "productivity" to point us away from their failure in "mobility" (or rather "ultra-personal computing mobility"). And they killed off Band! Instead of shooting for a next-gen, AR revolution (like their concept videos seem to suggest). Maybe a Surface Band in the future? With MS, who knows... 2 1 day ago Reply rodneyej Yes.. If they can put a man on the moon, then MS shouldn't give up on selling mobile devices.. Just start with world class hardware, and focus on making the mobile aspect perfection... If MS markets "The most powerful REAL computing device on your pocket", and sticks with that pitch, someone will follow, then others will follow.... They have to advertise such a device as fun. Use XBOX gaming, brag about Cortana, show how you can create with PhotoShop on the go, show DJ's unfolding their Surface branded Device, and laying down tracks on the Subway... Run ads showcasing productivity, make deals with major POS sevices, landing deals with McDonald's using these devices to take orders... Show customers siting down in a restaurant, and these devices being used to complete their order.. No more waiting in lines to checkout, because store associates do it with their Surface Phones... Show power. Show things being done that a smartphone can't do!!.... Use hype! Be relentless! Get with the youth showcasing the latest trends using Surface Mobile, and put these devices in the hands of CEO's.. Take your apps back. Have an onslaught of apps exclusive to Surface. Name the app store the Surface app store... Think! Think big! Wake up!!.... Don't be afraid to stand on your own. Bring exclusivity back to Windows!.... SURFACE POCKET POWERED BY MICROSOFT!... STAMP ALL OF THE BEST OF MS BRANDS ON THE BACK OF THIS SURFACE DEVICE! MAKE IT LOOK FUTURISTIC. MAKE IT SUPER APPEALING, AND UNTOUCHABLE, THEN RELEASE THE AFFORDABLE VERSION NEXT YEAR.. MARKET THE **** OUT OF IT! GIVE CONSUMERS NO CHOICE BUT TO NEED THIS! MAKE THE WORLD BELIEVE THEY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THIS! THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FAIL.... MAKE EVERY VERSION MAKE HEADLINES! BUY HEADLINES! IT'S HUGE, IT'S THE BEST FOR ONLY THE BEST.. PUT ME IN CHARGE OF MARKETING, AND GIVE ME A BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET!............ SUCCESS IS THE LAST WORRY, THE BARE MINIMUM THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN OR HEADS ROLL................ GO HARD, OR GO HOME... Damn... Just go make it happen, MS. I'm sick of this non proactive BS. Have some balls MS. Screw Apple, screw Google, and screw the current set of lazy developers... And, screw us fans as well... Do it for MS, and nobody else. Have some self pride, and most of all be confident..... Your slip is hanging, MS. 5 1 day ago Reply rodneyej You know MS needs to send their teams to boot camp.. They need to visit some locker rooms, get motivated... They need a drill sergeant, and a coach.. That place needs to be the darkside, the death star... Nice isn't gonna cut it in 2020... Supercar manufacturers are cut throat. They live on the edge of design, engineering, and performance. It's a super competitive sector of the auto industry.. Yet, every year they make it happen, pushing the boundaries further, and further. They prove that there is more room for just two brands.. Life isn't one size fits all. If I were MS I would take advantage of the fact that there are only two major mobile OS's right now. Take advantage of that instead of running away from it.. Because, if MS doesn't take third now, and compete for second, one day they will be competing for third, or maybe even fourth........ They can't afford to give up third, it's not gonna happen... So, use Android? Hell naaaaw! That's working backwards. 3 1 day ago Reply cheetahwig1 ^ This! MS, hire this guy yesterday! 2 16 hours ago Reply Marco Enxuto Yes! That's what i want to hear it.

The many windows phone fans probably ventured into it because they weren't satisfied with OS' like android and iOS, I know at least I did. While I got into that as well, a few years ago, the windows phone OS was much snappier and actually constantly innovating, working faster, smoother and most importantly had design elements and functionalities that satisfied us Windows fans users. Windows 10 was even more exciting as it seemed incomplete without windows mobile which indirectly ensured Microsoft's commitment to windows mobile. Yes there is an app gap and recently it hasn't been as good as can be recently and android has been becoming more efficient. However, I feel this is a point where we need to support Microsoft even more to return windows mobile to it's prior glory rather than give in to OS' like android or iOS!! 0 13 hours ago Reply SuperJMN Microsoft is not Rick Astley 2 1 day ago Reply Yangstax Nadella already raised white flag in July, 2015.  What credibility?  He only cares about MSFT. 0 1 day ago Reply SvenJ "He only cares about MSFT."

The title however does not provide the answer to that question. Reading the content of the piece does😉 If Microsoft employees were to read the piece, despite Hiswona's desire that they not read our site, they would see that I assert that Microsoft should NOT embrace Android and I provided several reasons why. 😉 Here's the real problem with some of the comments, some folks just aren't reading.😕 24 1 day ago Reply Hans Swolfs True indeed but we also don't want them to start asking that question themselves regardless of the content of your, again written greatly, article Jason 😊 2 1 day ago Reply Jason Ward Thanks Hans, 🙂 but, as with all good decision processes, the option has likely been presented long before this piece. Also given the state of the platform and some suggestions that Microsoft should fork Android, even from some of our readers, I thought it timely to address this question. 🙂 2 1 day ago Reply AbstractKiller Previously I've wished they would read this site, but recently your articles have been full of negativity. Yes, we (the community and insiders) are getting more negative, but you guys are fuelling the acceleration of this negativity with some of the pieces of late.

Microsoft have not said Windows Mobile is gone. They've indicated that insider programme is taking a back seat for now. It stand to reason that the insider programme can never be sustainable. They cannot beta test the OS forever, at some stage they'll have to return to the 3 year release cycle. This realisation will naturally start with their 'smaller' product offering. -1 1 day ago Reply Jason Ward Hiswona, did you read the entire piece, or did you respond in the comments when you "saw the word Android" as you pointed out. If you read this piece im it's entirety you will very clearly see that I am not advocating MS embrace Android. You will see that I actually recommend against it and state that the arguments some may see as reasons that MS may be going in that direction are not indicative of that course at all. If you follow my writings, you will likely see the most optimisitc analysis of the direction I feel MS is going in with mobile (though success is not guaranteed) than you will find anywhere else on the web. 😉 Thanks for commenting, and I hope you get a chance to read the piece thoroughly. Here's my other work: www.windowscentral.com/author/jadon-ward 9 1 day ago Reply Hiswona Did I "read the entire piece"? I read up until the galaxy 8 part. The thing you need to remember is that any publicity is good publicity. If WC continue in this relentless androidification if this site, the better for android. I'll admit Zac is doing it more... And this may be one of your rare articles. If Microsoft research were to do an analysis of WM brand value and came to this site with the hope of finding their users... This would not be helpful as I suspect like most people (as you say) there'd read the headline. -1 1 day ago Reply Jason Ward Hi Hiswona If a Microsoft researcher came to this site looking for the company's users and stopped at the QUESTION the title of this piece asks, without reading the entire article to see the ANSWER, the author provides, Microsoft should fire that researcher for EXTRAORDINARILY poor research skills.😕 The question this title poses is one that many people have posed and I am confident at some point Microsoft has entertained. Good decision making requires looking at all options thoroughly, even unpopular ones, and logically eliminating them by weighing the pros and cons if they are not the most viable choice. By taking the time to read through this piece, your hypothetical researchers would see that I presented first the arguments some may see as reasons why MS is or should choose Android. As a balanced piece I then pointed out the reasons why its a bad idea and concluded by answering the tiltled question with a "no" MS should not ditch WM for Android. Here's some of what you missed by stopping before the end: FORKING ANDROID CAN GET COMPLICATED One challenge Microsoft would face if it switched from Windows Mobile to Android is another blow to its tenuous relationship with developers. Some developers have suffered through a series of breaks in OS continuity over the years as Windows Mobile evolved toward OneCore. Developers don't love Windows. Can Microsoft mend the relationship? THE UWP Microsoft has been promoting OneCore, the UWP and writing code once for all form factors for two years. If Microsoft made an about face and embraced Android, it would likely lose all credibility with developers and many others in the industry who believe in Microsoft's UWP vision. A Microsoft-branded Android smartphone, though capable of integrating with the Windows ecosystem, would cut the mobile component of UWP out of the picture. This can't be Microsoft's plan. MAINTAINING MULTIPLE APPS For those developers who may embrace Microsoft's Android, challenges remain. For instance, a developer who buys into Microsoft's platform will have likely also embraced Google's version. Here's the problem: Some apps tie into certain services, like Google Maps, to work. A developer may find that his Google app requires an update but that the same app on Microsoft's platform does not (or vice versa), because of an update to Google Maps (or another service). Thus, in some situations, a developer may feel like he is maintaining an app on two different platforms. WHAT'S IN STORE? A switch to Android would severely impact the already poorly supported Windows Store. Some angry developers would undoubtedly abandon the platform (and Store) outright. Furthermore, Microsoft would have to build an Android Store to serve mobile, while the current Store continues to serve full Windows. After all of the work that has and is going into unifying the Store, I don't envision Microsoft making a move that would damage the infrastructure, logistics and goodwill those efforts established. OBLIGATED OEMS Finally, OEMs that currently build Google-powered Android phones can't embrace building a non-Google Android phone without Google cutting that OEM's access to the Play Store and Google services. Most OEMs would likely stick with the Android services they and their customers know, rather than risking a loss by gambling on Microsoft's version of Android. SO SHOULD MICROSOFT FORK ANDROID? Despite what some may interpret as indications that Microsoft is moving to Android, I contend that it is not, nor should it. Clearly, a devastated UWP, further damaged developer relations, a chaotic Windows-Android Store duality, and poor OEM support strongly suggest that Microsoft forking Android is a bad idea. I see Microsoft pursuing full Windows-on-mobile on an ARM-based ultimate mobile device." 4 1 day ago Reply Hans Swolfs This is a legit and good discussion imho. A quick summary would come to the conclusion we all agree on one thing : KEEP GOING MICROSOFT!!!👍 2 1 day ago Reply Hiswona Ok, I was wrong. You haven't sold out.

Thanks again. 1 1 day ago Reply Lissandro You do realize that Microsoft could relase an "Microsoftized" Android phone (sorta Like Samsung S8 MS)  to test public reation, while retaining support for their W10M phones. As times go by, eventually W10M would die, and only "Microsoftized" Android phones would remain. Because it's Android, it would not need apdates FROM microsoft, except for their own apps, so DEVs would not feel confused about updates or anything like that, because updates for Google Services would require google updates, and updates for Microsoft Services would require microsoft updates. No confusion, no tricks, no nothing. MS Store would still be a thing in Windows, and as Windows tablets gain marketshare, it's not a bad thing, actually. Many apps fail to deliver in both W10M smartphones and full-fledged Windows 10 PCs, so one focus for DEVs would actually be good.   I bought and Samsung Omnia, with WMo 6.1 back in 2009, then went to a Omnia M in 2012 and finally a L640 in 2015, but we have to face it: Microsoft is losing the battle more and more, and most likely losing money on it. If Microsoft don't do anything strategicaly really smart (I was really looking toward that Surface Phone, with full Windows and stuff, but it seems impossible to came from Microsoft right now), they're done in the phone sector. So YES, I do think that, in the long run, Microsoft embracing Android would be a great idea. 0 9 hours ago Reply kurtd No, but it seems like they already did. 1 1 day ago Reply Adan Brown The answer is no!

As a Surface Pro 4 owner as well, I really do not wish to move away from Windows Phone, but I honestly think the OS is entering it's final phase. I own a Lumia 930, which I see will not be updated to the Creator's Edition, and as I type, there are no Window Phones available to buy anywhere. I've had my 930 for a few years now, and soon, it will need to be replaced, but with what? Microsoft need to either make an announcement about the rumoured Surface Phone, or put us all out of our misery, so we can move on. I'd love to stay with Windows Phone, but if the hardware isn't there, that surely tells it's own story... 2 1 day ago Reply Jf.Vigor I feel you guy. I'm over looking at branding and loyalty to a brand, and simply getting the best device for my needs. Surface is a GOOD device and potentially the best out there in its class. Before I'd get a new surface because, Microsoft. But I dont trust Microsoft anymore. I will be getting a new surface because it's a GOOD DEVICE.   I switched to the s8+ because again, it's a good device. Oh no, I have two different OSes... lol really who cares? In the end I';m happy because I'll ahve two functioning and attractice devices that meet my needs.

Even if that were to happen, the argument for writing a UWP app over a Java-based Android app would likely still be weak. I imagine that an Android UWP API would be slow, buggy, and incomplete for a few years after launch and wouldn't win many developers over. 0 1 day ago Reply TelecomGuy Jason...

I've used all of the phone OSs (iOS, Android, WP, and BB 10) as a business user, not as a entertainment consumer, and IMHO Android is dead last in terms of UI friendlyness. WP is in second place behind BB 10, but clearly ahead of iOS. If MS can get a really workable WM OS, they would have a very viable product. The issue then becomes aggresive marketing of the product. Apple does it, I don't understand why MS can't do it. Also, MS needs to stop pretending that they are the "Be All, End All" since they are not. MS needs to clean up its relationship with developers, as so many other here have clearly stated. Stay away from Android as it is not nearly as good an OS as both WP and WM are. 0 6 hours ago Reply kenzibit Hell NO!!! 6 1 day ago Reply ia_win NO, NO, NO, NOOOOOO!!! 2 1 day ago Reply Hiswona There's no limit.

When a developer in the Microsoft ecosystem creates an app, they have the ability to push it across various Microsoft platforms(Xbox, Hololens, etc). Windows 10 on ARM will be the next addition to this family as this move would keep all the existing developer relationships in tact. From there, its up to Microsoft to take some or all of those Android royalties and re-invest it into new and old developer relationships, product R and D, and marketing of Windows 10 on ARM devices.

Also, where the money is coming from is not short term, that is my point. The revenue stream is coming from cloud and office. Those are perpetual subscription based services. Hence my argument on preparing for the long term. What is short sighted is to think that mobile would have any positive impact on their business in any way in this current generation of mobile computing. They are making this kind of money with zero play in the mobile space. Automation and intelligence is where the money will be. Google, Amazon and MS all know this. Edit: Simple example. I commented this elsewhere in this thread. Let's say for argument that Satya did go all in. Best hardware, software and marketing. Kick a** commercials, common consumer says "Oh, i want that". Drive to store the next day. Checks it out, loves it, goes home to set up. Goes to download Snapchat. "wait, what? It's not there?" then drives to the store later to return it. That does more harm to MS than If the customer never purchased in the first place. Only thing worse than not selling phone, selling phones that get returned.

The company has reportedly signalled that it will be wrapping up its operations in the mobile device market within the next few weeks The news was reported on Twitter by ZDNet reporter Mary Jo Foley, who said that a senior Microsoft executive had told her there was almost no money left in the phone business. Renowned Microsoft commentator Paul Thurrottcorroborated Foley’s report, saying that the wind-down of the company’s phone business is, “expected to be completed by the end of the current fiscal year”. This would mean that Microsoft would halt its operations by the end of June. Windows 10 Creators Update - the best featuresTue, March 28, 2017Windows 10 Creators Update is nearly here - here are some of the best features in Microsoft's newest release The new Paint 3D app makes creating models easier than ever [MICROSOFT] Microsoft revealed its latest financial results earlier this week, with company CFO Amy Hood mentioning "negligible revenue from phones." The reality was even more stark, however, with phone sales falling $730 million for the current quarter from the same period last year.The announcement may not be too surprising, given the waning power of Windows Phone devices around the world.  Microsoft did not even publish the results of its mobile devices division in its last financial results, with no new devices being released as the company finalised its messy divorce with Nokia. Windows Phone now makes up just 0.3 per cent of all smartphones sold across the world in the last three months of last year, according to recent Gartner figures. GETTY The news means no more new Microsoft Lumia Windows Phone devices The ascension of Satya Nadella as Microsoft CEO effectively spelled the end for Windows Phone, as he looked to take the company more towards cloud computing. The company has also been resizing its Windows Phone workforce in recent years, with tens of thousands of employees being laid off back in July 2015. Microsoft also effectively wrote off $7.6 billion concerning its 2013 takeover of Nokia, marking one of the company’s biggest ever low points.  The company also recently downgraded work on its Windows 10 Mobile platform in favour of focusing on building other new hardware instead. The news won’t affect Microsoft’s mobile software rollout, as the company recently revealed more details about the rollout of its most advanced mobile software. The company finally began rolling out Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update earlier this week, marking the latest generation of its smartphone platform. However only a certain number of devices are able to download and install the software, including several Lumia smartphones such as the Lumia 640 and 640XL, Lumia 650, and Lumia 950 and 950 XL devices. The mobile version of Windows 10 Creators Update is available to download now. The download brings a number of mobile-specific features, including better ebook support for reading on the go, a new “Snooze” function for Microsoft Edge tabs, and a smoother way to many Wi-Fi connections on your device. There’s also support for full-colour, updated emojis, better Bluetooth connectivity, and improvements to Cortana that allow you to use your voice to control playback and volume of your music. 2 1 day ago Reply Ejay Lozano Use the software on android and ios since Microsoft if giving their apps to those other competitors.

They don't know that Microsoft probably has posed this very question to itself every quarter for the past 3-4 years. The problem we have today is that we get half-information from Microsoft and the second half is pure speculation in the community. Microsoft creates a separate release branch and hell breaks loose in the community. Creating a separate branch for mobile could mean any of 100 things that they might be doing. As a software developer, you create a branch from the mainline to isolate the branched codebase from BIG changes going on the mainline. It does not mean that these changes are strictly PC or mobile. But it does mean they are big enough that it's probably too risky to include in the current Windows 10 Mobile codebase. To me, Microsoft is probably moving to Windows 10 on ARM which would replace Windows 10 Mobile in a seamless fashion. This is NOT a reboot. With CShell, if you have two phones--one with Windows 10 on ARM and another with W10M, ideally you would not be able to tell the difference. Since you're already on ARM, current apps should work just fine. Everything else (i.e. x86, x64) is emulated. I fault both Microsoft and the Microsoft fan for this. Microsoft needs to be either 100% transparent or not. This 50-50 BS will fuel speculation and uncertainty and some people will jump ship. Once again, Microsoft is not dumb. It's a business, and they have full time employees studying decisions from every angle and how they impact the finances. They also most likely have a roadmap that goes 1-5 years that we don't know about. So you hear a decision and go "WTF?" in the short term, but it would make sense looking at a roadmap. 1 1 day ago Reply skhwoody2201 Absolutely not.

Mobile (the smartphone-mobile and its attendant app experiences and expectations) is not going away as quickly as they'd like, and the "future" is still too far away to become mainstream soon enough. They cannot escape a mobile play in the present (they just haven executed and managed the dev and use communities well), and enterprise (alone) is not going to be a safe heaven forever. I think Microsoft has suffered from some arrogance in thinking they only need to build the platform and not manage the *people* who would interact with the platform. The future paying customers (teens-to-young adults of today) expect digital experiences (in the form of apps) that are not domiciled in monolithic companies but rather creative startups (devs) resident on *platforms*.

They would have the same problem with the lack of apps like in the Win10 Mobile. Microsoft have a problem that they cannot get stuff fast enough feature complete like Google can. I remember 2 years ago, Microsoft was telling us to work with Tiles and WinRT. Later, use UWP. And now they tell us to use Xamarin. And I guess that at Build2017 that they will say use Project Neon. No wonder why Microsoft is having trouble keeping devs. They have nice coding tools and SDKs on paper. But in reality it's always a work in progress. It's not to bad for me since I'm an hobbyist but for someone that those tools are a must for work, it must be like walk in a dense jungle. 0 1 day ago Reply Tunde Fajimi A dense jungle of passionate confusion. Sometimes you was the eyes of the Microsoft staff during presentations and their many on-line shows and programs and they don't seem very enthused themselves. Just biding time. 0 1 day ago Reply Brian Mueller I agree, however, each time they change development, the target became bigger.  From Silver lite Windows Phone only.  Windows Store Apps could target phone and Tablet with high code share,  Same core, different GUIs.  UWP we can target phone, tablet and desktop with full responsive GUIs.  I suspect the next evolution will be UAP (Universal App Platform).  We can target Windows across phone, tablet, desktop, Mixed Reality, and XBox, iOS phone and Tablet, MacOS, and Android. 0 12 hours ago Reply MBY There are several things keeping me from switching to Android, but one of them would be addressed by MS doing a fork: Unless they make major changes, I will probably never trust Google enough to give it access to what I do on my phone. So I would never log in with my Google account (which I do have). Google's treatment of privacy has made it clear over and over again that the user is the product they're selling to advertisers. Many people don't care about this, but I do. MS has responded positively to feedback from consumers about privacy, while Google doesn't even get asked about this stuff. 1 1 day ago Reply laevanay I think MS should ditch Windows 10 altogether and imbrace Mac OS. -2 1 day ago Reply homi101 You should ditch w10 0 1 day ago Reply lumianok smart i kinda disagree. there is only one thing MS should do to bring more developers to UWP: Bring UWP to Android (and possibly to iOS)! I know there are probably lots of technical challenges but still i guess that could bring life to UWP (run apps on windows, windows mobile and android!). THIS should be the ultimate goal of a true UNIVERSAL app platform. If there is a company out there that is capable of achieving this it only can be Microsoft. looking forward to hearing something about mobile at build :) #hopeneverdies 1 1 day ago Reply GhostEchelon That I'm sure be up to android and ios to windows just to go universal platform.

We recommend the OnePlus 3T. Here's why. A lot of Windows phone users these days are switching to Android or iOS. Although that's unfortunate, we understand why it is happening and want to help. We're often bombarded with questions, such as "Which Android should I get?" Let's be honest, the world of Android is far more complicated and vast than the small circle of devices that Windows 10 Mobile currently offers. See at OnePlus In my previous article detailing my experience with Android as a Microsoft user, I decided to do an experiment using the OnePlus 3T. I made that decision after doing research on best Android smartphones, but I wasn't entirely interested in raw specs or the build quality. I was looking for an Android that's best for newcomers to the platform. And that's where the OnePlus 3T comes in. I've been using the OnePlus 3T as my main device for around a month, and I'm yet to regret my decision. I could've picked the LG G6, or waited for the Samsung Galaxy S8. But I didn't. I grabbed the OnePlus 3T, and I honestly do think it's the best choice for Windows phone users looking to make the switch to Android. Here's why. OnePlus 3T Detailed Review Software Android is Android. It's Android on Google's Pixel, and it's Android on the Samsung Galaxy S8. It's also Android on the OnePlus 3T, but each hardware maker does something different that changes things. Some hardware makers clog their phones with unnecessary skins and services. Others implement useful tweaks. And some leave Android alone to be Android. As someone coming from a Windows phone, it was important to me that my experience with the software was the best it possibly could be. So for me, the Galaxy S8 is not an option because Samsung often likes to cake Android in its own skins, added features and services, which ultimately slow down the handset. The LG G6 is less guilty of this, but HTC, Xaiomi and more all do the same. The Pixel is probably the best choice in regards to smooth and responsive Android, but there's a problem: The Pixel is a Google phone, and at Windows Central, most of us are not Google users. We're all in on Microsoft's ecosystem. So buying a phone designed specifically for Google users probably isn't that great of an idea. So what other Android could we use here? Enter the OnePlus 3T. OnePlus doesn't add unnecessary fluff on top of Android. The experience is almost "stock" Android, with a few additions and necessary tweaks that make using the OnePlus 3T better. For example, there's a dark mode on the OnePlus 3T, something that's omitted from the Pixel and Galaxy S8. The OnePlus 3T shipping with mostly-stock Android is significant. There's only the "normal" amount of Google bundleware out of the box, and most of it can be disabled pretty easily. So it's an Android that isn't designed entirely for the Google ecosystem, that's mainly stock Android which means it's super fast and fluid. That also means when you ultimately decide to install Microsoft's own Android launcher, it won't task the CPU as much as it would on other Androids, and overall user-experience is much more positive in the long run. I haven't experienced any lag on the OnePlus 3T. The same cannot be said with my experiences with the Galaxy S7 and other Androids. The fingerprint reader in the home button on the front of the device is also incredibly quick. It's just as fast as my iPhone 7's fingerprint reader and definitely faster than the Lumia 950's iris recognition or the HP Elite x3's fingerprint scanner. Hardware Of course, users coming from Windows phone finally have the chance to choose a smartphone that's well-built. The OnePlus 3T is an excellent device that's well-crafted and reminds me a lot of Surface. It's made of aluminum that feels superb in the hand. Lumia 950 users will really enjoy this build quality. The OnePlus 3T comes in three colors: gunmetal, soft gold, and for a limited time, midnight black, which is what I opted for. The phone is incredibly well-built and isn't too crazy for a newcomer switching from Windows phone. It also uses dedicated hardware keys for back, home and the multitasker. The only criticism I have is that it's rather slippery, so you might want a case. I know many Windows phone users prefer on-screen keys. Don't worry, the OnePlus 3T has you covered. As mentioned above, OnePlus has made several small but necessary tweaks to Android, and one of them is the option to enable the on-screen navigation buttons in favor of the hardware keys. (I still prefer using the hardware keys.) When it comes to specifications, the OnePlus is pretty well-equipped. It's rocking a Snapdragon 821, which I know isn't the latest from Snapdragon, but it does the job well. It has 6GB of RAM, which is more than most other Android flagship devices on the market. Devices like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 are rocking 4GB of RAM, which is also reasonable. But with 6GB of RAM, you can have more apps open in multitasking at any given time, and the OS is less prone to slowing down and lagging when doing multiple things at once. In my tests, it's clear that the OnePlus 3T can hold more apps in multitasking than the LG G6, with the G6 needing to reload specific apps when switching. You also get either 64GB or 128GB storage options. There's no microSD expansion support, unfortunately, which may be a deal-breaker for some. There is dual-SIM however, another must-have for a lot of Windows phone users. Oh, and there's also a headphone jack. The screen is gorgeous. It's a 1080p OLED panel, so it's not the highest quality. But, honestly, at 5.5 inches, 1080p is absolutely fine. The OLED panel is incredibly bright, and the colors simply pop. There's also a sort of glance screen that you can enable, which displays the time and notifications on a black background when you wave your hand over the ambient sensor. The camera is an important factor for many Windows phone users, especially those on Lumias. The OnePlus 3T camera is superb. It's incredibly fast to launch. I'm not much of a camera expert, but I've not been disappointed by the OnePlus 3T's 8MP front-facing or 16MP rear-facing shooters. (For more information on the cameras, I'd refer you to the Android Central review.) Battery There is a USB-C charging port at the bottom of the device, but this isn't any old USB-C charging system. The OnePlus 3T utilizes something called "Dash Charge," which has the tagline "A days power in half an hour." They aren't kidding; the OnePlus 3T charges abnormally quickly. No Windows phone on the planet charges as fast as the OnePlus 3T. In fact, I'd argue that no other commercially-available phone charges as fast as the OnePlus 3T. The 3T is rocking a 3500mAh battery, which gets you through a work day easily. In my daily use case, I can get through a day and a half, sometimes even two, before needing to charge. Price A lot of the time, people looking to switch from Windows phone don't have the money to be able to afford a good, high-end smartphone. This usually means they end up getting a cheap, low-end handset with terrible performance. Considering the OnePlus 3T is rocking a Snapdragon 821, 6GB of RAM, 64GB Storage, dual SIM, a 1080p OLED display and the fastest charging in the world, I'm sure you're thinking this device is super expensive. But it's not. OnePlus is known for building incredibly high-end flagships for a low cost, and the 3T starts at just $439. For $439, you can get yourself the 64GB OnePlus 3T, which comes with all the same goodies that the 128GB variant comes with. The 128GB model is only $479, so it's not much of a jump in price. Now, $439 isn't the cheapest you can go for a smartphone, but for what you get in the box you can't exactly say you're not getting your money's worth. Final thoughts on the OnePlus 3T Based on the fact that the OnePlus 3T ships with almost stock Android, with some additional, useful tweaks such as dark mode, great build quality, incredible specifications, and a relatively low price point, the OnePlus 3T is the best Android phone for newcomers looking to switch from Windows phone. It's not flashy and crazy. It's a good, modest and very capable smartphone. It's a great starting point into the world of Android. You can essentially turn the OnePlus 3T into a Microsoft phone thanks to Android, which is what I love the most about Android. On iOS, you can't really do that. On Android, you can set Microsoft apps as default apps, sync notifications from your phone to your PC, set Cortana as the default voice assistant, and even use Microsoft-made home screens and lock screens. You can essentially turn Android into a Microsoft phone, which is great. Admittedly, it's unfortunate that so many people are looking to switch from actual Windows phones these days. For those who just can't hack Windows phone anymore (I'm still returning), the OnePlus 3T is an excellent best place to start if you're looking to switch to Android.

Everything else is a silly way of judging things. I'm a long time windows phone user and developer but I have to admit highend androids became perfect. The s7edge from which I'm replying is stutter free (nougat) and has 35hrs battery usage. Not to mention how much informative and interactive are widgets if compared to live tiles. And interactive notifications for each app are very enjoyable too. It also opens apps like FB and whatsapp (ie what people mostly use on a phone) 100% faster than my old l950 which is now my mother's phone. I still miss the superior, yet slow, camera of the l950 and the screen was cool too (not as cool as samsung s ).

Even back in 2012/2013 I had issues selling Android because iOS had more quality apps people wanted.

With the Pixel if you are not on car Bluetooth you won't hear any phone notifications. Because of the poor conectivity of the Pixel I moved back to my 950 and it is rock solid.  I don't have to restart the Bluetooth or the phone to get it to connect to my car.  This might make me switch to an iPhone, and I really really don't want to do that.

The OnePlus 3T isn't a good phone even to Android users let alone for people coming from WP (most likely Nokia phones). Here's why people leaving a Nokia Windows Phone or any other Lumia shouldn't go for the OnePlus 3T and get the Galaxy S7 instead (which you can now find for 500€): - Horrible camera on the 3T. For people using PureView cameras, going to the 3T will be a painful experience. Heck, the 300€ Nokia 6 takes better photos than the 3T. The Galaxy S7 on the other hand has the best camera currently on Android (which is the same camera on the S8). - No wireless charging on the 3T. Forget all your wireless charging pads you've had since the Lumia 920. The Galaxy S7 however has wireless charging. AND fast charging if you're a neanderthal who still plugs cables to their phone ;P - No microSD expansion. You'll have to pay more for the 128GB version of the 3T. And once that runs out, it runs out. The S7 has 32GB built in and microSD expansion. - Size. The 3T only comes in one size: very large. The S7 has a normal sized version and a larger version for phablet lovers. - Screen. The 3T has a 1080p screen. The S7 has a 2K display which you can choose to use either at 720p, 1080p or 2K. - IP certification. The 3T has none. The S7 is IP68 certified. - Ecosystem. The T3 has none. The S7 has the Gear VR, the Gear 360, Samsung's smartwatches etc. You'll get access to a much broader ecosystem. Besides, Samsung's Tizen smartwatches are actually better than Google's Android Wear watches. And you won't have to deal with Google there either. - Software. Yes, Samsung is known for their heavy skin of Android. But thing is, if you want to avoid Google's services, Samsung is a much better option than nothing. Besides, Microsoft's suite of apps come bundled with Samsung phones which means you don't have to go through all the work of downloading everything. Besides, stock Android s*cks. On the S7, if you replace the launcher with Nova (or Arrow or SquareHome 2 or any another launcher you want, you can get a far better Android experience) - Customer support. I mean this isn't even a battle. You have the might of Samsung against the small Oppo-owned company that is OnePlus. - Price. The S7 can now be had for pretty much the same price of the 3T. And it's a vastly vastly superior phone. So if you're a WP user looking to jump ship, go for the S7 (because the S8 simply isn't worth the money they ask for it). If you want stock Android and cheap but quality devices WITH expandable storage and good performance for the price, wait for the Nokia 5 and Nokia 6. 4 1 day ago Reply Gabriel Hernandez5 I agree, the S7 Edge's price where I live has been discounted from $850 to $555.  If I was going to purchase a phone in Q2 2017 I would definitely go for the S7 or S7 Edge. -1 1 day ago Reply LondonLumia Most of that can be explained by pricing though - at this price, it can't pack the best of the best. I haven't used one - I really want to, though - so can't speak about customer support or anything but, hey, MS's attitude to their phones ain't exactly great. Screen has a lower resolution, yeah. You could argue it saves on battery and processing power, though. Also, with the storage, 128GB should do *most* people - 32GB can do me, with cloud storage on top. At the end of the day, if you use W10M now, you've accepted compromises already. The 3T has a lot fewer setbacks in the key places where it counts. -1 1 day ago Reply DJCBS - Which is why I would recommend the S7 instead of the S8. The S7 is infinitely better than the OnePlus 3T and currently can be bought for the price of a 3T. Why would you pay the same for a worse phone? ;) - OnePlus support isn't great. I'm not sure how is Microsoft's Lumia support though as I haven't used a Windows Phone as a daily driver since Nokia left. But if it's bad, then yeah, it's probably similar to OnePlus. Except, you know, Microsoft is a huge Corporation and OnePlus (or even Oppo) aren't.   - As I said, the S7 screen can be used on 720p and 1080p. You're not bound to use it in 2K. On the OnePlus 3T, you have no option. - And if you go for the 128GB OnePlus 3T the phone won't be so cheap anymore. On top of that, it's way more convinient for most people to switch the microSD card from one phone to another and have everything there without the headaches of cloud saves or transfer of files.   But that's the point. The OnePlus 3T has TOO MANY setbacks to justify buying it when you can buy far better real Android flagships for the same price. And if you're coming from Windows Phone where you already had to put up with compromise after compromise, why would you go to a phone with also a bunch of compromises when you DON'T NEED TO? It just makes no sense. Zac recommends the 3T because that's what he bought. That's it. If someone where to give him an S7, for example, I'm absolutely sure he'd be retracting this article.   (And, again, I'm talking about the S7 and NOT the S8) 0 1 day ago Reply Kadcidxa I will never buy another cheaply designed Samsung phone ever again. 0 1 day ago Reply DJCBS Please tell me which is the "cheaply designed Samsung phone" you're talking about...considering you think a Moto X is acceptable?

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Apr 30, 2017 - Page 16　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Austria seeks to tax digital services like Google Search Bloomberg Austria is seeking ways to make digital services like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc pay taxes for transactions with the nation’s Internet users, trying to plug gaps in a tax system still designed for brick-and-mortar business. The most ambitious part of the plan targets the business models of Twitter Inc, Google or Facebook: The tacit pact under which searching, liking, posting and tweeting remains free as long as users let the companies feed usage data into algorithms that help tailor advertising to the most likely buyers. That arrangement is a form of bartering, and a value-added tax could be imposed on such transactions just as the levies are extended in other parts of the economy, said Andreas Schieder, the parliamentary head of Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern’s Social Democrats, which govern in a coalition with the conservative People’s Party. “The business transaction that’s going on here is that users are paying with their personal data,” Schieder told journalists. “The business model of those Internet companies is based on massive revenues that are generated with the help of those data.” Raising more taxes from digital businesses is part of a broader plan to amend the nation’s corporate tax code. The package also includes closing loopholes that allow “aggressive tax planning” and corporate tax avoidance, which cost the nation as much as 1.5 billion euros (US$1.6 billion) a year, about a fifth of its annual corporate tax revenue, Schieder said. The Social Democrats’ plan has two other elements targeted at Internet companies: It would extend tax on advertising revenue to digital formats, and it would tax purely digital services that are acquired by Austrian customers from companies with no physical presence in the country. Schieder said the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has made proposals for calculating and implementing such taxes, especially in its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. “We need a new approach to make sure that taxes are paid where revenue and profit is made,” Schieder said. “The OECD has made practical suggestions how to define digital establishments for tax purposes.” The proposals would need the agreement of conservative Austrian Minister of Finance Hans Joerg Schelling.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 67 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares166 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution.

They respond within moments, but that response is always boilerplate like you mentioned. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Charles222 I usually roll with Google auto-creating events in calendar for me like they do, and the random stuff that doesn't float through my email goes to Todoist. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Charles222 Having a few Homes around the house is what pushed it for me. I'll remember some random-ass thing I need to do in the future, and I don't take my phone to bed (or have it particularly nearby generally at home) as a rule...but I do have a Home in the bedroom and just being able to talk to to Todoist to set up an event is fantastic. Scott Scrivens That sounds pretty great. If I get Home I'll definitely check it out. Also "Homes around the house" sounds funny. Maybe Google didn't think the name through. Charles222 haha, yeah, I suppose it does. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. bekifft Pretty sure that one was for example, I doubt his dog's name is actually Fido. I admit it is kind of unlikely you'd get that many reminders in one notification, but it does illustrate the point that Google hasn't quite thought the system through. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v bekifft This happens to me too. Not so extreme, but it seemingly sometimes takes Google quite a while to realize I'm home for reminders. Which is strange because they bloody well know that I'm home, they spend all day burning through my battery to make sure they know where I am at all times. Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. leganzish I have always wanted this for those exact same scenarios. That would be so powerful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Scott Scrivens I have tried Tick-Tick actually, and I seem to remember not liking the UX. It's seems it's had a considerable makeover since then though so I'll check it out again, cheers. Jock Murray I use Business Tasks by Appgenix-software.com I don't think Google realise the importance of their Google Tasks. The ability to nest tasks and have descriptions/comments attached to each task, is critical. Keep users don't know what they're missing out on. Scott Scrivens Looks good, I'll check it out! pantagruel I use Business Calendar 2 with support for Google Tasks built in. Smarter choice if you use your calendar as well. bekifft Since we're recommending apps, this one seems the best, and uses Google Tasks as its back end. Come to think of it, I'm not sure Google Tasks even has an official front end anymore, but Google seems to have forgotten to shut it down. Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splendapps.splendo Scott Scrivens Think I've tried this one before and wasn't overly enamored by the UX, sadly. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 Rafael Reinoldes But it can't handle nested itens :( N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. morrisp Well, it won't appear (or notify you) on the desktop Calendar -- but will still notify you in the Calendar app, yes? N8SLC Yes, morrisp. :) Scott Scrivens Nope. It straight up won't give you a notification at all. It acts as though reminders are turned off altogether. If you set the reminder in another app, those will still notify you. But if you set the reminder in Calendar (app or desktop), and turn the reminder calendar off, you won't get a notification. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. F4LL0U7 If you're talking about reminders set through the Google app, you have to go into the Google app's settings and enable sound & vibration for those notifications. I think they're off by default. ellett Nope, I don't use reminders through the Google app. I do all of my calendar-related operations through Calendar. Putting appointments, reminders, notifications and alarms in different places is just plain wrong. F4LL0U7 Ha, you have a point. It might seem obvious, but you just might want to check and make sure the notification sound is enabled in Calendar also. I think that one might be off by default too. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. iCON You are talking about a company that has six different messengers... Scott Scrivens I'd say it's more about whether it's profitable, rather than whether it's possible. Sad truth. F4LL0U7 There was a recent article on AP (I forget who wrote it) about Google's messenger strategy (or lack thereof) that seemed pretty spot-on. I would bet their reminder strategy is pretty similar. bekifft That, and I don't think they've had a clear reminders strategy from the beginning, and probably still don't. With reminders tied into all these services, it's probably an engineering nightmare at this point. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Naxx ENVY ^ this , his phones on like 5% , hes like . i forgot something , let me check my list ... oh right yea charge phone . Scott Scrivens Because the battery on my Nexus 5X doesn't last the whole day. So a reminder to charge it at around 4PM is useful. I'm not always able to, but if I intend to be out of the house in the evening it's a necessity unfortunately 😩 Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different Scott Scrivens Agree with Luzandro. It's probably the best option but still not as good as the Google app input method. bekifft Yes and ironically the Google app does not yet have any app shortcuts. Add Reminder and View Reminders would be two excellent choices. TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. morrisp The stock iOS Reminders app is indeed buggy -- notifications sometimes don't go off. It's a big problem! I recently switched to using an app called MinimaList for most of my reminders. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like. Scott Scrivens You're right about this, and it does work well enough. I just wish Inbox reminder notifications wouldn't disappear after a random amount of time. Miguel Hernandez I know this may sound blasphemous to some in this community but how about Cortana? It has a widget that show upcoming reminders and easy add reminder button and is cross-device with Windows 10. Antonio Gabbiano Exactly the same thoughts that I have. The fastest way to add a reminder is via shortcut for Inbox. Hanny Yeung Google Reminder as a new separate app in 3...2...1... Btw, I use Loop for my recurring reminders. Good design & usability, plus I can track my habit performance (I saw Vitamins in your calendar and that seems to be a suitable entry for Loop). Everything else are occasional, so they're in Google, created by voice command. Agreed an app shortcut from Google app and a separation of each reminder in notifications would make life easier. Vivek Shah I completely agree with Scott. The reminder options in Google Calendar desperately needs a overhaul. Hope they're reading this. Polyterative Calendar is great but abbandoned by google.. I'm a power user and these annoyances are really bad bekifft I wouldn't say it's abandoned but it's definitely not a core product anymore. They made it to compete with Microsoft and Exchange back in the day, and it was effective at that, but that's not what they care about anymore. So actually yeah, I can see how it is kind of abandoned. _jack_ Tbh, that's why I use another app for reminders and to-dos. I hate this inconsistencies, and a dedicated service for reminders isn't a bad idea (especially when using them extensively). makapav Not to mention there is no option to make the reminder notification more aggressive: intensity, repeat, persistence. vodanium I really miss that, too! Sometimes I want a reminder to really grasp my attention to do the task at the very moment. In other cases, though, it is not an issue to miss the notification for a few minutes/hours - most of the to-do activities are like this. I've been using The Clock app for "hard" notifications, but it is far from being ideal: e.g. it can be used for reminders within one week only, no option for sophisticated recurrences (e.g. bi-weekly), etc. makapav In other words - it's a usability clusterfuck. fnquaso Actually, Google Tasks does have a (hidden) webpage: https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas bekifft I've started using this app specifically for recurring reminders. Not sure whether it's a good thing or bad thing that Google leaves these gaping holes to third party providers, but here check it out: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bleyl.recurrence&hl=en Rafael Reinoldes Not to mention their task management system, We can create a task list in keep, export it to docs and suddenly they were not tasks anymore, while gmail still have a half-baked task functionality that doesn't support remainders, but supports nested items!! Rafael Reinoldes Forgot about the inability to import lists from docs to keep again Rafael Reinoldes Did you said 'chrome'?!? How could anyone set a remainder from chrome? Scott Scrivens Search "add reminder" in Google. As long as you're signed into your Google account you'll get this... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b7f84553cb8c9298712a98dc6a5f355c79fb13f00154d89a39eaa785046cdab9.png Rafael Reinoldes Not working here, even in an anonymous tab, probably only available in US, tested in android and desktop from Brazil. Scott Scrivens Interesting. I'm in the UK and it works for me. Maybe not everywhere though. Sorry to get your hopes up. You are signed into Google right? Rafael Reinoldes I am logged into google, mainly, because I get a lot of value by syncing stuff across different computers. Scott Scrivens That's annoying, not sure why it wouldn't work in Brazil :( Nathan Type "add reminder" in the Chrome address box. I do it all the time on my PC because it is faster than picking up my phone, but I was also experiencing problems with notifications for reminders set in Chrome not appearing on any of my devices. Now I know why. Rodrigo Chiong It's true that the reminders situation a mess. But I do see a launcher shortcut to add reminders from Inbox that work alright. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dc3b51117bfc2b134dc2fdf28b442f4389a3730166e304ee5ae2969fbe776d83.png Scott Scrivens This is true, and it does work pretty well. The only issue is that, as others have pointed out, Inbox reminder notifications seem to disappear after a little while. I like to leave my reminder notifications in the shade until I get to them. Rodrigo Chiong Well that's also true. You never know if the notification will come from Calendar, Keep, Inbox or the Google app and they all behave differently (particularly the snooze feature) KB You don't need "add reminder" in the search box, just typing "reminder" is sufficient. Dan While adding a reminder in chrome only allows times in 30 minute increments, there is a workaround for at least this part: include the specific time (and optionally the actual reminder text itself) in your 'add reminder' search: 'add reminder 7:40pm' will pre-fill the time for you (although changing the time will still only allow the 30 minute incremented time values) or just search the entire reminder: 'add reminder take out the trash at 7:40pm' or 'remind me to take out the trash at 7:40pm' hopefully this helps someone else Scott Scrivens Great find. As a way of crowdsourcing fixes this is proving very worthwhile. Chris Sanner lessee....what else about reminders bugs me - 1) if you want to dismiss a recurring notification early one dya your only option is to dismiss it *forever* 2) no "repeat x time after completion" option. this is the thing that most keeps me on other todo apps. I might not replace my furnace filter ON THE DAY it's due - but I want to be reminded again a month after I *DO* replace and dismiss it. Joe Dink AMEN! So true! It's pathetic. On such a good platform, otherwise. Chris I agree the reminder system has some shortcomings. I was frustrated recently when the assistant had all but removed entering a reminder by typing if you're in a situation where you can't use your voice. So, I wrote this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccwilcox.quickreminders Its shortcuts to create Google reminders. I depend on reminders, as well Scott Scrivens That looks really useful. Incompatible with my 5X though sadly... Chris Not compatible with the 5X? I'll look into that asap and fix that... Scott Scrivens Let me know when you do, I'll give it a whirl. Chris What country are you in? Are you in the US? Currently, I have the Play Store distribution set to US only for compatibility with Google's app service Scott Scrivens Ah, that's why...I'm in the UK. Are you able to expand the distribution to here? Chris I've enabled the UK and Canada along with the US. Let me know if it works! It may have quirks but lets see! Scott Scrivens Just had a quick play with it, it's really cool! Things I would change/add (if you care to hear them): 1. Blue instead of green (I just hate lime green personally, it reminds me of too much of pre-Holo Android). Add a custom themer even if that's not loads of work. 2. Simple "Add reminder" option, without a predefined time. 3. Hitting X should close app altogether rather than just minimise. Add settings to the top of the expanded options rather than floating at the bottom. 4. Move "Remove ads option" further up out of the way. It's too prominent. 5. Key not available in my country, so add UK and Canada to that too! Those are just my two-pence, though I realise it's all subjective :) Chris Thank you for the feedback! I began building a theme option to set different colors. Many people would probably like that. I'll be happy to credit you on the app page when I post the next update. Scott Scrivens Thanks, that would be an honour. Always happy to play around with new apps. Let me know when you update. F4LL0U7 I recently got Android Wear 2.0 on my GWR, and noticed that I don't even receive reminders on there anymore! I set all my reminders through Google Now, and last night I got a monthly reminder at 9pm on my phone. Nothing at all showed up on my watch. I navigated to the Reminders app on my watch, and the recurring reminder was in the list, but it showed zero current reminders. WTF! Seems like this might be a leftover bug from AW 1.x, where I would receive reminders right on time on my watch, but they were not actionable. If I tried marking one as done, it would think for a few seconds, and then I'd get the frowning cloud icon saying I wasn't connected. But I WAS connected, damn you Google! Josh A The app shortcuts u said Google should add on the home screen can be added to the home screen by holding on the icon again. For example, look at the pic added https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ae1ec39a9aa7517f5e7184c8e8332418e71499a85ea1c56450445ad292f0ba61.png Scott Scrivens What I said is that the Google app should implement similar app shortcuts. Patrick O’Hara To me, the issue isn't getting reminders into the device. The issue is that there is only 1 type of reminder and it's easy to miss. There should be multiple reminder types. Silent, visual, audible, and urgent, for example. I've set lots of reminders that I never got because my volume was turned down. myssi GIVE ME REMINDER WITH DURATION!! Trip66 To find all your reminders all you have to do is say Okay Google show me my reminders and scroll the list the most recent ones are usually on top I've never had any problems finding them. Devin Quesenberry Scott, hang in there pal. You're not alone in your struggle. I've been trying to find a digital solution for my non-scheduling mind since the Trapper Keeper days. Some days I still have to carry around pen and paper, but I'm grateful for google reminders nonetheless. When Inbox came out I signed up because I liked the idea of merging my to-do list with my email (I wish Google would capitalize on this more, but it seems to me that they are starting to take the shotgun approach to development in general). However, I still find myself needing other apps like Keep and Onenote to get the job done. Reminders help me compartmentalize the many hats I have to wear between work, home, and volunteer life, so DO NOT APOLOGIZE for having reminders to do basic things like charge your phone, use the bathroom, or bathe every once in awhile. I even have reminders to check in on my mom from time to time (i.e. reminders to be a decent human being). Loved this article. Fong Yang I'm also a heavy user of reminders and I see the same problems. I hope Google fixes this soon. bekifft You're not alone, I would have written almost exactly this article if I could find the words. I've come to most of the same conclusions you have. Keep is by far the best way to handle reminders through Google, as it's the only one that lets you specify an arbitrary location at which to be reminded. The reason reminders haven't been added to Google Home yet is likely precisely because of this mess. God only knows what it looks like on the back end. Andrey Balandin You're very right in pointing out these deficiencies and I totally support that the experience is inconsistent. However, to be fair you are not using the right view in the calendar for your purposes. There is value in having one app which can show you all of the reminders created by all different methods together with other events and calendar is a good place for this, isn't it? To avoid this cluttered look which makes the calendar unusable you should just switch to schedule view. Scott Scrivens But the month view is how I use Calendar. I like to have an overview of my activity for the whole month. I don't think I should have to change my behaviour because Google is unwilling to hide upcoming recurring tasks in Calendar. YuCMi You forget that Google's business strategy is to have clones of each of their products. Rob It's worth adding that you can only add a reminder using the Google app if you have Google Now cards activated (I don't, because I find it otherwise useless).

Since that can land you in jail, try decompressing with a look back on some tech news you may have missed. Technology for good Let's start with the good. These startups are tackling addiction in an effort to destigmatize it and pioneer new ways of prevention and treatment. They're using machine learning, apps, and online support networks to offer modern alternatives to AA. Meanwhile, Monday was Holocaust Remembrance Day, and while technology can't replace human beings, the USC Shoah Foundation is coming pretty close. It's working to preserve Holocaust survivor stories for future generations by using 85-year-old survivor Pinchas Gutter as a prototype. And Google sent 5,000 public school kids to see "Hamilton" the musical, and visit Alexander Hamilton, the person's, past in virtual reality. Technology for weird Flying high off the success of its Echo assistant, Amazon announced another piece of hardware for the home. The Echo Look will use cameras and machine learning to give you fashion advice. It could be a win for anyone who likes their clothing affordable, bland and shipped in two days. It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a...vertical takeoff & landing vehicle? It was a big week for flying cars, which are not actually flying cars but "vertical takeoff and landing vehicles." Unfortunately, VTOL is hard to say, so here we are. Uber announced plans to launch a network of flying cars by 2023. Meanwhile, Google cofounder Larry Page showed off a prototype of the Kitty Hawk Flyer, his own not-really-a-flying-car that is expected to go on sale this year. Drama, on-demand Uber is still fighting a lawsuit from Google's Waymo over self-driving car tech. The Uber exec and former Googler at the center of the suit, Anthony Levandowski, will step aside as head of Uber's self-driving division until the matter is settled. Meanwhile, Waymo announced that it is looking for Arizona passengers to start testing rides in its self-driving SUVs and minivans. Back in the present, on-demand cars driven by humans are still big business. China's Didi Chuxing is about to be the second most valuable startup at an astounding $50 billion, right behind Uber. Two of the smaller ride-hailing companies are joining forces. Gett is buying Juno for $200 million, angering Juno's drivers who were promised equity. Juno marketed itself as the driver-friendly option, but it's increasingly looking like there is no such thing. And for the weirdos still driving their own cars, on the ground, a new Google Maps tool will help you remember where you parked. Earnings-palloza There were a bunch of public tech companies in the spotlight this week, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Twitter. Amazon is creeping closer to $1,000 a share, while Google is finally making money off of things that aren't ads. Microsoft is cashing in on its LinkedIn acquisition, and Twitter shocked everyone by adding 9 million users in the first quarter. No word on how many are bots. Meanwhile, in politics Silicon Valley's number one Trump supporter, Palantir founder Peter Thiel, has been oddly quiet for the past 100 days. Net neutrality, which Thiel previously supported, is back in the spotlight as the FCC renews efforts to roll back restrictions. Tech companies are gearing up for another battle to keep the rules in place -- which, they argue, keeps the internet open and fair. Facebook admitted it has a propaganda problem, and it has a plan to stop governments from using the social network to tinker with elections. CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to totally not run for office with staged photos at an auto plant. But at least he's not humble bragging about concerts he's seen. Until next week, we leave you with the uplifting words of Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi: "Hopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year."

It’s working to preserve Holocaust survivor stories for future generations by using 85-year-old survivor Pinchas Gutter as a prototype. And Google sent 5,000 public school kids to see “Hamilton” the musical, and visit Alexander Hamilton, the person’s, past in virtual reality. Technology for weird Flying high off the success of its Echo assistant, Amazon announced another piece of hardware for the home. The Echo Look will use cameras and machine learning to give you fashion advice. It could be a win for anyone who likes their clothing affordable, bland and shipped in two days. It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s a…vertical takeoff & landing vehicle? It was a big week for flying cars, which are not actually flying cars but “vertical takeoff and landing vehicles.” Unfortunately, VTOL is hard to say, so here we are. Uber announced plans to launch a network of flying cars by 2023. Meanwhile, Google cofounder Larry Page showed off a prototype of the Kitty Hawk Flyer, his own not-really-a-flying-car that is expected to go on sale this year. Drama, on-demand Uber is still fighting a lawsuit from Google’s Waymo over self-driving car tech. The Uber exec and former Googler at the center of the suit, Anthony Levandowski, will step aside as head of Uber’s self-driving division until the matter is settled. Meanwhile, Waymo announced that it is looking for Arizona passengers to start testing rides in its self-driving SUVs and minivans. Back in the present, on-demand cars driven by humans are still big business. China’s Didi Chuxing is about to be the second most valuable startup at an astounding $50 billion, right behind Uber. Two of the smaller ride-hailing companies are joining forces. Gett is buying Juno for $200 million, angering Juno’s drivers who were promised equity. Juno marketed itself as the driver-friendly option, but it’s increasingly looking like there is no such thing. And for the weirdos still driving their own cars, on the ground, a new Google Maps tool will help you remember where you parked. Earnings-palloza There were a bunch of public tech companies in the spotlight this week, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Twitter. Amazon is creeping closer to $1,000 a share, while Google is finally making money off of things that aren’t ads. Microsoft is cashing in on its LinkedIn acquisition, and Twitter shocked everyone by adding 9 million users in the first quarter. No word on how many are bots. Meanwhile, in politics Silicon Valley’s number one Trump supporter, Palantir founder Peter Thiel, has been oddly quiet for the past 100 days. Net neutrality, which Thiel previously supported, is back in the spotlight as the FCC renews efforts to roll back restrictions. Tech companies are gearing up for another battle to keep the rules in place — which, they argue, keeps the internet open and fair. Facebook admitted it has a propaganda problem, and it has a plan to stop governments from using the social network to tinker with elections. CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to totally not run for office with staged photos at an auto plant. But at least he’s not humble bragging about concerts he’s seen.

Whenever external IP address of PC changes, a new row will be added to Google Sheets. I have listed a very easy tweak that you can perform on your PC to make log of IP changes in Google Sheets. In the following tutorial, I will use a freeware, TrueIP that can do this in an easy way. Additionally, to save the log in Google Sheets I will use IFTTT to make the log in Google Sheets of IP changes. There is a feature in TrueIP that it can send you emails whenever the external IP of your PC changes. I will use this feature to send an email via specific subject. And then using IFTTT, I will create a trigger, based on the subject of incoming email. And when the email with the specified subject is encountered, then the email body will be synced to the Google Sheets for which you have created the trigger. Sponsored Links At this point, you should have understood what it takes to log IP address changes in Google Sheets. So, let’s see the whole process of doing that in more details. How to Log IP Address Changes in Google Sheets? IFTTT stands for “IF This Then That”, it is an online service that has various applets in it which get invoked by detecting changes in other web services like Facebook, Gmail, Pinterest, etc. And one of the applet in IFTTT is syncing emails with Google Sheets. You can can create an applet in IFTTT and use your Gmail account to sync mails that have a specific subject. Follow these simple steps to log IP address changes to Google Sheets: Step 1: Download TrueIP from this link and install it on your computer. After installing you will be able to see its tray icon. Right click on the tray icon and open Options window of TrueIP. See the below screenshot. Step 2: Now, from the options window, check the E-mail me option and click on Email Setting button. Now setup the email settings by specifying various parameters such as sender’s email address, receiver’s email address, SMTP settings, SMTP port,  and subject. While specifying the subject, make sure to pick a specific subject, and you will have to add this subject in IFTTT. After specifying all these, hit the Test Settings button and after success, hit the OK button. Step 3: Open IFTTT website from this link. If you don’t have an account, then create one and proceed. Now find the “Automatically Sync Gmail Emails To a Google Spreadsheet” applet, and select it. After that, it will ask for the permission to access your Gmail and Google Drive. Simply, allow it and proceed. Step 4: Now, a page will appear, where you have to configure the applet. Specify the subject for the incoming mails that you want to monitor. Next, specify the spreadsheet name and path (optional). After all set, click on the Save button and you are done. From now on whenever TrueIP will detect any changes in the external IP of your PC, it will send you an email notification with the same subject that you have specified during step 2.  And when this email arrives in your Gmail inbox, then IFTTT applet will get triggered, and as a result, it will sync the email to the Google Sheet that you have specified. So, in this way you can easily log IP changes in Google Sheets. IFTTT and TrueIP freeware makes it pretty easy to do that. Conclusion In the tutorial above I have explained how to log IP address changes to Google Sheets. And to do that, I have used TrueIP freeware and IFTTT. I really like the role of IFTTT as it (almost) immediately syncs the email notification to the Google Sheet. So, if you are looking for  ways to log IP address changes in Google sheets, then this tutorial will be useful.

Tech Search Search UberYour Next Gig: Taming Travis Kalanick? Yik YakYik Yak Officially Calls It Quits AirbnbAirbnb Will Let California Screen Some Hosts For Racial Bias donald trump presidencyPeople’s Climate March Fills D.C. Streets On Trump’s 100th Day Best Companies 3 Reasons Google Is Crushing It Jeff John Roberts Apr 29, 2017 It's been a good quarter for tech and a very good one for Google. On Thursday, its parent company, Alphabet, posted earnings that beat analyst expectations, helping lift its share price 6% for the week. This is remarkable because, not so long ago, Google looked like a company that was running out of gas. Its core search business looked like it was on the road to stagnation, and investors had grown impatient with its money-losing "moonshot" bets on futuristic technology. So what explains Google's great quarter? One way you can look at it has (for now) dispelled three big worries that were hanging over the company. Here's a summary: 1. Google fixed its mobile advertising problems Desktop search ads are a money machine for Google, but the market for them is mature. Meanwhile, mobile ads presented a problem because the screens are small and brands won't pay as much. This led some to fret that Google's longtime growth story was coming to an end. So much for that. As the Wall Street Journal reported: “The biggest contributor to growth was mobile search,” said [the company]. As it did during its last earnings call, Google emphasized how fast mobile shopping—fueled by mobile search—is growing in particular. [CEO Sundar] Pichai cited the example of the retailer Williams Sonoma, which he said enjoyed a 70% increase in mobile sales year over year. Meanwhile, it appears ad revenue from YouTube is growing quickly as well—meaning the desktop slowdown is not such a problem for now. 2. Google's "other" category is no longer a black hole Google dabbles in all sorts of other businesses—cars, drones, robots, and smart cities, for example. But while such projects far-out there were a scientist's dreams, they were an investor's nightmare. The arrival of chief financial officer Ruth Porat in 2015, however, has meant new fiscal discipline on the so-called "other" businesses. While "discipline" in Google's case means the moonshots are losing less money, the latest earnings call also brought a new form of good news: Google is now making real money from something besides search. "The business, categorized as "Other Revenue" in its earnings report, posted a 49.4% jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday—an amount that is already bigger than Twitter's annual revenue. The business now represents about 13% of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10% a year earlier," notes a Reuters report, which points to revenue from things like Pixel phones and cloud computing services for business customers. 3. Antitrust and Ad Controversy Worries Recede Google's negative nellies have warned that the company risks running into antitrust actions, or a financial backlash over its ads appearing on extremist or hate sites. But neither of these threats look very dire right now. On the regulatory front, it appears the Trump Administration is uninterested in enforcing antitrust rules much at all. It's only slight hyperbole to say in this political climate that Google could get approval to acquire both Facebook and New Zealand. And as for the ad controversy—which recently led some brands to vow they would pull their money from Google—it doesn't appear to have affected Google's finances. It's likely that the company's vow to do more to police its ads, along with news of big changes to its search algorithm, has placated advertisers for the time being.

By Jake Swearingen Share Facebook iconShare Twitter iconTweet LinkedIn iconShare Google Plus iconShare Email iconEmail Comment iconComment Print icon Print Siri was probably the last smartphone feature that convinced me to buy a new phone, even though the one I was using was working fine. In late 2011, when Siri was introduced, I had just accepted a job in Los Angeles, and was psyching myself up at the prospect of spending a lot of time in my car. The idea of having this little, helpful friend in my car that I could talk to — get directions, send texts, check traffic — while I kept my eyes on the road was tremendously appealing. Early commercials were enticing enough that around the same time that I bought a used Honda Civic, I grabbed an iPhone 4s. In reality, of course, Siri didn’t really work like that. Text messages that went beyond a few words were usually garbled. Apple Maps was a mess and didn’t have the actual real-time traffic information you need to navigate Los Angeles, so I ended up just typing wherever I was going into Waze, regardless. Its knowledge base was thin; its understanding shallow. Connectivity was important: Sometimes, it seemed like Siri couldn’t connect to Apple’s main servers, rendering Siri apologetic and useless. I soon grew tired of Siri screwing up, and stopped using it, except occasionally to place a phone call while driving. Things in the past five years should have gotten better, and in a lot of ways they have. Voice assistants on phones began to take off about the same time neural networks started being used, and voice recognition on Siri and its rivals — Google Assistant chief among them — is markedly better than it was just a few years ago. Bixby, a new voice-activated phone assistant rolled out by Samsung with its Galaxy S8, will also soon be able to accept voice commands (voice recognition is currently unavailable, and it’s not clear when it will be). In a demo shown off to a small group of reporters, a Samsung employee rattled off somewhat complex operations in natural language that Bixby will ostensibly be able to follow, e.g., “Send all my pictures from Barcelona to my mother.” Of course, the demos for these things are always impressive — people are always working out complex dinner plans on the fly, or filtering all their photos from a cool vacation. In the real world, Siri and Google Assistant work very well for certain things — setting timers, sending short text messages, asking simple questions — and are terrible at others. Plus, there’s the social aspect of all of this. Perhaps in ten years, we’ll have ascended to Spike Jonze’s Her-esque levels of acceptance, where guys with very high-waisted wool pants can wander around talking to their phones in peace. But right now, using Siri or Google Assistant in public, and making sure it understands me, requires that I use a certain tone — semi-stilted and not quite natural — that just makes me feel like a weirdo. And I don’t think I’m the only one. This isn’t a new problem; tech reviewers, and consumers, have been noting how awkward it is to use Siri and its peers for the last five years. What’s odd now is that there is a popular gadget that no one seems to mind talking to. I have an Amazon Echo that gets daily use in our house that I am quite fond of. It’s guilty of all the things I was just kvetching about. It doesn’t always understand what I’m trying to say; I have to talk to it in a weird voice, almost like I’m talking to a dog or a small child; and in many ways, it’s severely limited in what it can do compared to Siri or my Google Assistant. But I talk to the Echo a lot more, and it’s not just because I don’t feel like a weirdo. It’s because it’s actually in a place to be useful. We need something that can set timers for cooking; play music or the radio while we’re making breakfast or dinner; and order items off Amazon while I’m thinking about the fact that we don’t have any more Mrs. Meyers dish soap, instead of just hoping I remember later that day. I’m not alone in this. Asking around, I found even generally tech-friendly people were in the same boat: They didn’t really use Siri or Google Assistant, except maybe to set a timer or alarm, and only in the privacy of their own homes. The one person I could find who said they used Siri a lot, a content strategist in Chicago, said it was mainly at home. When I asked him if he used Siri in public, he IMed back: “Sometimes, but it certainly feels weird. Especially if it fails to get the request right the first time. There’s something weird about repeating yourself to a voice assistant versus a human who can’t hear you over noise.” So, then, a working theory on why I (and a lot of other people) don’t really want to talk to Siri or any other AI on our phones, but plenty of people have happily adapted to Alexa or a Google Home. There’s a social cost in the form of feeling like a dorkus malorkus when you use your phone’s voice assistant in public, and right now, those assistants can’t do enough useful things reliably and consistently to make it worth paying that cost. And because our phones offer another way to do those useful things without speaking — check train times, look up a recipe, caption and share a photo on Instagram — there may never be any inflection point in the future where we start talking to our phones as a primary or even secondary way to do most tasks. Alexa and Google Home may fall short on competency at times, but they both open up another way to do useful things that wasn’t really available before and don’t incur any social cost. The smartphone suddenly gave you the digital world in your pocket, available at the tap of a finger. The AI home speaker suddenly opened the possibility of talking to your home in a way that felt both futuristic and familiar. But maybe we’re content with just sticking to tapping away on our phones in public, and only speaking to our gadgets in private.

What We Use, 2017 Edition: The stuff Corbin can't live without Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 8:26am PDTApr 28, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Features What We Use Series Article Contents 1 Hardware 1.0.1 Phone: Google Pixel 1.0.2 Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 1.0.3 Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' 1.0.4 Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') 1.0.5 Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) 1.0.6 Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 1.0.7 Smart speaker: Google Home 1.0.8 Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE 1.0.9 Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 1.0.10 Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock 2 Software 2.0.1 Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) 2.0.2 Signal Spy (Android) 2.0.3 InputMapper (Windows) 2.0.4 Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) 3 Conclusion You may recall Android Police's long-running 'What We Use' series, where the fantastic people that work here share the tech (and sometimes non-tech) products they use on a frequent basis. I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police!

It looks fantastic :) Corbin Davenport Gladly! http://www.ebay.com/itm/First-Order-Trooper-vinyl-decal-sticker-STAR-WARS-Force-Awakens-/171760424579 EcE Any particular reason your smartwatches stopped working? I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. JasonIvers Just use Cloudflare... They provide SSL, as well as DDOS protection, etc, for free. It takes basically no work, or even much knowledge, to set it up. Then, if you want to do your own later, you can, but people will be able to use https on the mean time. Artem Russakovskii We already do use Cloudflare, including their SSL, but it's not so simple with our setup for reasons I don't want to explain. We made it work on apkmirror already, and AP is coming. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Da Fuq Agreed, but it's gonna be pretty expensive. New CPU, MB and DDR4 RAM. JD Still cheaper than an Intel setup. Once you consider the performance gain you can't afford to not upgrade Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers. Michael Hazell Must be nice to be able to afford expensive devices like the Pixel. I maintain my stance that there really hasn't been a successor to the OnePlus One since its inception because no future model has come to its price point.

We all have to agree that the new Google Pixel phone is a great device, the one that all fans have been expecting for years now. We also got some powerful and also beautiful devices within this period, but the newest Google device is still getting enough attention. According to many analysts, you can even call it the super Android phone that everybody needed. But besides this excellent model, Google will also release two other variants of the flagship phone, a decision that had many people wondering. Is It Worth It? You might be asking yourself why is Google doing this, since it already has a successful device. And indeed, there are some differences between the original Pixel phone and the Pixel XL one. But this is not the first time the tech giant decided this. Last year they have also launched the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. How Is It Different? The new Google Pixel has a similar design to the Apple devices, according to some. The back will present a glass and metal finish, and the antenna will be placed at the button. One main change is the fact that the fingerprint sensor is quite huge. It will have an AMOLED screen with a 1920×1080 pixel resolution, paired with a crisp display. Regarding the performance, it will run on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 CPU, together with 32 GB internal storage and 4 GB RAM. You will also have the chance to choose the 128 GB version, which is truly awesome. The downside here is that there is no microSD slot included, so you can’t expand the storage. The phone also brings a 12.3 MP camera on the back, complete with larger microns. This translates to better quality photos even in low-light conditions. The front camera is an 8 MP one, excellent for selfies.

In 2016, he had received a salary of $650,000, which is a little less in comparison to the $652,500 he had received in 2015.

S V Krishnamachari   April 29, 2017 20:05 IST Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, US October 4, 2016Reuters file Sundar Pichai, the India-born CEO of Google, saw his compensation almost double to $200 million in (calendar year) 2016, the spike coming mainly from stock awards. Interestingly, his salary actually was lower when compared to 2015. Pichai, who was appointed as CEO in August 2015, received $650,000 in salary and $198.7 million in stock award in 2016, in comparison to $652,500 in salary and $99.8 million in stock award. The compensation committee of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, said that the compensation was paid keeping in mind Pichai's elevation and "numerous successful product launches", reported the CNN, citing regulatory filings by Alphabet Inc. Alphabet's net revenues (net of traffic acquisition costs) income for 2016 was $73,479 million and was projected at $86,669 million by Nomura analysts in a note last month. Net income came in at $19,478 million last year (2016) and estimated at $23,062 million for 2017. Under his leadership, Google's sales buoyed, especially the the core advertising and YouTube business, apart from investments in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing. Google's "other revenues" comprising hardware and cloud services, rose almost 50 percent to $3,095 million in the quarter ended March 2017 (Q1) from $2,072 million in the corresponding period last year (2016), according to statements put up on Alphabet's website. Overall revenues for the quarter rose 22 percent YoY to $24.75 billion for Q1 while the net income was $5.42 billion, up from $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2016. "Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017, with revenues up 22% versus the first quarter of 2016 and 24% on a constant currency basis. We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet," Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, said. It may be recalled that ad revenues of YouTube were perceived as taking a huge hit in view of advertisers pulling out over placement of offensive content along with advertisements on the video-sharing website. "While we believe YouTube is indeed capable of introducing solutions that remedy brand safety concerns, we anticipate the direct cumulative negative impact to revenue could ultimately approximate $750 million, weighted heavily to 2Q17 and 3Q17," Nomura analysts Anthony DiClemente and Kevin Rippey had said in a note last month.  YouTube unveils their new paid subscription service at the YouTube Space LA in Playa Del Rey, Los Angeles, California, United States October 21, 2015.Reuters file Post Comment IBT TV Close Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigns after referendum loss Why advertise with us?

The programme aims to inspire new wave of entrepreneurs and startups in emerging cities like Pune, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Kochi, Indore, Nagpur, Nashik, Madurai, Kanpur, as well as Kolkata and Chennai. Speaking about the initiative, Karthik Padmanabhan, Program Manager Lead for Google India, said, "Majority of India's Internet users are Indian language users, and over 80 percent of them access the Internet from their mobile phones. But the current Indian startup ecosystem is building products for English speaking audience and caters only to 15% of the population. There are growing number of entrepreneurs in smaller Indian cities who are focusing on building solutions that caters to the real needs of India. Through this initiative we want to bring the best of Google under one program and join forces with them to help create solutions that serves the needs of a billion Indians." Developers and entrepreneurs will get access to a variety of Google programmes, including the Google Launchpad mentoring programme which will help them to build, scale and accelerate early stage product ideas, and take them to the next level. The Launchpad accelerator program comes with six month mentorship program along with $50,000 (roughly Rs. 32 lakhs) equity-free investments. Google says it will also provide over $20,000 (roughly Rs. 12.8 lakhs) of Google cloud credits. Developers will have the opportunity to lear from the experts in across the areas of Android, Firebase, Machine learning, Cloud APIs, Progressive Web Apps, and Indian language translation solutions.

Owens Published: Apr 29, 2017 4:31 p.m. ET Share Head of Alphabet’s largest division made nearly $200 million in 2016, twice as much as any CEO tracked in the past two years Getty Images Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai received $199.7 million in total compensation in 2016, Alphabet reported Friday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Alphabet Inc. awarded Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai nearly $200 million in total compensation in 2016, more than twice as much as any CEO of a publicly traded company tracked in the last two years. In its annual proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed Friday, Alphabet GOOGL, +3.71% GOOG, +3.63% revealed that Pichai was awarded $198.7 million in Alphabet stock in 2016. That is roughly double the stock Pichai received in 2015, when he was named chief executive of Google after the company reorganized as Alphabet. Don’t miss: 5 things to know about Google CEO Sundar Pichai Along with a $650,000 salary and $372,000 in recognized compensation in the form of personal security and flights, Pichai received total compensation of $199.7 million in 2016. That was nearly double his 2015 total compensation of $100.7 million. Pichai’s total compensation tops the CEO compensation packages tracked by Equilar for the past two years. In 2015, Dara Khosrowshahi of Expedia Inc. EXPE, -1.82% had the highest compensation among CEOs of publicly traded companies, at $94.6 million, according to Equilar’s annual study. Among proxy statements filed before April 1, Equilar found Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications Inc. CHTR, -1.04% was the highest-paid CEO for 2016, at more than $98 million. Pichai, though, would not show up on Equilar’s list because he is not the CEO of a publicly traded company, but rather of the Google subsidiary within Alphabet. Alphabet CEO Larry Page is the executive who would show up in Equilar’s annual study, and Page—along with fellow Google founder and Alphabet President Sergey Brin—accepted only $1 in annual salary and no stock compensation, according to the filing. Equilar spokesman Dan Marcec confirmed that Pichai was not included in the firm’s annual CEO-compensation study because of the quirks of Alphabet’s corporate structure. He said Pichai is “probably” the highest-paid top executive in the land. See also: The CEO of your company probably earns 276 times more than you do Equilar reported earlier this month that the early returns from its annual effort showed CEO pay on the rise, with median CEO compensation up 6% to $15 million and average compensation increasing from $15.5 million to $16.6 million. It is the largest increase tracked since 2013. Pichai received a $199 million equity award upon his promotion, Alphabet disclosed last year, and this year’s filing showed an additional $209 million biennial equity award issued in early 2016 that vests quarterly. The completion of the first award and beginning of the second appeared to lead to Pichai’s large total compensation for 2016. Other key Google execs fell between the Pichai and Page extremes: Diane Greene, who was hired to run Google’s cloud business late in 2015, received total compensation of $43.7 million in 2016, and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat received total compensation of slightly more than $39 million. Such large compensation awards are not unheard of among executives at large tech companies, especially when they receive big stock awards upon being hired or promoted. For instance, Tim Cook was handed a $378 million stock award when he was named CEO of Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.10% in 2011, making him the highest paid CEO that year. Last year, Cook’s total compensation took a hit, falling to $8.75 million from $10.28 million the year before, but he still has a massive cache of Apple shares. Since Google reorganized as Alphabet and made Pichai CEO of the Google division, Google stock has gained 39.1%, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.19% has risen about 14.8% over that period. The stock hit fresh record highs Friday after Alphabet beat earnings expectations, and Alphabet is the only company besides Apple with a market capitalization of more than $600 billion.

In addition, should general admission Season Ticket sales surpass 15,000 by July 31, 2016, and the club does not reach at least the Play-Offs, the Season Ticket refund, for qualifying Season Ticket holders only (see below), will increase to an incredible 50% of the Net Season Ticket Price.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google releases Google Assistant SDK developer preview By John Hoff - April 29, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google is pretty keen to spread the usage of the new Google Assistant, thereby replacing the older Google Now in the process. Google Assistant was initially integrated in Google Allo, Google Home, and in the Pixel phones – but now it’s also found in Android Wear and non-Pixel phones running Marshmallow and Nougat, with support for Android TV and Android Auto on the way. Today, Google is releasing the Google Assistant SDK developer preview, for developers to have fun with. The Google Assistant SDK allows developers to start building their own hardware prototypes that will have the Google Assistant embedded in the firmware. These platforms can include a self-built robots or even some voice-enabled smart mirrors. The foundational use is that the SDK will allow users to interact with the Google Assistant from any platform. Check out the intro video from the mothership below. For some inspiration, here’s Deeplocal – an outfit from Pittsburgh – making their own mocktails mixer using the Google Assistant SDK. You can even build one for yourself, as they published their documentation over Github. Check out their video below. You can get started with the Google Assistant SDK by signing up and downloading the SDK from the official page.

Owens Published: Apr 29, 2017 4:31 p.m. ET Share Head of Alphabet’s largest division made nearly $200 million in 2016, twice as much as any CEO tracked in the past two years Getty Images Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai received $199.7 million in total compensation in 2016, Alphabet reported Friday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Alphabet Inc. awarded Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai nearly $200 million in total compensation in 2016, more than twice as much as any CEO of a publicly traded company tracked in the last two years. In its annual proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed Friday, Alphabet GOOGL, +3.71% GOOG, +3.63% revealed that Pichai was awarded $198.7 million in Alphabet stock in 2016. That is roughly double the stock Pichai received in 2015, when he was named chief executive of Google after the company reorganized as Alphabet. Don’t miss: 5 things to know about Google CEO Sundar Pichai Along with a $650,000 salary and $372,000 in recognized compensation in the form of personal security and flights, Pichai received total compensation of $199.7 million in 2016. That was nearly double his 2015 total compensation of $100.7 million. Pichai’s total compensation tops the CEO compensation packages tracked by Equilar for the past two years. In 2015, Dara Khosrowshahi of Expedia Inc. EXPE, -1.82% had the highest compensation among CEOs of publicly traded companies, at $94.6 million, according to Equilar’s annual study. Among proxy statements filed before April 1, Equilar found Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications Inc. CHTR, -1.04% was the highest-paid CEO for 2016, at more than $98 million. Pichai, though, would not show up on Equilar’s list because he is not the CEO of a publicly traded company, but rather of the Google subsidiary within Alphabet. Alphabet CEO Larry Page is the executive who would show up in Equilar’s annual study, and Page—along with fellow Google founder and Alphabet President Sergey Brin—accepted only $1 in annual salary and no stock compensation, according to the filing. Equilar spokesman Dan Marcec confirmed that Pichai was not included in the firm’s annual CEO-compensation study because of the quirks of Alphabet’s corporate structure. He said Pichai is “probably” the highest-paid top executive in the land. See also: The CEO of your company probably earns 276 times more than you do Equilar reported earlier this month that the early returns from its annual effort showed CEO pay on the rise, with median CEO compensation up 6% to $15 million and average compensation increasing from $15.5 million to $16.6 million. It is the largest increase tracked since 2013. Pichai received a $199 million equity award upon his promotion, Alphabet disclosed last year, and this year’s filing showed an additional $209 million biennial equity award issued in early 2016 that vests quarterly. The completion of the first award and beginning of the second appeared to lead to Pichai’s large total compensation for 2016. Other key Google execs fell between the Pichai and Page extremes: Diane Greene, who was hired to run Google’s cloud business late in 2015, received total compensation of $43.7 million in 2016, and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat received total compensation of slightly more than $39 million. Such large compensation awards are not unheard of among executives at large tech companies, especially when they receive big stock awards upon being hired or promoted. For instance, Tim Cook was handed a $378 million stock award when he was named CEO of Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.10% in 2011, making him the highest paid CEO that year. Last year, Cook’s total compensation took a hit, falling to $8.75 million from $10.28 million the year before, but he still has a massive cache of Apple shares.

Owens Published: Apr 29, 2017 4:31 p.m. ET Share Head of Alphabet’s largest division made nearly $200 million in 2016, twice as much as any CEO tracked in the past two years Getty Images Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai received $199.7 million in total compensation in 2016, Alphabet reported Friday. By JeremyC. Owens Technology Editor Alphabet Inc. awarded Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai nearly $200 million in total compensation in 2016, more than twice as much as any CEO of a publicly traded company tracked in the last two years. In its annual proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed Friday, Alphabet GOOGL, +3.71% GOOG, +3.63% revealed that Pichai was awarded $198.7 million in Alphabet stock in 2016. That is roughly double the stock Pichai received in 2015, when he was named chief executive of Google after the company reorganized as Alphabet. Don’t miss: 5 things to know about Google CEO Sundar Pichai Along with a $650,000 salary and $372,000 in recognized compensation in the form of personal security and flights, Pichai received total compensation of $199.7 million in 2016. That was nearly double his 2015 total compensation of $100.7 million. Pichai’s total compensation tops the CEO compensation packages tracked by Equilar for the past two years. In 2015, Dara Khosrowshahi of Expedia Inc. EXPE, -1.82% had the highest compensation among CEOs of publicly traded companies, at $94.6 million, according to Equilar’s annual study. Among proxy statements filed before April 1, Equilar found Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications Inc. CHTR, -1.04% was the highest-paid CEO for 2016, at more than $98 million. Pichai, though, would not show up on Equilar’s list because he is not the CEO of a publicly traded company, but rather of the Google subsidiary within Alphabet. Alphabet CEO Larry Page is the executive who would show up in Equilar’s annual study, and Page—along with fellow Google founder and Alphabet President Sergey Brin—accepted only $1 in annual salary and no stock compensation, according to the filing. Equilar spokesman Dan Marcec confirmed that Pichai was not included in the firm’s annual CEO-compensation study because of the quirks of Alphabet’s corporate structure. He said Pichai is “probably” the highest-paid top executive in the land. See also: The CEO of your company probably earns 276 times more than you do Equilar reported earlier this month that the early returns from its annual effort showed CEO pay on the rise, with median CEO compensation up 6% to $15 million and average compensation increasing from $15.5 million to $16.6 million. It is the largest increase tracked since 2013. Pichai received a $199 million equity award upon his promotion, Alphabet disclosed last year, and this year’s filing showed an additional $209 million biennial equity award issued in early 2016 that vests quarterly. The completion of the first award and beginning of the second appeared to lead to Pichai’s large total compensation for 2016. Other key Google execs fell between the Pichai and Page extremes: Diane Greene, who was hired to run Google’s cloud business late in 2015, received total compensation of $43.7 million in 2016, and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat received total compensation of slightly more than $39 million. Such large compensation awards are not unheard of among executives at large tech companies, especially when they receive big stock awards upon being hired or promoted. For instance, Tim Cook was handed a $378 million stock award when he was named CEO of Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.10% in 2011, making him the highest paid CEO that year. Last year, Cook’s total compensation took a hit, falling to $8.75 million from $10.28 million the year before, but he still has a massive cache of Apple shares. Since Google reorganized as Alphabet and made Pichai CEO of the Google division, Google stock has gained 39.1%, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.19% has risen about 14.8% over that period. The stock hit fresh record highs Friday after Alphabet beat earnings expectations, and Alphabet is the only company besides Apple with a market capitalization of more than $600 billion.

Would we say we don't want FaceBook (and) Google to operate in India, we have homegrown apps," Sunil Mittal said. As the US under President Donald Trump turns more protectionist, telecom czar Sunil Bharti Mittal asked if India should say no to Facebook and Google just because it has similar homegrown apps. Not overly concerned about protectionism as his business is "rooted in the domestic market", Mittal highlighted that it is unfair that movement of Indian workers gets restricted, while foreign firms make huge profits in India. "If you come to a situation where skilled workers which actually drive your economy back home are going to be denied (entry) or Indian companies are forced to pay a particular salary just to become uncompetitive in those countries, I think that becomes an affirmative action against the companies that want to do trade there," he said. He was responding to a question on how he would react if Bharti Airtel was not allowed to operate in certain geographies. Citing examples of tech firms like Google, Facebook and WhatsApp that have millions of users in India, Mittal questioned if these companies should be allowed to operate in India even as similar homegrown apps are already there in the country. "You can't have (a situation) that on one hand and you have 200 million customers on Facebook, 150 million on WhatsApp, 100 million people on Google... Would we say we don't want FaceBook (and) Google to operate in India, we have homegrown apps," the Bharti Airtel Chairman said. Mittal said India is a big market for technology companies given the huge consumer base. Over the past few weeks, countries like the US, Singapore and Australia have taken steps to tighten their work visa norms. This could potentially impact the operating costs for Indian IT companies that send employees to work on client sites using visas.

Name: Subject: Message: Sundar Pichai makes it rain at Google, earns $200 million in 2016 Newsby Kris Carlon19 hours ago 11 1125 24 Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s 2016 salary was 325,000 times more than Sergey Brin and Larry Page’s salaries combined. Earning more than the co-founders of Google isn’t a hard thing to do though, with even the lowest paid Googlers far outstripping the salaries of Google’s CEO and President. As in previous years, Brin and Page took home a salary of $1 for their roles heading the parent company of the world’s largest search engine, while their protege Pichai raked in almost $200 million in total compensation for steering the good ship Google. See also: Google’s parent Alphabet had a 22 percent rise in revenue for Q1 2017 2 days ago Pichai’s annual salary remained stable at $650,000 (actually $2,500 lower than in 2015) but his stock award almost doubled from $99.8 million in 2015 to $198.7 million in his first full year at the helm of Google. That saw his total compensation rise from $100.6 million to $199.35 million – not bad for your second year on the job. But Pichai has surely earned the raise, charting a course for Google that saw significant increases in several areas. Google’s net income rose almost 20 percent in 2016 and sales saw a 22.5 percent increase under Pichai’s leadership. At the rate Pichai is going, he’ll be earning $1 in salary before he knows it.

Google App 7.1 beta is testing a search bar in the notification panel and may begin showing pollen counts [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:12am PDTApr 26, 2017 71 Plus 1 on G+ 117 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares265 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Search bar in the notification panel 1.2 Pollen counts 2 Download The Google app is responsible for a pretty staggering number of features ranging from the standard search interface, a voice assistant, and even a fully functional launcher. The latest update coming through the beta channel doesn't seem to have any new features going live quite yet, but there are a lot of changes to text and other resources, including the removal of all references to Bisto from the last teardown. Most of them are minor tweaks to features we've covered in the past, but a couple point to things we haven't explored yet. Users can look forward to pollen counts with their local weather and possibly a search bar located right in the notification shade. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Search bar in the notification panel It looks like Google is testing a new location for the quick search bar. A new setting in the apk describes placing a "search bar in the notification panel." The setting doesn't appear to be live yet, even on the Android O developer preview, which isn't surprising since it's marked as a beta. Before you assume this is going to be just another quick access tile like the toggles for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, let's be clear that the phrasing specifically says the search bar is in the notification panel and the word "tile" is never used. It could be worded incorrectly, which sometimes happens with unofficial features, but this sounds too specific to be a mistake. code <string name="search_notification_setting_title">Search bar (beta)</string> <string name="search_notification_setting_summary">Show quick search bar in the notification panel</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_google_search_button">Google Search</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_settings_button">Notification Settings</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_voice_search_button">Voice Search</string> res/xml/search_notification_preferences.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <SwitchPreference android:persistent="true" android:title="@string/search_notification_setting_title" android:key="persistent_search_notification_enabled" android:summary="@string/search_notification_setting_summary" android:defaultValue="false" /> </PreferenceScreen> Since the Android OS only allows very limited access to the UI of a notification, this probably won't be implemented as a regular notification. Contrary to the point I made above, it obviously still could be a simple quick tile that displays a search bar floating on top of whatever screen you're currently looking at. I'm going to venture another theory or two, although I admit this is crossing deeper into guesswork. This clue might suggest Google is planning to modify the notification panel itself to include a space for the search bar, possibly inserting it between the quick settings tiles and the actual notifications. I'm not sure many people would want a search bar in that spot, but it's not implausible. We can take that theory one step further, probably crossing into the realm of the unlikely, to raise the possibility Google could be planning to open up the notification panel to app developers even further and allow full-width widgets to be placed there. There are certain things that can't be done with either quick settings the tiles or regular notifications, so there is at least some justification for adding this capability, but it still feels unlikely. We might find out more about this as Android O gets closer to launch. Regardless of the specific implementation method, we can return to the original question of whether or not most users would want a search bar in the notification panel. Would it be redundant if there could already be a search bar on their launcher and long-pressing on the Home button can open up Assistant, or would this just give us another option if those don't fit our workflow? Since it's a beta, we may not get much more about this for a while. Pollen counts In my neck of the woods, as with the rest of the northern hemisphere, we're in the middle of Spring. That means we're enjoying warmer temperatures, sunnier skies, and longer days. For some, it's also time for unending fits of sneezing, itchy eyes, and all of the symptoms of hay fever. I don't personally suffer from this, but plenty of people do, and keeping tabs on the pollen count can be helpful for making plans to keep the allergies in check. Judging by a new image in the Google app, this information is about to get a little more visible. Titled ic_pollen_count.png, it's pretty clear what this flower image (that looks like it's sweating) will be used for. I expect it to show up with the standard weather predictions, much like it does on some other trackers and news outlets. It's a simple feature, but one that will surely be invaluable to millions of users around the world. Seeing as we're already in the middle of Spring, there's no better time for this information to go live, and probably could at any time. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Filipe Santos GOOGLE, I DON'T CARE, just give me Assistant on my 6P!!! Frisi I think you should have it. Most phones have it by now. Sam I still don't have it, either :( Yash Raj Chhabra Change language to english us. Give ur phone a restart and you should have assistant. Filipe Santos I'll not change to English, specially not Portuguese Brasil, I prefer to wait more 2 years or 10 :) Vratislav Jindra Be glad you don't have it, Assistant sucks (at least when compared to Google Now). It can't identify songs. It broke AutoVoice (a Tasker plugin) integration. You can't type to it, you always have to speak. Long pressing home button always comes up with the assistant screen, and there is no shortcut to go to the Google App itself. I just hate it, that's all. Cody Toombs The AutoVoice plugin can kinda already be solved with IFTTT for some actions, but doesn't really give the full range of capabilities. I think that's going to get better once some of the other features for Assistant are opened up. As for speaking your input, that's already in the works. It was mentioned in a previous teardown, and I'm a bit surprised it hasn't gone live yet. (link) Tim Lewis For quickly accessing Google Now (which I use to get a quick run-down on the news), I use Action Launcher and just have a shortcut set to open the Google app when I tap the home button when I'm already on the home screen. mattcoz Yes, I hate that you can't type. I don't want to talk to my phone, especially in public. Fernando Pena I have it already... 6p, developer preview, english language. demarcmj Forgot to finish that last sentence... "Seeing as we're already in the midst of the season that could benefit from" Imparus From what? The suspens is killing me :O Cody Toombs ^ The reason I shouldn't write these on so little sleep. :) Thanks, got it fixed. I was just saying this pollen count feature could launch at any time, and probably should soon. abqnm Thanks for the teardown! Also, your sleep-writing got you again. PP 6: There are certain things that can't be done with either quick settings the titles or regular notifications... Feel free to nuke this comment after reading it. Cheers! Cody Toombs Ahh, thanks. Good catch! Trooper311 Thanks for the write up Cody. I have noticed something of late with the Google app. I thought it was because I was on beta, but I got off of beta and it still does the same thing on my Pixel XL. Also on my wife's Moto X. For the weather cards, instead of saying the town that I am in, it states the township that I am in. This travels with me wherever I am. Home, work, a store etc. Any news on this by chance? Thanks. Cody Toombs I live in a place that barely exists, so I've always been bumped into neighboring areas. For that reason, I never really notice when things like that behave abnormally. Sorry. Trooper311 It's ok man. Appreciate you hitting me back. Cheers. CasperTFG #oceans11 Carson Saldanha Search bar in the notification panel seems pretty legit to me. DragoCubed Full-width widgets in the notification bar? Yes please. Search bar in the notification bar? Not so exciting Dennis Ulijn Can the search bar in the notification panel not be a reply line, like you get in messaging apps like hangouts, messages and whatsapp? Bombaglad i imagine that could be pretty easy to implement it that way for any 3rd party dev as a separate app (please correct me if i am wrong) Multiling O Keyboard Yes, I'm thinking to add app shortcuts to it with my Renegade Launcher app. ilovetesla whats the use of a pollen counter?? Cody Toombs "Pollen counts are measured from low, meaning they affect few individuals, to high, meaning symptoms affect most allergy sufferers." source ilovetesla but, a phone counting "pollen" WTF is this tech man Sup Are you being serious right now? Red No, he's being serious next Thursday. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Busy on Thursday, how about Friday? ilovetesla im not at an hospital man , im totally fine , thanks for ur concerns bro... Cody Toombs Is this is a serious misunderstanding or are you trolling? The actual data collection happens at a facility that monitors pollen counts, and the results are then sent out for people to see on their phones. Derek Ross Pixel 2 will come with pollen sensors. You heard it here first. ilovetesla ohhhh ... OK .i thought there will be some kind of sensor in future android devices that measures pollen things dammit !!!! i'm bad Cody Toombs lol, it's cool. We all do it from time to time :) Quint’s Sharking & Seashells I know, its bad enough that a phone can tell you how much rain we get. I don't want my phone getting wet. This is nonsense and i'm talking out of my ass. yardie Wow what an idiot ilovetesla Cody taught me that it happens at a data collection centres and sent back to phones for reference Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Sorry, a little off topic, but do any of you have an issue where the weather icons do not show up in the Google Now widget? Peacen1k Been an issue over several versions, so for quite some time now. Also, only 2 rows of tiles show up, the rest of the widget space is empty. Kawshik Ahmed Maybe it will be something like this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9abe1606e0efd2996cb434a33131a56a45a2a60b329ed1a4cec68331a778fafb.jpg 9+10=21 Nice jodieisme Thursday, July 28th..?🙈 Drakenoid Custom notification bar? Kawshik Ahmed No, it's the Notification Bar Search Widget of UC browser. Oasis Feng I guess the search bar in notification panel will be a normal notification with quick reply functionality as input field for quick search. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Time to start moving things to the bottom of the UI Google. #WebOs David Hyman I would be happy if it was implemented like how Textra handles the quick SMS notification. You hit the notification and the search widget appears as an overlay on top of everything else. They already have this overlay created too so it would be quick to implement in my opinion Ben Roberts I downloaded the apk but I don't see any search in the notifications Cody Toombs This is a teardown. Note the big disclaimer at the top and regular use of future tense as the feature is described. Captain_Invisible That means you have to read more than the title... Gonzales I see the search bar in the feed but not in the pull down notification, which is where I would like it. Rami I would like the search bar there, or back in overview. There's no way to easily open Google from Assistant without multiple taps, and my home screen setup has no room for a search bar.

The ATO has increased scrutiny over how much tax multinationals operating in Australia pay. In December, it said it was pursuing seven global businesses over A$2 billion ($1.50 billion) in unpaid tax. While the ATO has not named the businesses it is pursuing, Google’s Australia unit said in accounts filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that it will “lodge an objection” to the tax demand from the ATO. “The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims,” Google said in the financial statement released on Friday. The search giant did not disclose how much the ATO has demanded it pay in taxes. Google and the ATO declined to comment on how much the company’s amended tax bill was. Treasurer Scott Morrison said in April the country expected to claw back A$2.9 billion from companies under the legislation. Australia enacted the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law in December 2015 and the ATO has introduced new guidelines for foreign trading hubs. Google Australia restructured its operations effective January 1 of last year to comply with the legislation and its financial statement reveals an increase in revenue and tax for the 2016 calendar year as a result. Revenue surged to A$1.14 billion in 2016 from A$498 million in 2015, while total income tax rose to A$16 million from A$2.8 million in 2015, the accounts show. tags Google Alphabet tax Australia Australian Securities and Investments Commission more from business Amazon’s moves beyond retail get Wall Street thumbs up, for now Apr 29, 2017 16:04 IST India goes for e-ride, eyes all-electric car fleet by 2030 Apr 29, 2017 15:51 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

These are the surprising meanings behind ten popular company names… but how many do YOU know? The Google founders decided on the name after a student made a TYPO By Sophie Roberts 29th April 2017, 12:09 pm Updated: 29th April 2017, 1:26 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments DO you know the meaning behind the names of the world’s biggest brands? Some companies chose to title their products after their founders, while others take inspiration from unlikely sources. From Adidas to Häagen-Dazs, here are ten popular brand names explained… 1. Pepsi The creator of Pepsi claimed the fizzy drink aided digestion. Inventor Caleb Davis Bradham derived the name from the medical term “dyspepsia”, which means indigestion. 2. Google Tech giant Google actually owe their name to a TYPO. After a productive brainstorming session at Stanford University, founder Larry Page was fond of “Googolplex”. When a student spelled the word incorrectly, history was made and the owner decided to register the company in this name. Most Read in Living Does she own any clothes?!

Adidas 5 The athletics-apparel brand plays homage to its founder in its name There’s a common misconception that Adidas is short for “All Day I Dream About Soccer”. But the true meaning behind the athletics-apparel brand is actually a lot simpler. The word combines founder Adolf Dassler’s nickname, “Adi”, and the first three letters of his last name, “Das”. 4. Zara Zara was actually meant to be known as Zorba. Legend has it that the fashion retailer was forced to make a change after noticing there was a nightclub that shared the same name. Instead of getting rid of the letters he’d moulded for the shopfront, founder Amancio Ortega decided on Zara instead. 5. ASOS PA:Press Association 5 ASOS is the UK’s largest independent online retailer – but did you know what the letters stand for? ASOS is an abbreviation for “As Seen On Screen”. The online retail store had this name when it was founded in 1999, but it was later changed to the four-letter acronym. 6. Ikea Contrary to popular belief, Ikea isn’t actually a Swedish word. When putting together the company name, founder Ingvar Kamprad combined his initials with the first letters of a farm and village he grew up in. 7. Starbucks AP:Associated Press 5 Many also believe that the name was inspired by Starbuck, a character from Meville’s Moby Dick Starbucks‘ co-founder Gordon Bowker is the man behind the cafe chain’s name. He was inspired when he saw the word Starbo on an old mining map, which he then adapted. 8. GAP For years, there have been rumours that fashion retailer GAP is an acronym for “gay and proud”. Despite this, the name was actually inspired by the term “the generation gap”. 9. Häagen-Dazs handout 5 There isn’t much meaning behind the name of this sweet treat Reuben Mattus wanted to pay tribute to the Dutch when he came up with the brand name Häagen-Dazs. Instead of picking a name that was actually Danish, he came up with the fictitious word. When translated, Häagen-Dazs doesn’t actually mean anything at all. 10. Nike Nike founders took inspiration from Greek mythology when it came to naming the company. The brand shares its name with the goddess of victory.

In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against “two US-based internet companies” who were not named at the time. They had allegedly been tricked into wiring more than $100m to the alleged scammer’s bank accounts. On 27 April, Fortune reported that the two victims were Facebook and Google. The man accused of being behind the scam, Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, allegedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the companies from at least 2013 until 2015. “Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company,” the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in March. These emails purported to be from employees of the Asia-based firm, the DOJ alleged, and were sent from email accounts designed to look like they had come from the company, but in fact had not. The DOJ also accused Mr Rimasauskas of forging invoices, contracts and letters “that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies”. “We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities,” a spokeswoman for Google said in a statement. “We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved.” However, the firm did not reveal how much money it had transferred and recouped. Nor did Facebook – but a spokeswoman said: “Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.” Big firms targeted “Sometimes staff [at large firms] think that they are defended, that security isn’t part of their job,” said James Maude at cyber-security firm Avecto, commenting on the phishing threat facing big companies. “But people are part of the best security you can have – that’s why you have to train them.” He also told the BBC that Avecto’s clients have recounted phishing attempts that used senior staff’s hacked email accounts to convince employees that a request to wire out money was genuine. The sophistication of phishing scams has increased lately, according to a recent Europol report. “CEO fraud” – in which executives are impersonated by the scammer – was a particular worry. “The request is usually time-sensitive and often coincides with the close of business hours to make verification of the request difficult,” the report explained. “Such attacks often take advantage of publicly reported events such as mergers, where there may be some degree of internal flux and uncertainty.” In order to avoid succumbing to such fraud, firms are advised to carefully verify new payment requests before authorising them.

But the mass of Americans are barely getting by Hamish McRae @TheIndyBusiness Saturday 29 April 2017 09:45 BST Click to follow Wall Street investors are benefitting from the boom in the US tech industry Getty The first 100 days of the Trump presidency may have been lacklustre, and the first three months of the year certainly showed disappointing GDP growth – only 0.7 per cent annual rate. For high-tech America, this quarter has been a scorcher. So what matters more? This week saw the share price of Amazon, the Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft hit all-time highs. This was on the back of very strong results, with Amazon profits up 41 per cent and Google 29 per cent, and both Microsoft and Intel producing fundamentally strong, if less spectacular earnings. We will see what Facebook achieves when it publishes its results next Wednesday but the market expects another stunner, to judge by the surge in the share price in the past few days. Intel also traded within a whisker of its all-time high. This contrast between apparently slow growth and a booming high tech business is not new. It has been evident right through the recovery, and may in some measure be associated with the swing of voters towards their new president. The elite, either on the high-tech West Coast or among the Wall Street investors who have profited from them, are doing just fine. But the mass of Americans are barely getting by, for the figures suggest that this has been the slowest economic recovery since the Second World War. The business of America may indeed still be business, but it seems to be big business, not small.    Donald Trump's first 100 days: in cartoons 33 show all Donald Trump's first 100 days: in cartoons 1/33 Donald Trump's first 100 days in office were marred by a string of scandals, many of which caught the eye of the Independent's cartoonists 2/33 Trump's first 100 days have seen him aggressively ramp up tensions with his nuclear rivals in North Korea 3/33 Mr Trump has warned of a "major, major conflict" with the pariah nation lead by Kim Jong Un 4/33 Mr Trump dropped the "mother of all bombs" on alleged ISIS-linked militants in Afghanistan, amid an escalation of US military intervention around the globe 5/33 Mr Trump has been accused of falling short of the standards set by his predecessors in the Oval Office, including Franklin D Roosevelt 6/33 The tycoon's ascension to the White House came at a time when the balance of power is shifting away from Western nations like those in the G7 group 7/33 Western politicians, including the British Conservative party, have been accused of falling in line behind Mr Trump's proposals 8/33 Brexit is seen to have weakened Britain, reducing still further any political will to resist American leadership 9/33 Mr Trump's leadership has been marked by sudden and unexpected shifts in global policy 10/33 Trump's controversial missile strike on Syria, which killed several citizens, was seen by some analysts as an attempt to distract from his policy elsewhere 11/33 The President has also spent a large majority of his weekends golfing, rather than attending to matters of state 12/33 Though free of gaffes, a visit from Chinese president Xi Jinping spotlighted trade tensions between the two states 13/33 One major and unexpected setback came when Mr Trump's Healthcare Bill was struck down by members of his own party 14/33 Mr Trump has been a figure of fun in the media, with his approval at record lows 15/33 A string of revelations about Mr Trump's financial indiscretions did not mar his surge to the White House 16/33 Outgoing President Barack Obama was accused of wiretapping Trump Tower by his successor in America's highest office 17/33 The alleged involvement of Russian intelligence operatives in securing Mr Trump the presidency prompted harsh criticism 18/33 The explosive resignation of Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who lied about his links to the Russian ambassador, was just one scandal to hit the President 19/33 Many scandals, such as the accusation Barack Obama was implicated in phone-hacking, first broke on Mr Trump's Twitter feed 20/33 Donald Trump's election provoked mass protests in the UK, with millions signing a petition to ban him from the country 21/33 Donald Trump cited a non-existent terror attack in Sweden during a campaign rally 22/33 Donald Trump stands accused of stoking regional tensions in Eastern Asia 23/33 North Korea has launched a number of failed nuclear tests since Mr Trump took power 24/33 Theresa May formally rejected the petition calling for Mr Trump to be banned from the UK 25/33 When Mr Trump's initial so-called Muslim ban was struck down by a federal justice, the President mocked the 69-year-old as a "ridiculous", "so-called judge" 26/33 A week after his inauguration, Theresa May met with Mr Trump at the White House 27/33 Donald Trump's first days in office were marked by a hasty attempt to follow through on many of his campaign promises, including the so-called Muslim ban 28/33 Donald Trump's decision to ban citizens of many majority-Muslim countries from the US sparked mass protests 29/33 Revelations about Donald Trump's sexual improprieties were not enough to keep him from being elected President 30/33 British PM Theresa May was criticised by many in the press for cosying up to the new President 31/33 One of Mr Trump's top aides, Kelly Anne Conway, was mocked for describing mistruths as "alternative facts" 32/33 British PM Theresa May was quick to demonstrate that her political aims did not hugely differ from Mr Trump's 33/33 Donald Trump's inauguration, on 20 January 2017, sparked protests both at home and abroad There is no easy explanation, except to acknowledge that in part, at least, this evident dissonance between winners and losers is indeed valid. If you have a stock market boom, and the Dow Jones is up 21 per cent on last year, people who own stock will do very well. The more they own the better they will have done. That leads to another debate as to whether present share values, particularly of these high-tech companies that dominate the market, are justified. At some stage there will be a market “correction” – I love that euphemistic description of what the rest of us would call a share crash – but while these companies’ earnings continue to soar you can make a decent case to support these record market levels. But the “print shedloads of money and it has to go somewhere” argument, while probably correct, is only part of it. There are, I think, two other elements at work. The first is that we are mis-measuring GDP. This is a familiar theme, the argument being that the impact of Google, Facebook and the like have greatly increased people’s real living standards in a way that isn’t captured in the statistics partly because so many of the new services are for free, and partly because the benefits are often in saving people time and we find it difficult to put a cost on that. Trump's first 100 days in numbers The other is more general. We are in the early stages of a revolution, which has been dubbed the Fourth Industrial Revolution because its impact may be as big as the three preceding ones – that of steam and the railways, of electricity and mass-production, and of computers and telecommunications. In the early stages of any such revolution there are some obvious losers (think of blacksmiths) but many more, less obvious gainers (anyone travels in a car). So now we can see the losers, people who lose their jobs from automation, but are less aware of the gainers, who comprise nearly all of us. There is a further twist. In the early stages of any such revolution there are people who become vastly wealthy – the steel and oil barons in the US 100 and more years ago, the high-tech princes now – and the widening of differentials leads to social tension. Eventually societies adapt and that will happen again now. Meanwhile, set alongside such a gigantic economic force as US high-tech industry politics seem almost irrelevant. Barring some catastrophe that does not bear thinking about, our lives will be changed more by Facebook, Google and Apple, than by any incumbent of the White House.

(Photo by Mat Hayward/Getty Images for We Day) Cloud Computing, Google, Microsoft Cloud Giants Disagree on the Future of Corporate Data Centers by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on April 28, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet We heard two very different perspectives on the future of on-premise enterprise data centers from top executives on this week’s earnings calls by two of the world’s largest cloud providers. Microsoft, which has a huge – and growing – on-premise data center software business in addition to a quickly growing cloud one, is continuing to pursue a hybrid strategy, pushing the idea that companies will want to continue using their internal data centers while augmenting them with cloud services. Alphabet subsidiary Google, which never had the need for an on-premise software business, is playing up wholesale shift of enterprise workloads from corporate data centers to its cloud. Here’s Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai on the company’s earnings call Thursday: “Over the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of conversations that Diane (Greene, head of Google’s cloud business) and her team are having with customers. Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-prem data centers to the cloud. We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business.” Microsoft’s server product revenue grew 7 percent in the first calendar quarter (or third quarter of Microsoft’s fiscal 2017), indicating that its hybrid play is about more than protecting a legacy business. See also: Can Google Lure more Enterprises Inside Its Data Centers? The Cloud’s Edge The concept of on-premise infrastructure for Microsoft has evolved beyond just core enterprise data centers. It’s that, plus edge nodes for processing data generated by the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, retail stores and other sources of data. The company is building its next generation of on-premise data center software to bring artificial intelligence (in the form of neural networks) to customers’ edge nodes, so they can analyze and make decisions on the spot, while being part of a distributed infrastructure, which also includes the cloud and core enterprise data centers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Thursday’s earnings call: “Right when everyone’s talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. Whether it’s IoT, whether it’s the auto industry, whether it’s what’s happening in retail, essentially compute is going where the data gets generated, and increasingly data is getting generated at the volumes in which it’s drawing compute to it, which is the edge.” The strategy rests on two key on-prem products: Azure Stack and SQL Server. Azure Stack is the hardware and software appliance designed to act as a private extension of the public Azure cloud in corporate data centers and as edge nodes of this hybrid network. Following several instances of postponing its release, Microsoft’s latest expected general availability launch date is sometime around mid-2017. SQL Server 2017, expected this fall, is designed to run across customers’ own data centers, both core and edge, and their public cloud resources. It will support both Windows and Linux, as well as R, Python, and other programming languages widely used for machine learning and big data analytics. Here’s Nadella again: “The innovative work we’re doing is what I would characterize as the future of true distributed computing, which is it will remain distributed. And that’s what we are building towards.” Google and Microsoft remain far behind Amazon in terms of cloud revenue. However, virtually all major contenders for enterprise cloud market share, including Google, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and Alibaba, reported faster cloud revenue growth than Amazon’s. More on that here: Despite Growing Faster Than AWS, Top Cloud Contenders Still Far Behind What’s Amazon’s Take? Amazon Web Services acknowledged the importance of on-premise data center infrastructure in a big way last year by striking a partnership with Dell Technologies-controlled VMware, whose server virtualization software is ubiquitous in corporate data centers. VMware’s software will be sold as cloud services on top of AWS, at which point the companies promise seamless integration between those services and customers’ on-premise VMware environments.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) CDNs, Cloud Computing, Featured, Google Google’s Edge Data Center in Cuba Comes Online by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on April 28, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Google this week started bringing online servers in Cuba that cache its content to improve performance for Cubans and reduce connectivity costs for the internet giant. It is the first internet company from overseas to extend its network’s edge to Cuba. Here are all the essentials on this news: Says Who? Dyn Research, the research arm of the Oracle-owned DNS giant Dyn that tracks the internet’s health worldwide on a daily basis, noted the launch on Wednesday. Google confirmed that the servers had gone online this week in an email to The Verge. The Why Cubans can now access Google’s content, such as YouTube videos, faster because it is stored locally and doesn’t have to travel over a submarine cable from Venezuela. Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at Dyn, told BuzzFeed: “I think this will be very noticeable for Cubans. The internet in Cuba will still be a painfully slow process. This is just another somewhat rare step forward. For Google services, which will be hosted in country, it will be a milestone.” It’s also usually cheaper for a content provider to store popular content locally, since it doesn’t have to pay for long-distance data transport. In other words, it’s cheaper for Google to store Gangnam Style in Cuba than paying to transport the video from somewhere on mainland South America every time somebody wants to see the most popular YouTube video of all time. More on how this works here: How Edge Data Centers are Changing the Internet’s Geography The How Google got to connect its servers to Cuba’s networks by making a deal with ETECSA, the island’s state-run ISP monopoly. It touted the deal in December, following a signing between Google chairman Eric Schmidt and ETECSA president executive Mayra Arevich, as reported by The Guardian. It’s unlikely that Google actually built a data center in Cuba to do this. The company leases colocation space for its edge nodes, and its Cuba node is likely to be hosted in an ETECSA facility. Google has more than 100 caching sites around the world, connected to the same global network as its 15 to 20 central data center hubs. The content cached on Google servers in Cuba likely originates at the company’s core data center in Quilicura, Chile, and makes several hops before it reaches the landing station in Venezuela. More on Google’s data centers here: Google Data Center FAQ As of Wednesday, Dyn’s Madory could not get a remote server in Cuba to connect to Google’s network via Google’s servers on the island, which means the new caching site is a work in progress: “I can see the server is there and I can interact with it, but Cubans are not yet getting automatically connected to it.” More Connectivity and Faster Internet for Cubans? Far from it. Those on the island lucky enough to have regular internet access will see Google’s services perform faster, but the move will make zero to little difference for the majority of the population. Home internet connections are illegal for most, but ETECSA has an ongoing pilot program meant to eventually connect 2,000 homes. Once the pilot is complete, the telco will switch to a paid service, which is expected to cost $15 to access the internet for 30 hours at 128 kbps, according to The Associated Press. Considering that an average Cuban makes $25 per month, it’s hard to expect a flood of new internet users to log on. Most people in the country connect to the internet via public WiFi hotspots, paying $1.50 per hour.

Pichai received a salary of USD 650,000 last year, slightly less than the USD 652,500 he earned in 2015. But the long-time Google employee, who was named CEO during the company's re-organisation in August 2015, received a stock award of USD 198.7 million in 2016, roughly double his 2015 stock award of USD 99.8 million.

Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing, the report said.

The search giant said Tuesday that it will make it much easier for anyone to give it feedback on its search results, which is the way that most people use Google. For everyday users, that means that if you see a result featured on Google's pages that you think is wrong or offensive, then you can actually do something about it. Share this story File image Google framed the problem as a quality issue. "Today, in a world where tens of thousands of pages are coming online every minute of every day, there are new ways that people try to game the system," said vice president of engineering Ben Gomes in an official blog post. According to Google, approximately 25 percent of its results "have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content." The company didn't specify how many queries that really is - but the search-engine-focused news site Search Engine Land reported that Google estimated in 2015 that it handles 3 billion searches per day. Some back-of-the-envelope math suggests that users could be seeing as many as 7.5 million misleading results every day. Users will see options to report bad information that shows up in "Featured Snippets", aka, the little summary boxes that appear at the top or sides of Google searches. They will also be able to report offensive auto complete suggestions - the suggested phrases that show up when you begin typing a query in the search engine. Users can report suggestions for being hateful, explicit or violent. For the snippets, users can also report when the summaries are inaccurate. Google has also tweaked its search algorithms to ensure that "low-quality" content shows up lower in search results, which should minimize their reach. This should address issues such as one Google dealt with last year, when a prominent Holocaust denial site showed up at the top of search results for "did the holocaust happen." Since the US election, several companies including Google and Facebook have taken steps to deal with false information that looks legitimate being passed through their products. Read also: Google, Facebook in 'fake news' furore In the past, both companies have been hesitant to step in and provide quality controls for information that appears on their products, preferring instead to let their algorithms weed out bad results. And like Facebook, Google has recently undertaken broader efforts to fight misleading information and hate speech online. The company has started pairing some claims online with fact-check articles, which say whether a claim is true or false. It has also released a tool for developers to let them automatically moderate online messages better. Google users will start seeing the reporting options Tuesday. This particular effort has been underway since mid-December, said Google spokeswoman Susan Cadrecha in an email.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio National Science Sports World Variety Education Real Estate Cities4Climate Google gets Australian tax office demand to pay more Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Sydney, April 29:   Alphabet Inc's Google said it will challenge amended tax assessments issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which is trying to claw back billions of dollars from multinational corporations citing unpaid taxes. The ATO has increased scrutiny over how much tax multinationals operating in Australia pay. In December, it said it was pursuing seven global businesses over A$2 billion ($1.50 billion) in unpaid tax. While the ATO has not named the businesses it is pursuing, Google's Australia unit said in accounts filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that it will lodge an objection to the tax demand from the ATO. The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims, Google had said in the financial statement released on Friday. The search giant did not disclose how much the ATO has demanded it pay in taxes. Google and the ATO declined to comment on how much the company's amended tax Bill was. Treasurer Scott Morrison had said in April the country expected to claw back A$2.9 billion from companies under the legislation. Australia had enacted the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law in December 2015 and the ATO has introduced new guidelines for foreign trading hubs. Google Australia had restructured its operations effective January 1 of last year to comply with the legislation and its financial statement reveals an increase in revenue and tax for the 2016 calendar year as a result. Revenues surged to A$1.14 billion in 2016 from A$498 million in 2015, while total income tax rose to A$16 million from A$2.8 million in 2015, the accounts show.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Alphabet Rides Advertising Strength to New Highs Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) released strong first-quarter 2017 results on Thursday after the market closed, highlighted by continued strength in mobile and YouTube, as well as sustained momentum for its other bets segment. Let’s take a closer look, then, at what drove Alphabet’s business to start this year, and what investors should expect from the company going forward. IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET INC. The big picture Quarterly revenue grew 22.2% year over year (24% at constant currency), to $24.75 billion, and translated to 23% growth in operating income, to $6.568 billion. On the bottom line, GAAP net income increased 29%, to $5.426 billion, and net income per diluted share climbed 28.4%, to $7.73. Google doesn’t provide specific financial guidance, but both the top and bottom lines were well ahead of consensus estimates for revenue of $24.19 billion and earnings of $7.40 per share. „Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017,” added Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat. „We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet.” Alphabet breaks its results in to two primary segments: Google and „other bets.” Here’s how they performed as compared to the same year-ago period: Metric 3 Months Ended March 31, 2016 3 Months Ended March 31, 2017 Year-Over-Year Growth Google segment revenues $20.092 billion $25.802 billion 28.4% Google operating income $6.245 billion $7.598 billion 21.7% Other bets revenues $165 million $244 million 47.9% Other bets operating income (loss) ($774 million) ($855 million) N/A DATA SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. On Google Let’s start with Google, which is obviously Alphabet’s bread-and-butter segment and includes Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, Google Play, Gmail, and YouTube, as well as Commerce, Apps, Cloud, and hardware. Advertising comprised the bulk of Google’s revenue, as usual, rising 18.8% year over year, to $21.411 billion. Within that, ad revenue from Google sites rose 21.5%, to $17.403 billion, with the largest contributor being healthy growth from mobile search. Advertising from Google network members’ properties grew 8.6%, to $4.008 billion. Meanwhile, Aggregate paid clicks grew 44% year over year, including 53% growth in paid clicks on Google sites and a 10% increase in those on network members’ properties. Aggregate cost per click — which essentially measures how much Google makes per ad — declined 19% year over year, including 21% and 17% declines on Google properties and network member properties, respectively. For that, investors can partly thank the continued outperformance of YouTube, where TrueView ads tend to reach consumers earlier in the purchase funnel and thus monetize at lower rates than traditional web ads. That said, Alphabet also noted it changed its methodology for paid clicks and cost per click this quarter „to include additional categories of TrueView engagement ads and exclude non-engagement based trial ad formats.” As a result, the above metrics reflect „a modest increase in paid clicks and a modest decrease in cost-per-click.” Google also kindly offered perspective with updated figures for several previous quarters using the new methodology. For example, last quarter , aggregate paid clicks climbed 36% as reported, and cost per click fell 15%. But using the new method, Q4 2016 aggregate paid clicks would have reflected higher 39% growth, and the decline in cost per click would have been closer to 17%. Finally, other (non-advertising) revenue within Google increased a strong 49.4% year over year, to $3.095 billion, driven by Play, hardware, and cloud solutions. On other bets Next, Google’s other bets segment remained unprofitable, as expected , while continuing to drive solid 47.9% year-over-year growth in revenue (to $244 million) from its conglomeration of compelling early-stage businesses. Similar to the past several quarters since Alphabet shifted to this segment-based reporting approach , other bets revenue was primarily generated by Nest (connected home products), Verily (life sciences), and Fiber (high-speed internet). But its operating loss also includes the costs of other mostly pre-revenue businesses like Calico (focused on human longevity), Google Capital (capital investments), and Google X („moonshot” projects). „In Other Bets, we’re determining the size and pace of investment appropriate to each bet given their stage of development and achievements against milestones,” Porat elaborated during this quarter’s conference call. „We expect to increase near-term investment in certain areas while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment in others as they move along a path to commercialization.” Alphabet regularly reminds investors that because these businesses operate in a number of disparate industries, and in various stages of growth, their results don’t enjoy the same level of relative predictability as the mature advertising segment. Looking forward During the call, Porat also discussed the virtuous cycle created by its core ad business, stating: The strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from Cloud, hardware, and YouTube subscription offerings. Cloud is one of our most important strategic priorities given the scale of opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector, and the fact that the requirements for success align with many of our strengths. We will continue to invest here for the long-term opportunity. Similarly, hardware remains an exciting growth opportunity for us, and you’ve seen the early indicators again this quarter. All things considered, it’s apparent that Alphabet is firing on all cylinders, with multiple irons in the fire enabled by its thriving advertising operations. With shares of Alphabet sitting near an all-time high today, I think current investors should be more than pleased with where their company stands. 10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares) When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Name: Subject: Message: Google I/O 2017 schedule gets filled out to help you plan ahead of time Newsby John Callaham21 hours ago 1 215 6 In less than three weeks, thousands of software and hardware developers will be coming to Mountain View, California, and its Shoreline Amphitheater, to attend Google I/O 2017. The company’s annual developer conference, from May 17-19, is one of the biggest highlights of the year for Android fans, and now Google has posted some more details of the event’s schedule so that attendees can plan which ones they want to check out ahead of time. See also: Google Play Awards 2017 nominees are in 6 days ago Google points out that while it has posted more information on the sessions it will run during I/O 2017, not all of them have been revealed yet. That’s because the company is keeping a few of them secret until after the opening keynote for the conference, which will happen on May 17 starting at 10 a.m. Pacific time (1 p.m. Eastern time). In addition, some sessions will allow for attendees to reserve their seat ahead of time, to help cut down on lines. However, there will be a few seats that will be open for each session in case some folks want to attend at the last minute. The size of each tent has also been increased, to accommodate more people. In response to feedback from last year’s Google I/O, this year’s conference will also have double the number of Office Hours. This should help app developers get more time to chat with Google team members. Also, the sandbox demo areas will be inside climate-controlled structures this year, which should help keep people cool and dry for those events. We expect there will be a bunch of major announcements, and maybe one or two surprises, made at Google I/O 2017. Stay tuned as we will be attending the conference to get all of the big news first-hand.

Now, the two victim companies have been identified as Facebook and Google. Both the companies have confirmed to Fortune that they had allegedly been targeted by 48-year-old Evaldas Rimasauskas. He allegedly had bank accounts in Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Hong Kong. Last month, the US Department of Justice framed charges against Rimasauskas for wire fraud, money laundering and identify theft for which he is expected to face 20 years prison time. He allegedly masqueraded as an Asian-based electronics manufacturer which both Facebook and Google regularly did business with. Further, he is said to have forged email addresses, invoices, and corporate stamps of the Asian-based company to send phishing mails to employees of the victim companies. Previously, the US Department of Justice had released a press statement after charges against Rimasauskas were framed. However, it did not give out names of the victim companies, and described them as “a multinational technology company and a multinational online social media company”. Fortune put out statements from both Google and Facebook spokesperson, that said: “Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation,” Facebook spokesperson told Fortune.  “We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved,” a Google spokesperson told Fortune. Google and Facebook, are among the largest Internet companies in the word, and have some of the most sophisticated security systems. The case brings to surface the fact that no company, big or small, is fully protected against phishing attacks by cyber criminal.

Austria Seeks to Tax It Anyway by Boris Groendahl @borisg_work More stories by Boris Groendahl April 29, 2017, 12:00 AM EDT Social Democrats eye levy on ads, taxes on digital ‘barter’ Austria says 1 billion euros lost to corporate tax loopholes Photographer: Yichuan Cao/NurPhoto via Getty Images Austria is seeking ways to make digital services like Alphabet Inc.’s Google or Facebook Inc. pay taxes for transactions with the nation’s internet users, trying to plug gaps in a tax system still designed for brick-and-mortar business. The most ambitious part of the plan targets the business models of Twitter Inc., Google or Facebook: The tacit pact under which searching, liking, posting and tweeting remains free as long as users let the companies feed usage data into algorithms that help tailor advertising that can be aimed at the most likely buyers. That arrangement is a form of bartering, and a value-added tax could be imposed on such transactions just as the levies are extended in other parts of the economy, said Andreas Schieder, the parliamentary head of Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern’s Social Democrats, which govern in a coalition with the conservative People’s Party. “The business transaction that’s going on here is that users are paying with their personal data,” Schieder told journalists in Vienna. “The business model of those internet companies is based on massive revenues that are generated with the help of those data.” Amending Code Raising more taxes from digital businesses is part of a broader plan to amend the country’s corporate tax code. The package also includes closing loopholes that allow “aggressive tax planning” and corporate tax avoidance, which cost the Alpine country as much as 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) a year, about a fifth of its annual corporate tax revenue, Schieder said. The Social Democrats’ plan has two other elements targeted at internet companies: It would extend the Austrian tax on advertising revenue to digital formats, and it would tax purely digital services that are acquired by Austrian customers from companies with no physical presence in the country. Schieder said the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has made proposals for calculating and implementing such taxes, especially in its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. “We need a new approach to make sure that taxes are paid where revenue and profit is made,” Schieder said. “The OECD has made practical suggestions how to define digital establishments for tax purposes.” The proposals will need the agreement of conservative Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling. The goal to raise tax revenue from digital companies and to tax international companies “more efficiently” is part of the government’s policy update agreed in January.

Alphabet's Google will challenge amended tax assessments issued by the Australian Taxation Office, which is trying to claw back billions of dollars from multinational corporations citing unpaid taxes. The ATO has increased scrutiny over how much tax multinationals operating in Australia pay. In December, it said it was pursuing seven global businesses over $2 billion in unpaid tax. While the ATO has not named the businesses it is pursuing, Google's Australia unit said in accounts filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that it will “lodge an objection” to the tax demand from the ATO.  “The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims,” Google said in the financial statement released on Friday. The search giant did not disclose how much the ATO has demanded it pay in taxes. Google and the ATO declined to comment on how much the company's amended tax bill was. Treasurer Scott Morrison said in April the country expected to claw back $2.9 billion from companies under the legislation. Australia enacted the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law in December 2015 and the ATO has introduced new guidelines for foreign trading hubs. Google Australia restructured its operations effective January 1 of last year to comply with the legislation and its financial statement reveals an increase in revenue and tax for the 2016 calendar year as a result. Revenue surged to $1.14 billion in 2016 from $498 million in 2015, while total income tax rose to $16 million from $2.8 million in 2015, the accounts show.

Sunday Chronicle Hyderabad Chronicle Chennai Chronicle Bengaluru Chronicle Kerala Chronicle Science Editors' Picks Technology, In Other News YouTube ad boycott could spell trouble for Alphabet's Google AP Published Apr 29, 2017, 11:53 am IST Updated Apr 29, 2017, 11:54 am IST YouTube's inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in into a problem child.  Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. YouTube's inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child. It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service — one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. The company's earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday's extended trading. CLOUD OVER YOUTUBE But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. "There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person," says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. "They don't want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don't have to because they have many other choices." Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had "thousands and thousands" of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. "We are evolving overall to a better place," Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing "extraordinary" growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won't leave a huge dent in Alphabet's earnings. That's because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company's golden goose — Google's dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet's revenue even as it expands into other fields. But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. TAKING THE GLOSS OFF Before the boycott began, YouTube's ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. "This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand," says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. FLIGHT OF THE BRANDS At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. TEMPORARY HIT OR PERMANENT SCAR? Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. "It's going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away," he said. "There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term." Investors, however, apparently aren't too worried so far. YouTube's financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google's ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet's net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

AOSP site gets updated with Material Design, a better mobile view, and clearer navigation Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/17 5:31pm PDTApr 17, 2017 32 Plus 1 on G+ 83 Share on Facebook 68 Share on Twitter Total Shares183 Android OS Design Development News Google has given its Android Open Source Project (AOSP) website a considerable makeover, making it much easier on the eye and much more user-friendly too. The update brings it in line with Google's own Material Design guidelines, improves the mobile view, and introduces new top-level tabs to improve navigation. Previous design: Out with the old This is the place to go for those who want to customize and port their own build of Android. As well as offering the Android source code itself, the website also contains vast amounts of instructional information. The overhaul has included a reorganization of content to allow for easier browsing and searching. Surprisingly, given the subject matter, the mobile browsing experience wasn't the friendliest before. Now, with a dedicated mobile view and responsive design, the site looks great on whichever device you choose to view it. Even on a desktop, it is much better looking, filling the full width of the screen and using larger, more legible type. The site's previous design had a decidedly Android 4.4 KitKat feel to it, so it's good to see it finally brought up to speed. The security section has also been pushed to the fore in the new navigation — according to Google, this mirrors its ever-increasing focus on keeping the Android platform safe going forward.

Averix Why would you waste time updating it then? LOL With the whole ecosystem, unless they make the apps cross compatible or a very clean cross compile and delivery system, it isn't changing anytime soon. Fadakar So it's not outdated for the next 4 years? Do you know understand how that works? Averix I guess they just have time, money, and workers to burn then. I guess I don't "know understand how that works". Raphael Duran On unrelated news I found this new "My Apps" layout on the Play Store today. Is this new or am I just late to the party? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad9a33273fded7d05dbd45242804003f10cc71ea5bb7c9efeb1285263d51d96d.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/154310687d8bcd8e4fdf627a4859bd248841631887a8a9355e2ea14d395c377a.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9c4d0eabac6f0831f101ba38e9a1194fc5bb0180948f74925eb81f79226a8293.png Carson Saldanha Same, I just got mine this evening. It's still yet to grow on me. Raphael Duran It's different but I kind of like it Carson Saldanha Would've been more consistent if they used pull to refresh, but of course, Google. lol Also, I wish they would add the "What's new" for apps in the "Updates" tab itself, so that way I don't have to always open the app page each time I want to see what's changed. Raphael Duran Yes, I wondered how didn't they use the pull down to refresh too but then I remembered it's a Google app and it all made sense Amir Arsyad What version are you on? I installed 7.7 and got this one too Raphael Duran I'm on 7.6.08 WitnessG Just cleared the data on my play store and I got this design too.

It wasn't here earlier today for me. I've been waiting since I read that story. This should have been in existence since the beginning. 4Ui812 I remember reading that.

Among other newly added features, the app can now automatically pull in train and bus tickets sent to your Gmail address. Before this update, Trips could collate all your flight, hotel, and car reservations. These will appear also in the reservations section of the app, in between your various hotel stays, allowing you to better see how you’re moving between one place to the next – even if not by air. Also, a new update allows you to enter in the reservations by hand, especially in cases where there is no email confirmation. To do this, you will need to press the “+” sign in Trips to sign in before adding a restaurant, hotel, car rental, and flight manually. The fact that those details are being manually typed in doesn’t stop Google from helping you to auto-complete the information required. Credit: https://blog.google/topics/travel/five-ways-google-trips-can-help-you-enjoy-your-next-vacation/ Google has also added a space for free-form notes that enables you to add other types of reservations that you want to track, but don’t fit into one of the high-level travel categories, TechCrunch reports. This should be the perfect place in case you want to add details of your trip. Want to share your reservations with other parties? Of course, you can as Trips now offer you with similar feature you can find in other major apps designed for tourists and travelers. Simply tap an arrow button on the reservations screen to forward the details of your trip via email to anyone. Your plans can be seen by anyone using the apps. Google Trips app is a late entrant in the travel and tour market, but these newly added features will make it more competitive and make it more appealing to many people. The fact that Google already boast of some other travel and search apps that can boost your traveling plans, gives Trip a soft landing. Credit: https://blog.google/topics/travel/five-ways-google-trips-can-help-you-enjoy-your-next-vacation/ Besides being a free app, and available to every iOS and Android users for free, the app uses content from your Google account; making it easier to plan your trips. Based on the travel information, like car reservations, hotel receipts, and flight confirmation, among others, in your Gmail inbox, Trips can create trips automatically. The app also gives you real-time updates on flight delays and gate changes so you will never miss a thing. What’s more is that you can download all those details so you can access it while you are traveling and no Internet. However, you will need to be online to get those real-time updates. Compared to other travel apps, Google Trips offers other incredible features for every trip. When you open it, you will see a list of your upcoming, past and current trips. Tap on a journey and you’ll find additional options and information that’s beyond your standard reservations.

Now, in order to further expand its ecosystem, the company has announced the developer preview of Google Assistant SDK. Google says that by utilizing the capabilities of the SDK, developers will be able to construct their own hardware, such as a voice-enabled mirror, and integrate it with Assistant. The SDK also features the gRPC API, which is responsible for handling authentication to access the API, documentation, and samples. The SDK allows developers to receive audio responses for a spoken query by harnessing the Google Assistant service. Although the company says that this SDK is ideal for testing with Raspberry Pi devices, it adds support for other platforms as well. That said, Google has emphasized that this is a developer preview, and that the company has many new features in the pipeline, including integration with a companion app. You can download the SDK by visiting Google's dedicated site here and ask questions about it on Stack Overflow here.

So how is a technology giant supposed to protect itself from malicious attackers attempting to take advantage of unseen vulnerabilities? Why, by attempting to hack it themselves of course.  That’s where Parisa Tabriz comes in, Google’s head of product security for the company’s Chrome browser. Ever since her entry into Google in 2007, the 34-year-old security expert and her team have detected countless bugs and loopholes in Chrome’s security system, patching them before they can be exploited by outside hackers. She was even featured on Forbes’ 2012 ‘Top 30 People Under 30 To Watch In the Technology Industry’ list. It’s no wonder then that she’s earned herself the moniker of “Security Princess” among both cyber security professionals and the media. Calling themselves the ‘Department of Chromeland Security’ Tabriz and her team of 30 white hat hackers (security researchers who attempt to hack systems for good, as opposed to black hat hackers that breach software for personal gain or sport) are hard at work everyday to make Chrome the most safe browsing experience it can possibly be.  The 'Department of Chromeland Security' in 2016, minus the 'Browser Boss' herself - Images courtesy Parisa Tabriz/Flickr “For a significant chunk of my waking hours, I work here [Google] making things like this [Chrome] more secure,” Tabriz says on her website. “I've also had the privilege of working with the US Digital Service to enhance network and software security at the White House. Hacking information security is fun, and I'm pretty lucky I get paid to work on it with the world's best. Recently, I've been focusing on making the web safer to browse so users don't get pwnd, making Internet traffic more secure, spreading the hacker mindset, and trying to improve diversity in the tech industry because it leads to more innovation and better results.” Indeed, Tabriz and her team of hired hackers have to think like black hats, in order to preempt attacks on people using Chrome. “I have worked at Google for 10 years and my job has changed over those 10 years but our mission has stayed the same: to keep our users and their data safe,” she said in an interview with Digital News Asia. And the Chrome security team really have their work cut out for them; they’re responsible for protecting billions of people from being scammed, robbed, or having their identities stolen, most of whom may not even recognize when they’re the victim of a hacking attempt or be able to differentiate between an encrypted website and a fake one. Part of they way they do this is by publicly outing websites deemed insecure, pasting a red “Not secure” warning in the URL of a website using HTTP instead of an encrypted HTTPS connection.

Women are till date grossly underrepresented in technology and computer science, yet she occupies a management position supervising a 30-strong team of mostly male coders, across Google’s US and Europe headquarters. However, Tabriz has better hopes for the future. “Fifty years ago there were similar percentages of women in medicine and law, now thankfully that's shifted.” And to do her bit to help more young girls get into coding, she regularly mentors under-16 students at that teach children white hat hacking. She also especially encourages girls to pursue internet security work, and the field of computer science in general. “Hacking can be ugly,” she told the Telegraph in an interview. “The guy who published the private photos of those celebrities online made headlines everywhere. What he did was not only a violation of these women but it was criminal, and as a hacker I was very saddened by it. I feel like we, the hackers, need better PR to show we're not all like that. After all I'm in the business of protecting people.” 12.8K SHARES PROMOTED STORIES Addicted to Strategy Games?

Alphabet/Google exceeds Q1 expectations and continues to grow Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 8:04pm PDTApr 27, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 39 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares110 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/28 7:40am PDT As markets open today GOOG's stock is up almost 4.3%. Alphabet, every AP reader's favorite umbrella corporation for their favorite company, has posted the results of their first 2017 quarter's earnings. Things are looking pretty good, too. Revenue and income are both up from the same period last year, even though Alphabet's tax rates have increased. Just as a preliminary aside, for the purposes of this article I'll be using the names Alphabet and Google interchangeably. This isn't accurate, since Alphabet is involved in a lot of business outside of Google, but it's a reasonable convenience to think of them interchangeably. EPS (or earnings per share), for any of our readers invested in ye olden GOOG, are set at $7.73, a fairly high number in itself. That is up almost two bucks since this time last year. The majority of the bump in earnings seems to be coming from an increase in advertising revenues, and in net earnings (read, the bottom line) Google's up over a billion since this time last year. Further inside Google's earnings reports they actually show that at a base level paid clicks haven't increased as much as they did in previous quarters, so most of the increase in advertising is likely a result of the decreases they are reporting in associated costs and an increase in volume. Even revenue from Google's so-called "Other Bets" moonshot category is up, which is a good thing for anyone interested in the continuation of Google's more eccentric projects. I would have figured most of the moonshots would be subsidized by Google's other businesses. It's pretty cool to see that, at least as a whole, they're pretty self-sufficient. Alphabet's headcount is also up pretty significantly. They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. Honestly, I'm a bit stunned at how much growth they've seen, here. News of Alphabet's coming earnings release drove our dear GOOG stock up a bit today, and after things balanced out we've settled at around a 0.3% increase, which is mostly in line with the increase other tech companies have seen today. Stock isn't always a perfect indicator of a company's success, though. For example, Microsoft's reports of missing revenue expectations this last quarter has resulted in almost double the percentage increase Google saw, even though Microsoft saw a drop immediately following their announcement. Alternate title: Google's umbrella can't keep things dry when it's raining money. Update 1: 2017/04/28 7:40am PDT As markets open today GOOG's stock is up almost 4.3%.

Especially as competitors like FB are taking up more of the ad pie. 😆😄 I know you read 9to5G also... today there was an article that quotes the head of Google Cloud Platform saying they will surpass Amazon in 2022. Will that do it for you? Roger Siegenthaler and you believe them? ddevito No they won't. Enterprises don't trust Google abc Surpass Amazon in what? Amazon's cloud powers many of the internet's most popular sites. If the head of Google Cloud genuinely believes that he will beat them by 2022, then he's a moron. You obviously are a fanboy, which you makes you a moron by definition. Suicide_Note Which is why they have other projects and endeavors aside from search. Do you really think that the people who run and advise Google haven't thought about this? destinyhud cloud and hardware is the next big thing for google. cloud(yearly) and hardware(quaterly) is already a billion dollar business for google. they need time to become huge Lateef Alabi-Oki Google be like... https://media.giphy.com/media/l41lFvtuqmey9QTAY/giphy.gif Dirty Dave man i miss wearing jeans that were way to big Lateef Alabi-Oki I still won't rock skinny jeans. blahmoomoo The stock price is actually up around 4% after hours.

I'll update the post with the new numbers now that markets are open (and I am awake.) charlie Jason Interesting. Hopefully this will allow them to hire some competent designers to slim down the iBezels and competent supply managers keep their phones in stock. Max Johnson They could relocate some of the employees who currently are making new messaging apps. But in seriousness looks like they're working on that already. charlie Jason Really? Maybe bezel-less is too hard, but I definitely hope for reasonably slim bezels or at least front facing speakers for Pixel 2. Suicide_Note Maybe Alphabet can also spare a few bucks to hire someone competent to make your comments witty, insightful, original, and/or funny? charlie Jason Butthurt Pixel fanboy much? Aaron The iBezel part was lame, bro. But to your defense, whomever is responsible for the Pixels must have skipped the section on supply and demand in high school economics. Suicide_Note Don't know why you would make that assumption, considering i said nothing about the Pixel, not did i express any offense about his comment. Perhaps you should prob Alphabet for a loan too, as it seems you could use some help with your reading comprehension. Fitzgerald42 Now that was clever ddevito Funny you should say that. David Foster, who ran the entire Pixel Division, just left to go back to Amazon. JD Thank goodness George yeah, those designers went to the Allo Sticker team~ charlie Jason LOL shots fired! diese does this mean we will get more messenger and sticker packs?? TheManuz I stopped when I read "our favorite UMBRELLA CORPORATION" Now i know where all their AI experimentation is aimed to! Ryne Hager Don't be a hard dog to keep under the porch, Manuz. TheManuz Damn, I had forgotten that line! ArunRock You got me at Umbrella Corporation dhamp2g To celebrate our earnings we are going to add a new money themed sticker pack. ...and add the pixel to the End of Life list.... Defenestratus Time to start looking at breaking up Google, Apple and Facebook. abc No way. It's America. I say Google, Apple and Facebook should merge into one monopolistic behemoth. Then we can hear the most capitalist country on earth whine about the lack of competition. ddevito Is there any mention of how much revenue mobile advertising produced? Because that's the number that counts. Until Google/Alphabet/whateverthehelltheycallthemselves figures out a reliable way to grow revenue on mobile this is all smoke and mirrors, which is what the whole Alphabet fiasco was about TheScientists I thought I had read a story a few months back that mobile ad revenue had already surpassed desktop. Yep, here you go: https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Moves-Majority-Share-of-Googles-Worldwide-Ad-Revenues/1014633 Ryne Hager Yeah, I would have loved to see advertising actually divided up in the quarter's revenue reports. Some other marketing firms have put together their own estimates showing that mobile is accounting for most of it now. But, without details about revenue from mobile sites vs apps, etc., those third party estimates still don't tell much. I wish Google would be transparent about that. Aaron Really does look like since they're doing this good they could have chosen a better ODM for the Pixels. Either HTC sucks at manufacturing or Google has another issue entirely. No excuse for the Pixel to still be out of stock. Daan Smit Google doesn't care about you having a Pixel or not. You're not the customer; you're their (personal)-data-generating-life-stock. They want to collect your data from any Android device you can use. Pixes is just one of them and therefore not a focus point. Google's customers are enterprises buying target-advert content based on your personal data gathered. That's where their focus is and hence the profit. destinyhud well google care about pixel now that they are making profit for them as well. Klark Kenneth Those pesky taxes! Come on Trump, hurry up and get rid of corporate taxes so the rest of us can share the burden, Google needs a new pair of shoes!! jcopernicus "They've hired almost 10,000 more people since this time last year, so the increases haven't seem to come as a result of cutting things back. " The intimation that cutting back is an action to increase revenue is so hilarious. Cut backs are made to stop losses, not to stimulate growth. Defenestratus Indeed, and there is only so much cutting back you can do. Ryne Hager I was just surprised. With the projects that did get cut this year I assumed at some level there had to be losses going on, but they still exceeded estimates. Even the moonshots (at least, as a whole), which includes Fiber, were able to keep things profitable with the layoffs and cuts there. I had an expectation at some level that those cut-backs were a negative indicator, and that ended up being entirely incorrect.

The Google Assistant SDK is now publicly available, allows developers to port Assistant to new devices Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:26am PDTApr 27, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares142 Development Google News Videos One of the reasons Amazon's Alexa assistant has become so popular is because it can be integrated into nearly everything. We've seen phones, speakers, and even refrigerators with Alexa. Now Google is opening up Google Assistant to the same level of accessibility, with the new Google Assistant SDK. With the SDK, developers can integrate Assistant into existing products fairly easily. It remains to be seen how much functionality will be available to third-party devices running Assistant, as it is already fragmented on Google's own devices. But the focus seems to be primarily on voice, not visual displays like Assistant on Android. To make developing easier, the SDK includes the gRPC API, a Python client that handles user authentication and access to the API. This is especially useful if you are trying out the SDK on a Raspberry Pi or similar development board. This first version of the SDK is a Developer Preview, with several features still in development - including hotword support and companion app integration. Google has created a G+ community, a Stack Overflow tag, and a mailing list to help out developers using the SDK. I'm definitely going to try it out myself.

Randroid Looks like I need another Raspberry Pi... Corbin Davenport I haven't actually dug into the SDK yet, but if you don't care about connecting other hardware to Assistant (using the Pi's data pins, for example), I don't see why the Python library wouldn't work on any computer with Python installed. Randroid I'm willing to spend some time tinkering with things. I might put it on the same Pi as my Plex server... maybe I can play things directly from my Plex server using just my voice :-) Eric Abreu It looks like it's actually compatible with several other platforms and languages: https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-other-platforms/ CD RW I need a Pi to build my own Google Home surethom Let's hope developers are better than Google, google cannot even get google home to add calendar entry's or even the basic like play my uploaded music by artist or song title . pfmiller Google Assistant is Google Assistant.

Eric Siedlecki Does this mean manufacturers will now be able to add Assistant to their devices, therefore creating actual Google Home rivals? That'll be awesome.

JG Wouldn't mind seeing a Windows based Google Assistant. Replace Cortana. Too bad, though, it appears your stuck using the "OK Google" trigger phrase. Being able to replace it with "OK Computer" would be great in this instance. Avi Faitelewicz See above: "hotword support". JG Hotword support, for the standard "ok Google" trigger. Not custom triggers. Watch the embedded video. He specifically mentioned OK Google or use of a hardware button. No mention of custom trigger phrases.

How to customize Chrome's terrible New Tab page Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:02am PDTApr 27, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares139 Applications News Article Contents 1 Removing suggested content 2 Removing recent downloads and offline pages 3 Removing recently-visited bookmarks 4 Show tabs from other devices 5 Turning on the condensed layout 6 Switching to the Chrome Home interface Back in Chrome 54, Google replaced Chrome for Android's New Tab page with a new design that prominently featured suggested content - much like Google Now's feed. To quote Douglas Adams, "This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move." Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. If you're not a fan of Chrome's cluttered New Tab page, there are a few workarounds you can try to make it a bit more usable. You can even mix and match features to create a more personalized design. The below workarounds require enabling or disabling Chrome flags. To do this, navigate to "chrome://flags" (without the quotes), press the menu icon, select 'Find in page,' and type the name of the flag starting with the hashtag symbol. Removing suggested content Removing the suggested articles list is pretty simple. Find the #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Once you do that and re-open Chrome, the list will no longer appear on the New Tab page. Removing recent downloads and offline pages The New Tab page also shows recent file downloads by default, but this is fairly easy to remove as well. Find the #enable-ntp-asset-download-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Then make sure you re-launch Chrome, and it should be gone. In addition, pages you have saved for offline reading show up on the New Tab page. If you want, you can turn this off by disabling #enable-ntp-offline-page-download-suggestions. Removing recently-visited bookmarks By default, Chrome shows bookmarks you have recently visited on the New Tab page. This can also be turned off by disabling the #enable-ntp-bookmark-suggestions flag. Show tabs from other devices As you may know, Chrome syncs your open tabs across your devices, so you can easily pick up from where you left off. There is a hidden flag that adds a 'Tabs from other devices' section to the New Tab Page. The only catch is that suggested articles has to also be turned on, which is a bit of a bummer. To turn it on, make sure both #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions and #enable-ntp-foreign-sessions-suggestions are set to Enabled. Then, reopen Chrome, and your tabs from other devices should appear. Turning on the condensed layout If you do like the suggested content or other features on the page, you still might want to turn on the condensed New Tab page layout. This removes the large space at the top, where the Google logo normally sits, allowing for more content to be visible without scrolling.   Left: Condensed design disabled, Right: Condensed design enabled To turn on the condensed layout, simply enable the #ntp-condensed-layout flag and re-launch Chrome. This is already enabled by default in Chrome Dev, at least on my device, so it may come to Chrome stable in the near future. Switching to the Chrome Home interface Chrome is constantly changing, and there's already another revamp of the New Tab page interface in development. It's called Chrome Home, and it moves the address bar to the bottom of the screen. With this new layout, the New Tab page is accessible by swiping up from the address bar, and it includes navigation icons for Downloads, Bookmarks, and History.    This new design only works on Chrome Dev and Canary for now. To try it out, switch #enable-chrome-home and #ntp-google-g-in-omnibox to Enabled and re-open Chrome. There you have it - a few tips to make Chrome's New Tab page less awful.

George at this rate, They need an 'Of The Hour' section... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Switching what the Bixby button does was possible with an app, but the recent update removes this ability. Nerds go apoplectic with rage against Samsung. Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. No outrage yet. Corbin Davenport Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ An EXTRA button, i.e., a button other phones don't even have. Does Samsung have a good reason for locking it into Bixby? It's too early to tell. Shaun39 You should put a sarcasm tag at the end of your clueless comments. EcE An EXTRA button many people reportedly have been pressing accidentally more often than trying to use it. MadMartigan Bingo. They could at least have put it on the other side. As it is, 100% of the time I hit I am trying to turn the volume down. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You'll never admit it, but I guarantee you'd be complaining no matter where they put the button. MadMartigan I think you may be having some trouble reading for comprehension. I'll gladly admit it, as it has been my point all along. Not a fan of Bixby. Not a fan of the button placement. Wouldn't mind at least being able to remap it to make it at least marginally useful rather than just simply in the way. They put the button in a very bad place. Adding insult to injury - they have now disallowed making it at all useful to anyone not inexplicably fond of Bixby. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does. Also, if they put it on the right, I guarantee people would still complain about accidentally pressing it. In other words, you guys will complain about anything as long as it's Samsung. EcE The point you are missing, is the comment you are replying to: "Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change." Having that button which you could be able to disable if Samsung weren't dicks, is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people don't even have yet. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! The nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. EcE Because when someone found a way to change it's behavior, Samsung quickly blocked it. An extra hardware button is more annoying than a home page you can just ignore, period. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And you can use another browser. Nobody's forcing you to use Chrome. You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it. Or just buy a phone without an extra button. That'll show Samsung. Same difference. MadMartigan "You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it." Proof positive you just straight up refuse to understand that the placement is a problem for some people. "Just not pressing it" is not as simple as you seem to want to make it sound. I've accidentally launched it several times trying to lower the volume on the 8+ and I can only imagine it would be even worse on the S8. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Proof positive you're just a whiny baby. I've accidentally pressed the volume button many times when trying to press the power button, because my hand grabs both sides of the phone to get the leverage to press the power button. As much as it may amaze you to hear this, I survive this heart-rending inconvenience. MadMartigan God forbid anyone express an opinion that doesn't cast Samsung in the best possible light... /s MadMartigan ..and you nerd rage against anyone who thinks it might not be the best thing ever, can we talk about that, maybe? You know, since we're apparently not allowed to discuss the possibility that they might have handled it better? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You implied that the lack of complaints was because Chrome 58 is still rolling out. I pointed out that the nerd rage about the button occurred before people got their phones, thus nullifying your point. Discuss anything you want. MadMartigan Except any possibility that Samsung could have done something better. Apparently we're not allowed to do that without being called names... MadMartigan "If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does." So a bad key placement could not be made at least marginally better by allowing to map to something you might actually someday use... Got it. Your logic is flawless... /s Necdet Ali Özdür How come people don't press other buttons accidentally but​ somehow keep pressing Bixby button all the time? EcE Who said that? Necdet Ali Özdür ... you? EcE Oh yeah? I said: "Bixby is the only button people press accidentally" ... I'm sure I did. and btw, HTC's power button just below the volume buttons is/was (HTC 9/10 and whichever else they did the same) something to complain about as well. Either way, the point here is that having an extra button that cannot be disabled/remapped is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people have not seen yet. Necdet Ali Özdür That doesn't mean those people won't see it, I guess that's the point you are missing. Both decisions can be reversed by respective parties by means of a software update, but people (especially here in Android Police) complain about Samsung the most. EcE Nah, I think we enjoy bi+ching about everything Necdet Ali Özdür Who doesn't? 😂 MadMartigan Possibly due to it's bad placement. Have you been paying attention? Necdet Ali Özdür It's placed where a button could be placed on an all screen phone. Like the rest of them it's on the side. MadMartigan So there's no other place they could have put it? Really? I hope you're actually trying to be dense... Do phones you use not have tops, bottoms, or right sides? Do they have no room at all below where the button is currently placed on the left? Necdet Ali Özdür I hope that next phone you own will have a power button on the bottom and volume buttons on the top. Because those are valid positions to place buttons. Yeah. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It doesn't matter where the buttons are. If it's a Samsung phone, at least 75% of AP commenters will be outraged. MadMartigan ...and the one fanboy will attempt to shout down anyone with a valid opinion regarding how it could have been better. Because to him, Sammy can do no wrong. FWIW: I have not owned a Samsung since the S2 and as this was the first one without the ridiculous home button, I jumped at it. I like pretty much *everything* about the device other than the absurd Bixby-button. MadMartigan lmao. Are you being serious? HTC had power buttons on the top - never once accidentally powered it off. You really cannot accept that the placement may not be optimal for some people? That this is the only place they could have put it? Necdet Ali Özdür It's in a place where majority of current devices have their buttons. Sounds more optimal to me than the places you've suggested. Some people may not like to have it at that place, or not have that extra button at all. But in my opinion it is the best place to place Samsung could've put it. MadMartigan So the right side, where there is currently only one button, would be a worse place for it? They couldn't texture the power button and have the bixby button 1/2 inch below it? That wouldn't be better than the same texture as the volume keys, and right next to them? I mean heck, even if they'd just added a texture to it...that would have been better. Necdet Ali Özdür It is significantly smaller than the volume button (which is a rocker now) which makes it easy to differentiate with a finger. But yeah a texture wouldn't hurt. I agree you on this one. But if it was on the right side, I'm pretty sure people would still complain as much as they do now, claiming they're confusing it with the power button and such. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're complaining because it's a Samsung phone. If this was a button on the Pixel, it could be in the worst possible location and they'd go to the ends of the earth to defend it. MadMartigan Honestly, I would have loved it on the right, in a perfect location to be hit by the finger right above the pinky when needed. Power-index, Bixby two fingers down. Would have, IMO, been perfect. Could have even gone without the texture on that one. Where it is now, you're going after it with your thumb. Until muscle-memory kicks in, it's a crap-shoot where it's going to land initially and unless you expect to have to double-check, you're going in to press - and could easily press the wrong one. It's all personal preference, to be sure, but I do believe they could have appeased far more people by putting it on the right. FWIW - the same complain was leveled at HTC when they placed the power/volume buttons on the same side, though I do not believe the volume was a rocker on that model. Could have been done better. My favorite device was actually the One M7 - which had the power-button on the top. Power-top, volume-right, nothing on the left. Zero possibility of confusion. (Power on the back would have been fine as well - V20 nailed the fingerprint sensor/power on that one.) bekifft There is no good reason for locking hardware functionality away from the user. Don't give them a pass on taking more control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ As I say below, the nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. This isn't about timing. It's about Google love vs. Samsung hate. MadMartigan Wow. Someone's triggered... Tiuri Elvander I was and am still outraged. Have been since this came up in the review of 58 Beta Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, so far, that makes one of you, vs. the dozens of people who went into a nerd rage about the Bixby button, many of whom don't even have or want the phone. MJ I don't use Chrome a lot to care enough to disable the new tab page crap but why would Google stop users from customizing it? I can do that with Firefox... Address bar at the bottom of the screen? WTF? Michel Sa Address bar at the bottom makes a lot more sense on a mobile phone. Renan In a mobile phone, having the address bar at the bottom of the screen makes a lot of sense MJ No... ipsofact yes... MJ How have I been able to use the address bar on my phone at the top all this time? EcE Magic? ipsofact we never said you could not use the address bar on your phone. But on mobile its a lot quicker and pain free to have it at the bottom. Unless you want to stretch your thumb all the time. MJ Come on... Are you a human? When I hold my phone my thumb is already naturally pointing toward the top of my phone so would need to stretch it to make it to the bottom. Regardless, I happen to have nine other fingers and the on-screen keyboard pops up in the same place anyway. I have been using the address bar at the top of browsers for over 20 years now so don't need to be changing my workflow habits now and just on my phone on top of it. ipsofact typical ive been doing this for 20 years so I wont change the way I work. You know I work with several people with the same mentality.. I have been using the address bar at the top since day 1 but today I changed it to the bottom. Works great and believe me I won't let the old "ive been doing it like this for years" ever stop me. Or just put the phone upside down. it works ;) MJ Change is not the issue... It's change for no good reason or benefit. At least give the user control to change it back. Some unknown God(s) at Google one day just deciding the address bar will now go at the bottom is ridiculous. Microsoft tried that crap on a larger scale with Windows 8. How did that work out for them? ipsofact You can change it back and forth. Its up to the user to decide. So we are not being obligated to do anything. Just given options! :) Which I like. I can decide the whether the bar will go up the top or the bottom. MJ What? LOL The whole article is about Google not allowing users to disable the crap on new tabs. Thanks for your input and have a good day. MadMartigan "It's change for no good reason or benefit." Thankfully, your refusal to see the reason or benefit does not affect the ability of anyone else to. MadMartigan He said it made sense on the bottom - not that it wasn't unusable on the top. Reading is fundamental. FeelThePoveR It depends on the usage. Sometimes I press my hardware buttons accidentally when doing the swipe up gesture on the bottom adress bar in chrome (closing the tab/app or whatever). I'm still loving it though. MadMartigan People still use mobile Firefox?? ipsofact Firefox still use mobile people? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Except for Android and the Play Store (and their dependencies), I'm off all Google apps. I'm sick of the constant BS coming out of Google. I use Dolphin as my browser. If I get frustrated with Android enough, I'll just give up my precious S Pen and give an iPhone a chance. MadMartigan I loved that change and wish they'd bring it to desktop Chrome. Would love a "Google Now" start-page on the desktop. Kieron Quinn I've used iChrome as a Google Now-esque NTP for a while, it used to be a lot better (especially when it actually got Google Now cards via a hidden API) but is slowly getting worse: http://i.imgur.com/vfO7Kfq.png Lindajgomez My last paycheck was $22500 for working 12 hours a week online.Start earning $97/hour by working online from your home for few hours each day with GOOGLE...

Jarrett Lennon Kaufman #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions isn't available in mine, so I can't turn on Recent Tabs like I'd like to... akshay7394 It wasn't there for me either, but after enabling the foreign tabs thing and relaunching chrome, it just showed me recent tabs anyway. Not sure why. cgrant There are apps that will do this without all the fuss. Try TabMark. deepdvd That's a Chrome extension, not a mobile app. Try again? pfmiller I think the easiest solution is just to stick with Chrome 57 until Google fixes this mess.

Joe press ctrl shift b Peter On mobile, you numnutz.. SpasilliumNexus It's numbnuts, dumbass. bekifft Thank you for this article. This is just further encouraging my use of Brave. Not a big fan of the name, though. AGT Am I the only person on earth that wants a simple setting for "Use blank for new tab and focus url bar dammit!"? The unnecessary time for all that crap to load before the url bar will respond just kills me, and then you still have an extra tap to bring your keyboard up. Setting all those flags is a small improvement only. abc Another method is to uninstall Chrome, and install Firefox. Greatly improved my new tab page.

File Photo Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing Houston, Apr 29:   Google’s 44-year-old India-born CEO Sundar Pichai received nearly USD 200 million in compensation last year, double the amount he got in 2015. Pichai received a salary of USD 650,000 last year, slightly less than the USD 652,500 he earned in 2015. But the long-time Google employee, who was named CEO during the company’s re-organisation in August 2015, received a stock award of USD 198.7 million in 2016, roughly double his 2015 stock award of USD 99.8 million. The company’s compensation committee attributed the lavish pay to Pichai’s promotion to CEO and “numerous successful product launches”, the CNN reported. Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella. Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing, the report said. In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice controlled smart speaker. These efforts have started to pay off for the company. Google’s “other revenues”, a category that includes hardware and cloud services, hit nearly USD 3.1 billion in the most recent quarter, a gain of about 50 per cent from the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet’s stock has soared this year, pushing it above a USD 600 billion market cap this week for the first time, the report said.

Google was just your first one, and you failed. So, stand up, be proactive and act professional! There’s no time to lose. 10 best Google Adsense Alternatives Here are some of the best Google Adsense Alternatives you can try to monetize your website without using Google Adsense, and I’ll tell you how they work and why you should consider them, so let’s start: 10. Revenue Hits I recently discovered Revenue Hits and it looks like a great contender. I signed up and was quickly contacted by a manager to see how their ad platform for publishers work and they have a ton of features to make money. Revenue hits is a Performance Ad network, which means they pay you for results (CPA which is great for many niches), however, they have CPM and CPC models too. Revenue hits has an interesting platform that learns from your Ads so if you give them a try make sure to keep their ads running for 2-4 days to get the best results. Another great thing is that they have different monetization channels available. You can create banner ads, sliders, pop -unders, buttons and more. Revenue Hits pays on a NET 30 basis and they issue payments via wire, Paypal and Payoneer! Create your account and get started in just a few minutes HERE! Note: I just moved Revenue Hits to the first place because some publishers have been generating more than $100 per month in their first try with Revenue Hits. Some of them are already generating a lot more, and there’s no entry barrier such as with Adversal (500k monthly traffic). I’d recommend to get started ASAP with Revenue Hits and let us know how it does for you! 9. Amazon Associates Google Adsense Alternatives Amazon You can make a good amount of money from Amazon, especially in Christmas and other holidays Amazon is the biggest online store in the world, so they must be doing something good. Well, if you have a website that talks about any product that can be found on Amazon, then Amazon associates could work for you. Amazon allows you to put dynamic image ads to your blog, so that you can promote them and while this isn’t a Pay-per-click or CPM program, it will pay you a small commission for everything they sell from your links. So let’s say you have a blog about Apple products and you put an ad driving them to buy an iPod or just a cable. If they buy it, an small commission will be for you. So if you sell a $10 cable you might receive a few cents, but sell a $1500 Laptop and you might receive $100. The good thing is that everything they buy through your link (even if it isn’t the product you recommended at first) will generate a commission for your. the only con I find with Amazon, is that they need to send you a check that could take weeks to arrive to your home, unless you live in the United Stated of America where you can provide your Bank account. You can use this with Adsense at the same time. Sign Up Here 8. Yllix Media Yllix is a network I have heard a lot in the last years that has a decent CPM and many monetization options. Their homepage might look simple but their dashboard is great and it’s easy to get started. Yllix has Pop under ads, mobile redirects, sliders, layer ads and full page ads so you can get a good CTR and make money with them. Definitely a good option for starters and their approval is fast. Sign up here. 7. Chitika The reason I put Chitika on the number 3 of this list, is because Chitika is very similar to Adsense. they allow you to customize your ads, and it only serves contextual ads. One good thing is that you can use it along with Adsense and there are no problems at all. Chitika pays via Paypal ($10 USD minimum, which is good for starters) or via check ($50 minimum). If I were to recommend an ads service as an alternative to Adsense, Chitika would be my first choice, hands down. Chitika can pay you via paypal if you need. Sign up Here and get your account approved fast and easily! 6. Tribal Fusion Tribal Fusion is no small network. They work on a CPM basis and you need a lot of traffic to get accepted (500,000 unique visitors per month). This is a great alternative for those working with viral websites (read my case study) or sites that already have a lot of traffic. There are some other similar networks but I think Tribal Fusion is one of the best. Sign Up Here 5. Infolinks Infolinks is a Pay per click advertisement network that allows you to make money through your blog based on specific keywords. Infolinks indexes your pages and automatically add some hiperlinks in your text. Of course, since this isn’t a CPM program, it might take you a while to start earning a regular passive income through it, but it’s still an alternative to Adsense. They can pay you via Paypal, Wire Transfer, Check Western Union, ACH and Payoneer and there’s an initial limit of $50. Infolinks is great for big websites and it works in English, Spanish, French and German websites. Start using Infolinks Here. 4. PopAds PopAds is a performance network specialized in Pop Unders. They have good rates and they can monetize all countries. Something great about PopAds is that they can pay daily as long as you earn $5 or more per day. Their quality is good, and they also have pop ups and other monetization methods. Their approvals are easy and setting your ads takes just a few minutes. Sign up as a publisher Here. 3. Adversal Adversal is a great alternative of Adsense and works as great as Chitika. They have good banners and the CTR and revenue adapts to get the best results for your website. I’ve seen the Ads on Adversal have a good CTR and they have good image ads too. This is probably the Ad network which seems to work better for those looking for a replacement of Google Adsense. It works decently with other languages too (Chitika doesn’t). You account gets approved really fast and they also have Pop under /CPM ads as an option. Note: Adversal requires a website with a minimum of 50,000 page views per month, but they have proven to work really well. I earn over $500-1000 per month. They also pay via paypal. Sign up Here 2. Revenue Hits I recently discovered Revenue Hits and it looks like a great contender. I signed up and was quickly contacted by a manager to see how their ad platform for publishers work and they have a ton of features to make money. Revenue hits is a Performance Ad network, which means they pay you for results (CPA which is great for many niches), however, they have CPM and CPC models too.

Revenue Hits pays on a NET 30 basis and they issue payments via wire, Paypal and Payoneer! Create your account and get started in just a few minutes HERE 1. Propeller Ads Media Propeller Ads is one of the biggest pop-under networks available. They started working on 2011 and quickly developed into one of the biggest networks with great CPMs. They specialize in monetizing websites for the following niches: entertainment, videos/movies, games, dating, finances, software, gambling and more. If you’ve got one of this sites, you could make more money with Propeller than with Adsense. They also have banners but the pop unders work better overall. Also, if you’ve got mobile traffic, they’re a great Adsense alternative as they work closely with ad networks that monetize apps and mobile services leading to huge ROIs and great CPMs too. Propeller pays on a NET 30 basis and they have a great fill rate for tier 2-3 countries. So if you’re struggling to monetize traffic from countries like India, Singapore, Turkey, South Africa, etc. Propeller has a big inventory for them too.

Previously, Home only linked up to the account of whoever set it up first. Now, the device will be able to handle multiple accounts and tell who's speaking to it, offering personalized answers to some questions. Share this story File image That's a feature that Amazon's Echo doesn't have. And it's important for a voice assistant that's designed to run your household. For an assistant such as Siri, which lives on devices used by just one person, multi-account support isn't as important. But home hubs sit in a central location and operate things such as your lights or your thermostat that everyone will want to be able to control. Being able to identify an individual's voice may also help cut down on some unwanted surprises. Google said in a statement that the new feature makes it so that "only you would be able to shop via Google Home. “So others - i.e, your kids or an intelligent parrot - shouldn't be able to tell Home to buy something on your account. That avoids instances like one in San Diego this January when Amazon Echo units started ordering dollhouses after hearing a news anchor said "Alexa ordered me a dollhouse." Google Home, right, sits on display near a Pixel phone following a product event, in San Francisco. Google’s voice-activated assistant can now recognize who’s talking to it on the Google’s Home speaker. AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File The anchor was reporting on a story about - what else? - A child buying something without permission on the Echo. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) That said, the company also noted the voice feature isn't yet foolproof. "We're just getting started and we won't be perfect," the statement said. "We don't recommend that users rely upon voice identification as a security feature." While there are benefits to having home hubs distinguish different voices, there are also some privacy implications to think about. Consumers worried about their voice data being collected in general should think twice before picking up a home hub, said Bradley Shear, of the privacy-focused, Maryland-based Shear Law. With this new feature, he said, it's worth keeping in mind that Google will have even more specific information about you, which could be used in ways that consumers may not realize - particularly if it's combined with other information tied to your Google account. Consumers should also think about how this information could be used outside of the company, Shear said. He pointed to a recent murder case in Arkansas where police asked Amazon for audio recorded from the suspect's home hub, the Echo. (Amazon originally fought the order before the suspect agreed to share the information.) Shear said that case illustrated how recordings made in your home may end up being used in unexpected ways. "It has a clean voiceprint from you," Shear said, speaking of the new feature. "Once something is digitized, you don't know where it could end up." After all, while both Google Home and Alexa devices only collect voice data when you use their respective wake phrases - "Alexa," "Ok Google" or "Hey Google" - anyone who owns one of these devices also knows that they can sometimes trigger by accident. That opens up the potential for comments you make in private to be taken out of context or shared to an audience you never intended, particularly if the recording can be definitively identified as your voice. (Users can wipe their voice recordings from their Google accounts, per the company's privacy policy.) From a usability standpoint, there are also some problems with these hubs that identifying individuals by voice can't fix. This won't solve the "Burger King" problem of commercials being able to trigger the Google Home through your television. Anyone in range of the Google Home will still be able to use its non-personalized features. Read also: Google says Allo to new smart home tech So even if you don't create an account for your guests or your children, they'll still be able to ask it to do things such as answer questions, set timers, or play videos on a Chromecast. To set up the new feature, users will have to hop in to the Google Home app, which should have a new option for "multi-user" support on any connected Google Home connected to your network. Home owners can add up to six accounts, according to a company blog post. Google Home owners will have to teach the hub how to identify their voices by saying "Ok Google" and "Hey Google" twice into the device, when prompted. This allows it to learn different characteristics of each person's voice. This kind of training should be familiar to anyone who uses Siri, or the voice assistant on Google's phones - the key difference being that you'll have to go through it multiple times on Home, depending on how many accounts you want to hook up. Google said that it will use its network to "compare the sound of your voice to its previous analysis so we can understand if it's you speaking or not." The company promises this should only take a few milliseconds. The feature is rolling out to all US users starting Thursday. Google said it also plans to bring this feature to the United Kingdom in "the coming months."

Shares53 Sat, 29 Apr 2017-11:22am , ANI Google CEO Sundar Pichai's compensation doubled in 2016 to $200 million. Google CEO Sundar Pichai doubled the amount he made in 2015, as he received nearly $199.7 million in compensation last year. According to a filing from Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), the company's compensation committee attributed the generous pay to Pichai's promotion to CEO and "numerous successful product launches." Alphabet's stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time. Pichai's base pay was a mere $650,000. On top of that, he received a stock award for $198.7 million, reports CNN. Under Pichai's leadership and keen eye, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware, and cloud computing. In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice-controlled smart speaker similar to the Amazon Echo. And clearly, these efforts have started to pay off for the company. A seasoned Google executive, Pichai had taken over as CEO as part of a corporate restructuring in 2015, while Larry Page, Google's co-founder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella.

By: PTI | Houston | Updated: April 29, 2017 11:26 AM Google CEO Sundar Pichai. (Reuters) Google’s 44-year-old India-born CEO Sundar Pichai received nearly $200 million in compensation last year, double the amount he got in 2015. Pichai received a salary of $650,000 last year, slightly less than the $652,500 he earned in 2015. But the long-time Google employee, who was named CEO during the company’s reorganisation in August 2015, received a stock award of $198.7 million in 2016, roughly double his 2015 stock award of  $99.8 million. The company’s compensation committee attributed the lavish pay to Pichai’s promotion to CEO and “numerous successful product launches”, the CNN reported. Larry Page, Google’s co-founder, and previous CEO shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella. Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware, and cloud computing, the report said. Also watch: In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice-controlled smart speaker. These efforts have started to pay off for the company. Google’s “other revenues”, a category that includes hardware and cloud services, hit nearly $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter, a gain of about 50 per cent from the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet’s stock has soared this year, pushing it above a $600 billion market cap this week for the first time, the report said. No Comments.

What We Use, 2017 Edition: The stuff Corbin can't live without Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 8:26am PDTApr 28, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Features What We Use Series Article Contents 1 Hardware 1.0.1 Phone: Google Pixel 1.0.2 Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 1.0.3 Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' 1.0.4 Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') 1.0.5 Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) 1.0.6 Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 1.0.7 Smart speaker: Google Home 1.0.8 Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE 1.0.9 Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 1.0.10 Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock 2 Software 2.0.1 Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) 2.0.2 Signal Spy (Android) 2.0.3 InputMapper (Windows) 2.0.4 Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) 3 Conclusion You may recall Android Police's long-running 'What We Use' series, where the fantastic people that work here share the tech (and sometimes non-tech) products they use on a frequent basis. I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police!

I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. JasonIvers Just use Cloudflare... They provide SSL, as well as DDOS protection, etc, for free. It takes basically no work, or even much knowledge, to set it up. Then, if you want to do your own later, you can, but people will be able to use https on the mean time. Artem Russakovskii We already do use Cloudflare, including their SSL, but it's not so simple with our setup for reasons I don't want to explain. We made it work on apkmirror already, and AP is coming. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Da Fuq Agreed, but it's gonna be pretty expensive. New CPU, MB and DDR4 RAM. JD Still cheaper than an Intel setup. Once you consider the performance gain you can't afford to not upgrade Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers. Michael Hazell Must be nice to be able to afford expensive devices like the Pixel. I maintain my stance that there really hasn't been a successor to the OnePlus One since its inception because no future model has come to its price point.

Amazon just announced the Echo Look, a new camera and style assistant From Google Glass to the Apple Newton, a museum in Sweden is shining a spotlight on some of the tech sector’s biggest misses. The Museum of Failure as it’s known, has products from Apple, Sony, Kodak and Google, as well as several other makers, all of which struggled with consumers. The collection covers over sixty “failed products and services from around the world,” according to a description on the museum’s web page. Samuel West, the museum’s curator, advises companies on how to successfully innovate by learning from failure. “A lot of tech failures are because immature technology is launched [such as] Google Glass, Apple Newton,” West told Fox News in an email. A tech product can be marketed “before it actually works and way before it is useful,” he said. But that’s all part of ultimately coming up with a successful innovation. “Innovation always requires an acceptance of failure…if you’re afraid of failure, innovation is impossible,” West added. Here are some of the notable flops from the exhibition, due to open in June in Helsingborg, Sweden. More On: gadgets Crimes are being solved by witnesses without eyes or ears How a fitness tracker could save your life The days of cracked phone screens will soon be over Prison inmates might be getting free tablets for some reason Kodak DC40 digital camera Innovation doesn’t succeed if a company doesn’t embrace emerging business models. That happened with Kodak, an early leader in digital cameras and is probably one of the best examples of innovation that failed. The DC40, manufactured by Kodak, was also branded as the Apple QuickTake 100. (Yes, Apple sold a standalone camera once.) “[Kodak’s] failure was an inability to truly embrace the new business models [that] disruptive change opens up,” according to an annotation attached to the Museum’s DC40 exhibit. “Kodak created a digital camera, invested in the technology, and even understood that photos would be shared online.” What Kodak failed to do was realize that online photo sharing was a new business, “not just a way to expand the [photo] printing business,” according to the annotation. Google Glass Google’s attempt to make smart glasses the next big thing in personal gadgets failed because the technology “still didn’t have any useful applications,” West told Fox News. Privacy concerns, due to the potential for furtive video recording, were also its downfall. Nokia N-gageReuters Despite the failure with consumers, Google Glass has gone on to have somthing of a second life, resonating in the healthcare and medical professions. Nokia N-gage The combination phone and gaming device failed at both, especially when you tried to put it to your ear and use it as a phone. “Poor design and lack of games made it flop. Great idea, lousy implementation,” according to West. Orbitoclast Lobotomy This 1948 technology for performing lobotomies was supposed to make them quicker and easier than before. “The tool was a success but the lobotomy as treatment was a terrible failure,” West said. Harley-Davidson Perfume This was a “brand extension failure” according to West. Bikers were not impressed. Other notable failures include the Apple Newton, which suffered from poor handwriting recognition, questionable utility, and a high price. (Apple did go on to create the iPhone, however.) Another was the Twitter Peek, “the world’s first dedicated Twitter device,” as described on the product’s package. Gizmodo described it as being “so dumb it makes my brain hurt.” Last but not least was the Sony Betamax, one of the most oft-cited flops. “Sony refused to collaborate with other manufacturers, while JVC focused on building a collaborative ecosystem by licensing the VHS format,” according to an annotation attached to the Betamax exhibit. “The classic story of tech innovation failure demonstrates that technical excellence and being first to market is not enough.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under apple ,  gadgets ,  google glass ,  harley-davidson ,  inventions ,  museums ,  nokia ,  sweden ,  Tech ,  twitter Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jeff Bezos close to eclipsing Bill Gates as world's riches...

Not only is Google Maps very detailed and useful with turn-by-turn navigation services, traffic updates, and more, but it is also free and free of ads. This means that users can use the service without worrying that ads might pop up and get in the way. However that could change in the future, assuming that Google’s CEO’s words are anything to go by. Speaking to a Wall Street analyst who inquired about Google possibly turning Maps into a moneymaker, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai replied by saying, “I’m sure you have noticed changes in Google Maps with the last few months.” “If you open Google Maps, you’re traveling or out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more info about what you can do, places to eat and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there overtime as well.” Pichai wasn’t explicit about saying that ads will be coming, but some have interpreted his words to mean just that. Exactly how these ads might surface remains to be seen. It could come in the form of suggested locations that pop up when you are searching around the area, or maybe it could be similar to how Google is serving ads up in search results, but either way we’ll just have to wait and see, but hopefully if and when ads do come to Google Maps, it won’t be intrusive.

We are keen on travelling and looking for new places to have a cup of coffee, buy groceries or just hang out. However, sometimes we may get lost or just don’t know where to go and what is the shortest way to our destination. Luckily for us, we can always stay on track with help of the navigations app! But there occurs another issue. What are the best free navigation apps? Many developers all over the world have spent sleepless nights to create a navigation app that will perfectly match users’ expectations. You may think there is no difference which one to use since they all perform only one main function – helping users find the shortest and fastest way to their destination. However, it’s correct in general, but incorrect in particular. Each app has its own lineament and tries to fit users’ needs better than competitors do. How to choose the most convenient and useful one? Read on the 5 best Android navigation apps list by Stormotion team and find it out! Google Maps The app was exclusively created by Google over a decade ago and was officially launched in 2007. During this time, the company has never abandoned this project, constantly adjusting it to the users’ requests. Now Google Maps is the absolute leader among navigation apps for Android. It has the highest number of downloads – more than 1 billion! This popularity is completely tenable: the app has the user-friendly and intuitive interface, it’s quite accurate and easy to use. However, during the last years, Google Maps more often faces criticism. Why? Let’s take a look at the app’s advantages and disadvantages: Advantages Disadvantages GPS system of Google Maps provides users with the highly detailed information on driving options and traffic dynamics. Some users complain that the app sometimes is slow to load. The app is multifunctional – it helps to build driving routes as well as pedestrian and ones that include the use of public transport. Google Maps doesn’t gather the up-to-the-minute data on unusual conditions (like damaged by a bad weather roads or construction works). Google Maps allows users to download maps of particular areas (up to 120,000 square km) for offline access. Occasionally, the app faces the lack of accuracy and may lead you the wrong route that won’t take you to the destination. Waze Waze is the navigation app-phenomenon that shook the mobile market back at the beginning of the 2010s. The best confirmation of this statement is the fact that in 2013 Google bought Waze for $1.3 billion and integrated some of its functions into Google Maps. Why is it so notable? Because Waze is the most successful and popular community-driven app. It means the app gathers real-time data from open sources by analyzing Waze users’ behavior and their reports regarding traffic jams, accidents, road repairing and other circumstances that may cause troubles while you drive. Waze is also known for its add-ons, which make the driving process easier and more comfortable. For example, you can integrate your Facebook and Foursquare friends to Waze or get the latest information on gasoline prices along your route. So, what Waze users think about the app? Read on: Advantages Disadvantages It offers up-to-date and real-time data about traffic and routes from the drivers just like you. In the area with a little drivers’ activity, the app literally loses its meaning. App has a wide range of cool add-ons, and the most of them can be really helpful. In the area with a high drivers’ activity, the app may display too many icons and distract you from driving. Catchy, bright and fresh app’s design is another reason why many people prefer this app to other. Waze consumes a big amount of battery power as it works constantly (even when it’s not navigating you) and collects data from other drivers. Maps.Me Maps.Me is another example of a convenient and free navigation app. However, it’s quite different from Google Maps and Waze that we have already reviewed. The key idea behind Maps.Me is to provide users with offline navigation. After installing the app, you will be offered to download the map of your country or city and then use it whenever you want even without any mobile internet or wi-fi access. Moreover, there are some additional features available for Maps.Me users. For example, you can use “search” function or bookmark routes for the future trips. The app also has the utter list of places of interest, which is extremely helpful in the urban environment. However, such approach has its own pros and cons. Let’s take a look: Advantages Disadvantages Unlike many offline maps, the app is completely free. Since it offline map, it won’t provide you with real-time traffic information. Turn-by-turn directions are available just like the list of nearby places of interest (Wi-Fi spots, WC and others). Some users say the app works very slowly due to the big offline database. Maps.Me is suitable not only for drivers – along with the car routes app includes walking and cycling navigation. In the developing countries Maps.Me may perform poor detalization. Sygic GPS Navigation This navigation app for Android successfully combines online real-time tracking with the possibility to download maps for the offline usage as well. Moreover, Sygic app has several interesting features that divide this app from others and make it unique. For example, it provides drivers with information about lane traffics, speed limits, the cheapest gasoline in the area and parking spots. At first sight, Sygic seems like a perfect navigation app for drivers. Nevertheless, users also managed to find a few disadvantages. Check it out: Advantages Disadvantages Accurate address data (app’s navigation is based on Tom Tom map data, which is often utilized by emergency and governmental services). Some users complain the app works slowly in the offline mode. Almost perfect 3D navigation with a realistic view of buildings, hills and other surroundings is also one of well-known app’s features. Despite the app is free to download, so as to get the full experience you should pay for a range of additional features. Sygic app also has a helpful lane guidance feature that makes lane maneuvering safer than ever. Some features are also unavailable for the offline usage. Navigon Navigon positions itself as the field leader. The app is not free, however, developers promise to provide you with the comprehensive interface, precise navigation and a broad diversity of useful features.

Google’s developer preview aims to bring Google Assistant voice agent applications to Linux developers. The Google Assistant SDK is initially designed for prototyping voice agent technology on the Raspberry Pi 3 using Python and Raspbian Linux, but it works with most Linux distributions. The SDK lets developers add voice control, natural language understanding, and Google AI services to a variety of devices. Google Home The AI-infused Google Assistant voice agent emerged first on the Linux-based Google Home speaker, and spread to various Android platforms to offer AI voice interactions. Competitors include Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Apple’s Siri. The SDK incorporates the Python version of the gRPC API, an open source remote procedure call (RPC) client. Since gPRC allows you to generate bindings to other platforms, developers could also extend the SDK to port to Windows and Mac platforms, as well as other programming languages including C/C++, Node.js, Java, and Ruby. Raspberry Pi 3 The Google Assistant SDK is free for prototyping use, but requires that you make a deal with Google for commercial deployment. Later this year, “commercial device makers will also be able to use the SDK across a wide range of hardware,” said Google. The SDK release appears to be linked in part to a survey that Google posted for Raspberry Pi developers in January asking them what kind of Google tools they would find most useful. In the survey announcement, Google said that it planned to bring its AI and machine learning technology to the Raspberry Pi in 2017. Deeplocal’s RPi-based, Google Assistant infused Mocktail Mixer (click images to enlarge) The SDK includes samples and documentation, including instructions on how to make a voice-enhanced Mocktail Mixer developed by Pittsburgh-based Deeplocal. Built around a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino board, the open source bartender device lets you order cocktails by voice command, and dispenses jokes with the drinks. The Google Assistant SDK lets you add similar Q&A chichat to other devices ranging from a robot to a smart mirror, says Google. Developers can call upon “Actions on Google” to extend the SDK with new commands. For example, an action could turn on an LED light or set a robot into motion. The voice agent can be summoned with the OK Google hotword or a physical red button made available by Google. Other SDK features include the ability to read transcribed text from user voice input, which can be used to provide additional device functionality. For example, you could scan for happy or sad keywords and change the mood lighting accordingly. Google is currently working on enhancing the SDK with hotword support and companion app integration, among other features, and has established a community development site. There has already been at least one open source project designed to run Google Assistant on a Raspberry Pi using IFTTT. There are many more RPi projects using Alexa. Amazon has a head start over Google, Microsoft, and Apple when it opened its Alexa SDK to device developers. Over the last year, there has been a growing number of smart home and other mostly Linux-based devices that have integrated Alexa voice agents. Google Assistant SDK overview   Further information The Google Assistant SDK developer preview is available for download, initially optimized for the Raspberry Pi. More information may be found in Google’s announcement announcement and on the Google Assistant SDK web page.   Related posts: Google seeks dev feedback for putting AI on Raspberry Pi Google releases Cloud Vision API with demo for Pi-based… Android Wear 2.0 debuts on two LG watches Open source AI voice interface mounts on dashboards Conexant voice board lets you summon Alexa from a Raspberry… How to add Alexa to your Raspberry Pi 3 gizmo Linux-based smart home hubs advance into AI RPi-friendly home automation kit adds voice recognition… Google's Nest buys Linux automation firm, adds five… Google posts Android Auto design guidelines (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Chrome will let you browse pages, obviously, but it's also loaded with hidden hacks that can essentially streamline your internet-browsing experience and digital life. From simple tricks that allow you to send emails from the omnibar (aka address bar) to extensions that you let save images to Pinterest without ever having to go to Pinterest.com, Chrome has everything you could possibly need or want. For instance, here's over 30 tips and tricks we use on a regular basis to get the most out of Chrome. We will update this piece over time with more handy tools and functions as we discover them. Let us know in the comments if you know of one worth including. YouTube TV is now live: What is it and how does it work? 7 best Google Home compatible devices you can buy today Google Home review: A better voice assistant than Amazon Echo? Google Chrome tips and tricks Note: The following tips are for the desktop version of Google Chrome. Sign in to Google Chrome This might sound super obvious, but you really should sign in to the Chrome browser before you even think about using it. Doing so will allow you to save and sync things like your bookmarks, history, passwords, and other settings to your Google Account. Then, you can access them on any device. You can learn more about how to sign in to Chrome on this FAQ page. Make your own profile If you have different Google accounts, like work and personal, you can use profiles to keep your bookmarks and settings separate. You can learn more about how to add a Chrome profile on this FAQ page. Browse in private or delete your history If you don’t want Chrome to save what you visit or download, you can always browse the web privately using Chrome's Incognito mode. You can also delete your history, cookies, and other information - all at once or just some from a specific period of time. Go here to learn more about Incognito mode, or go here to learn about how to delete your history in Chrome. Access Chrome's settings From Chrome, find the hamburger menu or icon with three vertical dots on the upper left, and then select Settings to access Chrome's full list of settings. Or just type chrome://settings/ in your omnibar. Learn basic keyboard commands There are tonnes of keyboard commands, but here are some worth remembering: Ctrl/Command + T opens a new tab Ctrl/Command + W closes your current tab Ctrl/Command + Shift + T opens your last tab Ctrl/Command + L highlights whatever’s in the omnibar Ctrl/Command + Tab moves you a tab to the right Ctrl/Command + Shift + Tab moves you a tab to the left Add a “guest browser” account If you want to let your friend use your laptop but still keep all your browsing info private from them, go to Chrome's settings, and then under People select Add a person. This will let them have their own browsing experience separate from yours. Use the Task Manager You can Chrome’s Task Manager to end memory-hungry pages or see what’s slowing your session down. Go to Chrome's hamburger menu on the left and then select More Tools. From there, click Task Manager. Manage Autofill settings Use your autofill settings to avoid manually entering your address or password or credit card information on a daily basis. Just to Chrome settings, then “Show advanced settings…”, and “Manage Autofill settings” under “Passwords and forms.” Search sites From the omnibar Ever want to search YouTube without going to to YouTube.com? If you go settings, you’ll see a “Manage search engines…” button under the “Search” section. Click it to see a list of sites you can search directly from the omnibar. Chrome will add these automatically, but you can also enter the URL for a site, such as Wikipedia. So, when you type a phrase in the omnibar and then hit tab, you'll go to whatever related Wiki article you wanted to find. This saves you an extra step, as you no longer have to go to a site’s homepage to find what you want. Search your personal Gmail from omnibar Go back to the “Manage search engines…” area, then scroll to the bottom to add a new search engine, and enter the following: “https://mail.google.com/mail/ca/u/0/#apps/%s”. This is Gmail’s search function. You can then make the keyword “gmail.com,” or “mail.google.com”, and from that point on, you can search your email. Do math equations from omnibar The omnibar is amazing. For instance, you can use it as a calculator. Enter 10 x 10 and it will tell you the value is 100. Try it out. It works with any equation too . Google search a phrase by highlighting it You can Google search a phrase directly from your current page by highlighting it. From there, right click or drag it to the omnibar. So, if you highlight the word 'dongles' on a page, and then select 'Look Up', you will effectively Google search the word 'dongles'. Pin a tab Google Chrome has a "Pin Tab" feature. If you're not familiar with it, just keep in mind that browser tabs spawn from left to right. The first tabs you open are located on the left - unless you start moving tabs around. As a result, you probably keep your most important tabs on the left. With that in mind, the Chrome browser offers the ability to lock some of your most-used tabs to the left of your browser and reduces the tabs to icon size so that you can squeeze many of your favourites in a small space. All you have to do is to right-click on a tab and select the "Pin Tab" option. View what you're allowing on certain pages Ever want to see how many cookies a page is deploying or what permissions you’ve given it? Just click the "i" icon or page button next to the URL in the omnibar to view site info including cookies and permissions. It’s also a handy way to allow the page to show popups. Use the “Bookmark Open Pages…” option If you want to save your current browsing session for future reference, press the up arrow, command, and D keys all at once (or right click, then select Bookmarks, and click Bookmark Open Pages). You can then save all your open pages in a new folder. This is handy if you’re researching a subject and want to save all the helpful information you’ve already found. You can also download an extension like OneTab to do the same thing. Reopen your recently closed tabs If you ex out of your window, you can pick up where you left off by going to History from the menu bar (or going to History under the settings on the left of the browser, which can look like a hamburger menu or three-vertical dot icon, and then go to your history. Look for the tabs under Recently Closed, and click it once you find it. You can also go into settings and select “Continue where you left off” under the “On startup” section to relaunch your browser as you left it. Save and edit bookmarks A quick way to manage your bookmarks is to type command+D to add a bookmark. You can also always right click on a page in the bookmarks bar to edit their titles. You can also go to Bookmarks>Bookmarks Manager from the Menu bar to manage all your saved sites and folders. Quickly switch between tabs Hit Control or Command + 1-9 while you're on the omnibar to quickly switch between tabs. Each number corresponds to a page's place in the tab tab above. So, on Mac, Command + 3 will open your third tab. Quickly close tabs Simply right-click on a tab and then select “Close Other Tabs” or “Close Tabs to the Right" to get rid of them fast. Set startup pages If you want Facebook or some other page to appear as soon as you open Chrome, you can set it to automatically launch those pages. Just go to settings, then click the “Set pages” option next to “Open a specific page or set of pages,” and enter the sites you wish to visit right away. Use Chrome as a text editor Instead of using some random note editor on your machine to take notes, use Chrome. Just enter "data:text/html, <html contenteditable>" into the omnibar, and then you can jot something down real quick. Play a game when offline If you try loading a page when you’re offline, and you’ll see a static little T-rex. Once you see it, hit the spacebar, and then it will turn into an endless side-scroller runner game. Drag multiple tabs at once Hold down the Control or Command key and click on all the tabs you want to move in order to move them as one. Use Chrome as a simple multimedia player Click on any multimedia file on your computer and then drag it directly into your Chrome browser window to look at it. Download files to desktop To quickly access a file you downloaded, automatically download it to your desktop. To change where files automatically download, go to settings, then click the Advanced Settings link, and select Downloads. There you can alter where files automatically download to (like desktop). Zoom in or out On a PC, you can zoom in or out on a page by pressing Control while rolling your scroll wheel up or down. You can then click Control-0 to return to the default. On a Mac, you can zoom in and out by pressing Command-plus or Command-minus. Command-0 will go back to default. Go up or down using key commands You can use the spacebar to scroll down on page, and you can scroll back up by pressing shift and the spacebar. Translate everything Chrome has built-in Google Translate, but if you just want to translate a select phrase or passage, install the official Google Translate extension. You can highlight any text and click the little Google Translate icon that sits in the top-right side of your browser screen Cast your screen Casting is baked into Chrome. Just right-click anywhere in Chrome to prompt a pop-up cast window. Or, click the hamburger in the top-right to prompt a pull-down menu and then choose Cast. Go here to learn more about casting from Chrome to your TV. Use a Chrome theme Sick of how Chrome looks? Download a theme from the Chrome store. Just click over to the Theme section and click to install. Compose an email in your omnibar You can write your email up in the omnibar on Chrome and send it from there. Just type “mailto:” followed by the recipients address into your omnibar. It’ll open up the Gmail compose window automatically. From there, you can write your email and hit send. Create desktop shortcuts You can turn a site into a desktop app to speedily access your favourite website. Just navigate to thewebsite, then click the wrench icon, and select “Tools”. From there, click on “Create application shortcuts.” Explore Chrome extensions To get the most out of Chrome, go to the Chrome Web Storevand explore its vast amounts of extensions and apps. The right extensions will improve your web experience. For instance, you can install the Pinterest one so you can directly pin any image you see to your account. Do a barrel roll Type "Do A Barrel Roll" into the omnibar and hit enter. :) Want to know more? Check out our Google hub for related articles.

How to customize Chrome's terrible New Tab page Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 10:02am PDTApr 27, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares139 Applications News Article Contents 1 Removing suggested content 2 Removing recent downloads and offline pages 3 Removing recently-visited bookmarks 4 Show tabs from other devices 5 Turning on the condensed layout 6 Switching to the Chrome Home interface Back in Chrome 54, Google replaced Chrome for Android's New Tab page with a new design that prominently featured suggested content - much like Google Now's feed. To quote Douglas Adams, "This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move." Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. If you're not a fan of Chrome's cluttered New Tab page, there are a few workarounds you can try to make it a bit more usable. You can even mix and match features to create a more personalized design. The below workarounds require enabling or disabling Chrome flags. To do this, navigate to "chrome://flags" (without the quotes), press the menu icon, select 'Find in page,' and type the name of the flag starting with the hashtag symbol. Removing suggested content Removing the suggested articles list is pretty simple. Find the #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Once you do that and re-open Chrome, the list will no longer appear on the New Tab page. Removing recent downloads and offline pages The New Tab page also shows recent file downloads by default, but this is fairly easy to remove as well. Find the #enable-ntp-asset-download-suggestions flag, and set it to Disabled. Then make sure you re-launch Chrome, and it should be gone. In addition, pages you have saved for offline reading show up on the New Tab page. If you want, you can turn this off by disabling #enable-ntp-offline-page-download-suggestions. Removing recently-visited bookmarks By default, Chrome shows bookmarks you have recently visited on the New Tab page. This can also be turned off by disabling the #enable-ntp-bookmark-suggestions flag. Show tabs from other devices As you may know, Chrome syncs your open tabs across your devices, so you can easily pick up from where you left off. There is a hidden flag that adds a 'Tabs from other devices' section to the New Tab Page. The only catch is that suggested articles has to also be turned on, which is a bit of a bummer. To turn it on, make sure both #enable-ntp-remote-suggestions and #enable-ntp-foreign-sessions-suggestions are set to Enabled. Then, reopen Chrome, and your tabs from other devices should appear. Turning on the condensed layout If you do like the suggested content or other features on the page, you still might want to turn on the condensed New Tab page layout. This removes the large space at the top, where the Google logo normally sits, allowing for more content to be visible without scrolling.   Left: Condensed design disabled, Right: Condensed design enabled To turn on the condensed layout, simply enable the #ntp-condensed-layout flag and re-launch Chrome. This is already enabled by default in Chrome Dev, at least on my device, so it may come to Chrome stable in the near future. Switching to the Chrome Home interface Chrome is constantly changing, and there's already another revamp of the New Tab page interface in development. It's called Chrome Home, and it moves the address bar to the bottom of the screen. With this new layout, the New Tab page is accessible by swiping up from the address bar, and it includes navigation icons for Downloads, Bookmarks, and History.    This new design only works on Chrome Dev and Canary for now. To try it out, switch #enable-chrome-home and #ntp-google-g-in-omnibox to Enabled and re-open Chrome. There you have it - a few tips to make Chrome's New Tab page less awful.

George at this rate, They need an 'Of The Hour' section... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Switching what the Bixby button does was possible with an app, but the recent update removes this ability. Nerds go apoplectic with rage against Samsung. Switching to the old design was possible by disabling a few Chrome flags, but the recent Chrome 58 update removes this ability. No outrage yet. Corbin Davenport Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ An EXTRA button, i.e., a button other phones don't even have. Does Samsung have a good reason for locking it into Bixby? It's too early to tell. Shaun39 You should put a sarcasm tag at the end of your clueless comments. EcE An EXTRA button many people reportedly have been pressing accidentally more often than trying to use it. MadMartigan Bingo. They could at least have put it on the other side. As it is, 100% of the time I hit I am trying to turn the volume down. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You'll never admit it, but I guarantee you'd be complaining no matter where they put the button. MadMartigan I think you may be having some trouble reading for comprehension. I'll gladly admit it, as it has been my point all along. Not a fan of Bixby. Not a fan of the button placement. Wouldn't mind at least being able to remap it to make it at least marginally useful rather than just simply in the way. They put the button in a very bad place. Adding insult to injury - they have now disallowed making it at all useful to anyone not inexplicably fond of Bixby. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does. Also, if they put it on the right, I guarantee people would still complain about accidentally pressing it. In other words, you guys will complain about anything as long as it's Samsung. EcE The point you are missing, is the comment you are replying to: "Chrome 58 is still rolling out, so there isn't as many people affected by it (yet). Also having a hardware button you can't customize is a bit more annoying than a Chrome UI change." Having that button which you could be able to disable if Samsung weren't dicks, is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people don't even have yet. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! The nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. EcE Because when someone found a way to change it's behavior, Samsung quickly blocked it. An extra hardware button is more annoying than a home page you can just ignore, period. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And you can use another browser. Nobody's forcing you to use Chrome. You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it. Or just buy a phone without an extra button. That'll show Samsung. Same difference. MadMartigan "You can ignore the button, too. Just don't press it." Proof positive you just straight up refuse to understand that the placement is a problem for some people. "Just not pressing it" is not as simple as you seem to want to make it sound. I've accidentally launched it several times trying to lower the volume on the 8+ and I can only imagine it would be even worse on the S8. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Proof positive you're just a whiny baby. I've accidentally pressed the volume button many times when trying to press the power button, because my hand grabs both sides of the phone to get the leverage to press the power button. As much as it may amaze you to hear this, I survive this heart-rending inconvenience. MadMartigan God forbid anyone express an opinion that doesn't cast Samsung in the best possible light... /s MadMartigan ..and you nerd rage against anyone who thinks it might not be the best thing ever, can we talk about that, maybe? You know, since we're apparently not allowed to discuss the possibility that they might have handled it better? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You implied that the lack of complaints was because Chrome 58 is still rolling out. I pointed out that the nerd rage about the button occurred before people got their phones, thus nullifying your point. Discuss anything you want. MadMartigan Except any possibility that Samsung could have done something better. Apparently we're not allowed to do that without being called names... MadMartigan "If what you hate about it is its location, then you wouldn't complain about not being able to switch what it does." So a bad key placement could not be made at least marginally better by allowing to map to something you might actually someday use... Got it. Your logic is flawless... /s Necdet Ali Özdür How come people don't press other buttons accidentally but​ somehow keep pressing Bixby button all the time? EcE Who said that? Necdet Ali Özdür ... you? EcE Oh yeah? I said: "Bixby is the only button people press accidentally" ... I'm sure I did. and btw, HTC's power button just below the volume buttons is/was (HTC 9/10 and whichever else they did the same) something to complain about as well. Either way, the point here is that having an extra button that cannot be disabled/remapped is more annoying than a change in Chrome most people have not seen yet. Necdet Ali Özdür That doesn't mean those people won't see it, I guess that's the point you are missing. Both decisions can be reversed by respective parties by means of a software update, but people (especially here in Android Police) complain about Samsung the most. EcE Nah, I think we enjoy bi+ching about everything Necdet Ali Özdür Who doesn't? 😂 MadMartigan Possibly due to it's bad placement. Have you been paying attention? Necdet Ali Özdür It's placed where a button could be placed on an all screen phone. Like the rest of them it's on the side. MadMartigan So there's no other place they could have put it? Really? I hope you're actually trying to be dense... Do phones you use not have tops, bottoms, or right sides? Do they have no room at all below where the button is currently placed on the left? Necdet Ali Özdür I hope that next phone you own will have a power button on the bottom and volume buttons on the top. Because those are valid positions to place buttons. Yeah. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It doesn't matter where the buttons are. If it's a Samsung phone, at least 75% of AP commenters will be outraged. MadMartigan ...and the one fanboy will attempt to shout down anyone with a valid opinion regarding how it could have been better. Because to him, Sammy can do no wrong. FWIW: I have not owned a Samsung since the S2 and as this was the first one without the ridiculous home button, I jumped at it. I like pretty much *everything* about the device other than the absurd Bixby-button. MadMartigan lmao. Are you being serious? HTC had power buttons on the top - never once accidentally powered it off. You really cannot accept that the placement may not be optimal for some people? That this is the only place they could have put it? Necdet Ali Özdür It's in a place where majority of current devices have their buttons. Sounds more optimal to me than the places you've suggested. Some people may not like to have it at that place, or not have that extra button at all. But in my opinion it is the best place to place Samsung could've put it. MadMartigan So the right side, where there is currently only one button, would be a worse place for it? They couldn't texture the power button and have the bixby button 1/2 inch below it? That wouldn't be better than the same texture as the volume keys, and right next to them? I mean heck, even if they'd just added a texture to it...that would have been better. Necdet Ali Özdür It is significantly smaller than the volume button (which is a rocker now) which makes it easy to differentiate with a finger. But yeah a texture wouldn't hurt. I agree you on this one. But if it was on the right side, I'm pretty sure people would still complain as much as they do now, claiming they're confusing it with the power button and such. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're complaining because it's a Samsung phone. If this was a button on the Pixel, it could be in the worst possible location and they'd go to the ends of the earth to defend it. MadMartigan Honestly, I would have loved it on the right, in a perfect location to be hit by the finger right above the pinky when needed. Power-index, Bixby two fingers down. Would have, IMO, been perfect. Could have even gone without the texture on that one. Where it is now, you're going after it with your thumb. Until muscle-memory kicks in, it's a crap-shoot where it's going to land initially and unless you expect to have to double-check, you're going in to press - and could easily press the wrong one. It's all personal preference, to be sure, but I do believe they could have appeased far more people by putting it on the right. FWIW - the same complain was leveled at HTC when they placed the power/volume buttons on the same side, though I do not believe the volume was a rocker on that model. Could have been done better. My favorite device was actually the One M7 - which had the power-button on the top. Power-top, volume-right, nothing on the left. Zero possibility of confusion. (Power on the back would have been fine as well - V20 nailed the fingerprint sensor/power on that one.) bekifft There is no good reason for locking hardware functionality away from the user. Don't give them a pass on taking more control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ As I say below, the nerd rage about the Bixby button started before the phone was even widely released, and hit a crescendo before most people even got their phones. This isn't about timing. It's about Google love vs. Samsung hate. MadMartigan Wow. Someone's triggered... Tiuri Elvander I was and am still outraged. Have been since this came up in the review of 58 Beta Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, so far, that makes one of you, vs. the dozens of people who went into a nerd rage about the Bixby button, many of whom don't even have or want the phone. MJ I don't use Chrome a lot to care enough to disable the new tab page crap but why would Google stop users from customizing it? I can do that with Firefox... Address bar at the bottom of the screen? WTF? Michel Sa Address bar at the bottom makes a lot more sense on a mobile phone. Renan In a mobile phone, having the address bar at the bottom of the screen makes a lot of sense MJ No... ipsofact yes... MJ How have I been able to use the address bar on my phone at the top all this time? EcE Magic? ipsofact we never said you could not use the address bar on your phone. But on mobile its a lot quicker and pain free to have it at the bottom. Unless you want to stretch your thumb all the time. MJ Come on... Are you a human? When I hold my phone my thumb is already naturally pointing toward the top of my phone so would need to stretch it to make it to the bottom. Regardless, I happen to have nine other fingers and the on-screen keyboard pops up in the same place anyway. I have been using the address bar at the top of browsers for over 20 years now so don't need to be changing my workflow habits now and just on my phone on top of it. ipsofact typical ive been doing this for 20 years so I wont change the way I work. You know I work with several people with the same mentality.. I have been using the address bar at the top since day 1 but today I changed it to the bottom. Works great and believe me I won't let the old "ive been doing it like this for years" ever stop me. Or just put the phone upside down. it works ;) MJ Change is not the issue... It's change for no good reason or benefit. At least give the user control to change it back. Some unknown God(s) at Google one day just deciding the address bar will now go at the bottom is ridiculous. Microsoft tried that crap on a larger scale with Windows 8. How did that work out for them? ipsofact You can change it back and forth. Its up to the user to decide. So we are not being obligated to do anything. Just given options! :) Which I like. I can decide the whether the bar will go up the top or the bottom. MJ What? LOL The whole article is about Google not allowing users to disable the crap on new tabs. Thanks for your input and have a good day. MadMartigan "It's change for no good reason or benefit." Thankfully, your refusal to see the reason or benefit does not affect the ability of anyone else to. MadMartigan He said it made sense on the bottom - not that it wasn't unusable on the top. Reading is fundamental. FeelThePoveR It depends on the usage. Sometimes I press my hardware buttons accidentally when doing the swipe up gesture on the bottom adress bar in chrome (closing the tab/app or whatever). I'm still loving it though. MadMartigan People still use mobile Firefox?? ipsofact Firefox still use mobile people? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Except for Android and the Play Store (and their dependencies), I'm off all Google apps. I'm sick of the constant BS coming out of Google. I use Dolphin as my browser. If I get frustrated with Android enough, I'll just give up my precious S Pen and give an iPhone a chance. MadMartigan I loved that change and wish they'd bring it to desktop Chrome. Would love a "Google Now" start-page on the desktop. Kieron Quinn I've used iChrome as a Google Now-esque NTP for a while, it used to be a lot better (especially when it actually got Google Now cards via a hidden API) but is slowly getting worse: http://i.imgur.com/vfO7Kfq.png Lindajgomez My last paycheck was $22500 for working 12 hours a week online.Start earning $97/hour by working online from your home for few hours each day with GOOGLE...

Even with multi-user support, Google Home can't create reminders or calendar appointments Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 1:39pm PDTApr 20, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares105 Google Google Home News Videos Google announced multi-user support for Google Home earlier today, but it's only launching in the US right now. This is finally a chance for Google to rectify things and add all those features Home was lacking at launch, and indeed Google has included a few new features. We're still missing some big ones, though. You still cannot create a reminder or add events to your calendar. After going through the setup process for multi-user, Google Home has access to some of your personal account information. That allows you to ask questions about what's on your calendar, view photos tied to your Google Photos account, and so on. However, writing data to your account appears to be a sticking point. If you try to create a reminder or a calendar appointment, Home tells you it can't do that yet, just like it did before. Hopefully the addition of multi-user support will let Google add these very basic features soon. Seriously, adding something to your calendar has to be one of the most common tasks for a human assistant. It's certainly not impossible to do this stuff, either. Assistant on the phone can create reminders and events just fine. Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

I'll make millions (of reminders)! TheScientists I'm kind of amazed someone hasn't already done this. It's the most basic of necessary functionality in an 'assistant'. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ So after posting this yesterday I looked into it, and sadly there's still no official API for creating reminders, and surprisingly no one has made an unofficial one either. So then I extracted the Inbox APK and decompiled it, I'm working my way through the code to see if I can't start pinning something down, but I'm betting they'll release actual support before I manage to do that. TheScientists Kudos to you, sir. I would have thought there would be something of note in the Google app apk? Or maybe some 1/2-assed way to do it via IFTTT. And, no, I wouldn't take that bet. Google is in no rush to do anything. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The problem is that the decompiled source doesn't exactly come across in a way that makes perfect sense. If a Java class isn't named in the manifest, it ends up getting somewhat obfuscated by proguard, so instead of seeing something like ReminderBuilder I end up with something named C12345, and even the classes are built in such a way that an object ends up being built up through multiple classes instead of just in a singular method, so it's complicated. I did look into IFTTT as well yesterday hoping for a quick solution but was disappointed. We'll see how far I get before either finding some options or just giving up out of frustration. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google can't even handle the basics of their own services here.....SAD! lzdking Make Google Great Again! #MGGA mark555055d Such a disappointment. Google better start ramping up the functions on this thing or it will fail. Also, if they do something stupid like releasing a Google home 2 anytime soon, the shit will fly. LondonLeedsFan I thought about Google Home 2 about 3 days after buying this one and realising it doesn't do so much... I can't help but think it's going to happen. mark555055d Yeah... i could totally see them doing something stupid like making a GH2, with bluetooth pairing capability, improving the mics and speaker, charging $30 more for it, and then giving it an "exclusive" software version that allows reminders and calendar support, all while leaving the GH1 back for months due to "hardware differences". LondonLeedsFan IMO something like this should not be on a 1 or 2 year upgrade cycle. If that's how it goes, I'll leave it! Pete Still no assistant on my Nexus 5X in the UK! LondonLeedsFan Have you set phone language to English US and got latest play services? That will basically push it to your phone within 5 minutes. Pete Latest Play Services (even gone for the beta), same with Google app. As for language, tried that & it didn't work, but why should I? They say it's available in the UK and various other manufacturers (Samsung, OnePlus etc) have made it available on theirs, but Google haven't rolled it out to Nexus devices over here yet. A farce. LondonLeedsFan I have a 6P in the UK and I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Strange. Roderick Gadellaa I don't have it on my Moto X 2014 either and I updated the Google app, Play Services and even edited the build.prop. Somehow it's not working for everyone yet. That said, on the Moto X it may be Moto Voice that's the problem because it also prevents Ok Google hotword detection from anywhere but the Google app itself - it doesn't even work in Google Now On Tap although the searchbar says "Say OK Google". Leonardo Baez create reminder to bitch about you. :,D brian. Careful, she'll turn that insult on you... sbeaulieu The biggest problem assistant got is support. Only one country(officialy). dcdttu Gotta have one before the other, maybe. So that's what they hopefully are going to do next. pfmiller Once you can distinguish between users that's all you should need for both reading and writing appointments. I'm wondering if they are not fully confident in the reliability of the multiple user recognition, so they figure implementing read-only functions is safer while they work on getting the reliability up. dcdttu Once you can distinguish between users isn't all you need for reading/writing appointments....you've got to actually code that process, too. That's likely what they're doing now. So far in my testing at my house, it's quite good at knowing the different voices in our household. I wouldn't see their lack of confidence being a problem, honestly, because before the multi-user features were enabled, you could get personal information off Google Home for one user. Adding more than one user, even if it's giving the info to the wrong person, doesn't seem to be any worse. pfmiller My assumption was that they already have the code for writing data to their services since it's already done in every other application. That part of the problem isn't exactly novel. denisu So, am I right in saying it can only make calendar disappointments? elchuby Can't even do that.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because they're a bunch of overpaid prima donnas who think they're geniuses but can't even match what a simple diligent grunt coder can do. M6 Over 90% of those grunt coders you mention probably couldn't write a simple service that serves a 'hello world' webpage at the thousands of QPS that Google's least popular services have to handle. Most of the work done to spin up such a service are done by SREs not SWEs. This is why start ups can add features so quickly. They simply don't have that many users and can worry about scalability after they get popular, and they have months if not years to work out a scalable solution in the meantime. Also, most grunt coders that add features quickly end up accumulating vast amounts of technical debt in the code they write. Morten Ulv Readers of Android Police are highly trained in pitchforking and kneejerk reactions. No critical thought allowed here, get out! Jimjames Esson Well said,, Google to me ,if i have a Rheumotolgy appointment i simply use Google Calendar..!! Easy peasy lemon sqeasy..lol Blake What's an SRE? M6 https://landing.google.com/sre/ Blake Thanks! This is really cool. I'm almost done with my CIS degree so this really interests me. Is this something that's mostly done at Google or a more wide ranging field? I guess I could just Google that lol M6 Similar in some ways to DevOps at other companies, but Google has its own unique take. Petr Faitl I highly suspect that the answer is a highly political. No doubt it's product managers who can't agree with privacy gurus to prevent a few pranksters (i.e. one's kids) adding events to your calendar. abqnm If I hired an assistant and he or she couldn't add appointments to my calendar, I'd fire that motherfucker on the spot. I guess it must be time to get jobs at Google. Because they sure as shit don't know what an assistant is or what they are supposed to be able to do. Morten Ulv I'm sure they are not aware of the problem and that you would totally be fix it in 5 minutes. That's how it is, I'm sure! Lateef Alabi-Oki I'm just glad that the multiuser support works as well as it does. It hasn't failed in distinguishing the voices in my household. My spouse told it to show pictures from Google Photos and it executed. It's truly magical. Forgive my honeymoon phase. I'll be back to bitching in a day or two. makapav The next thing Google needs to enable us family sharing of all pictures and albums instead of doing it one by one. mustbepbs Still can't even add time to an existing fucking timer. Seriously, this company has the weirdest priorities. makapav Stickers FTW! Lars Jeppesen Who cares mustbepbs I do, because when I want to add a few minutes to a kitchen timer, I have to cancel the current one and create a new one with the new time. Kitchen timers from fuckin Dollar General have this "feature". abc He does. As he just said. Duder12 Google literally just tackled the biggest hurdle. Its all game over from here on out for the competition. bozzykid Considering you can hardly do anything with the multi-user support, it isn't even clear if it truly works. Martin Still don't get the point of this trash... If it can't make a simple reminder or cal app... What for people use it? Weather? Time? When you are surrounded or 10 more gadgets doing the same (watch, phone, tv, Pc and many more)... This is why I am never too exited when Google releases something new, it's never good, not even close to what they promise it is going to be... :) Matt Terk I have 3 devices, whole home music is wonderful along with all the assistant functions and control of all my smarthome devices. It would be hard to live without it now. boop It's the cheapest cast-enabled speaker I know of and it works fantastically. The voice commands for pulling up music are also best-in-class. I have a few smart home devices as well and virtually any combination of words construable as a command mumbled from anywhere in the room will do what I want. I doesn't do everything it ought to but it does quite a lot and does it exceptionally well. Ryan Music, pairing it with Smartthings to be a home controller, etc. I USED to use it for my shopping list, which was great. But they broke that function just recently. Nicholas Conrad People I think don't understand what Google Home is for. It's not an Assistant appliance, it's a good (admittedly not great) chromecast speaker at an entry-level price point. Assistant baked in is gravy, but not the primary use-case. It's basically only there for Google to farm Assistant interactions to jump-start their ML dataset. jdrch Google Home: a solution in desperate search of a problem. Deeco AP is the biggest Android media site, please make articles about all the short comings of Google and shame them until we are heard. Too much crap going on itsatrap Why people buy this thing? Morten Ulv Because these small (but important) issues will get ironed out and Google has a much better potential than Amazon at nailing it. Lars Jeppesen I love mine - I'm sorry you can't figure out why it could be useful. Ryan I got mine on discount, so that helped. But I use it as a voice control for my smart-home features and to play music. JG What about Hangouts? I'm assuming since you said it can't yet write to the account, could it at least read my incoming Hangouts to me? davidofmidnight never forget... A re-review of Google Home, 7 months in. pic.twitter.com/N5bHZg2iTk— Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) March 20, 2017 trickytree1984 Support for exchange calendars is just as important. Most of the world don't use one personal Google calendar for their work and home life Navarr Barnier I'm assuming that MU was a blocker ticket, and they just pushed it out as quickly as they could - so reminders and appointments would be a WIP now that the blocker is out of the way. Surely.. right? right? Jonathan Sorry, but I just don't care about not having this feature, and I don't think many average users do either. But it wouldn't be a post about the Home if AP didn't gripe about it! Ryan Id use it daily, just like how I used the shopping list daily. Its a pretty basic feature that most people use (which is apparently by the unlimited competing choices for calendar and todo apps). Jonathan I agree that it's a basic feature that seems simple enough to execute and should have been implemented from the start​. I just don't think that many people are clamoring for it in their Bluetooth speaker outside of the AP sphere. And it's just getting silly and petty that the AP writers mention it in 95% of the articles they write​ about it. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ The Home isn't just some Bluetooth speaker. It's SUPPOSED to be an assistive device that currently doesn't do the most basic tasks. I set reminders constantly across my phone, my watch, and in my car. It drives me crazy that I still can't do this on what is marketed as being the flagship device for Google Assistant. Ryan Or place items in Keep, like it used to be able to do. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I would love to be able to add items to ANY list in Keep. When my wife and I organize parties we use shared lists in Keep and it would be great to just add things as we talk about them. Stephen Cunningham I cant' get over Google taking the shopping list out of Keep. They are walking backwards not forward. I was hoping you would be able to add to any Keep list or add a note to Keep. Mike Jones i would like to add calendar appointments and i would like to add another minute to a timer too but that doesn't kill Home for me. i have a lot of home automation and i get a ton of use out of that. i just had a scare the other night where i thought i heard something in my house right as i was getting into bed. "google turn on the lights" and my house lit up like daytime.... it made it simple to check out the house. papastevez Can't cast videos from google play movies yet either. ಠ_ಠ Follow Android Police 1.5M 466k 142k 112k Latest Deals 11 [Deal Alert] New dual-sim international unlocked Galaxy S8 (G950FD) on eBay, $730 for Exynos and $820 for Qualcomm 2017/04/29 3:02pm PDTApr 29, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Get a refurbished unlocked T-Mobile Galaxy S7 (SM-G930T) for $279.99 on eBay 2017/04/29 1:10pm PDTApr 29, 2017 14 [Deal Alert] Get the new BLU R1 Plus for just $109.99 ($50 off) as part of Amazon's Deal of the Day 2017/04/29 7:36am PDTApr 29, 2017 14 [Deal Alert] Ecobee3 thermostat is now just $176.16 at Amazon ($72 off) 2017/04/28 5:58pm PDTApr 28, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Get your weekend started with 18 temporarily free and 23 on-sale apps 2017/04/28 2:21pm PDTApr 28, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

It’s the end of another busy week around the tech world, and there’s been no end of intriguing announcements, exciting rumors, and eye-opening insights. But don’t worry if you think you might have missed something, for 7 Days is here again to walk you through the week’s top tech news. Our journey begins this week in Canada, where Lyrebird announced its development of a speech synthesis API that promises to create a realistic, 'emotional' copy of anyone's voice after hearing them speak for just one minute, raising some interesting ethical issues. Meanwhile, AT&T announced upgrades to its 4G network - including improvements that some other carriers already made months ago - and branded them as "5G Evolution". That's nothing but a meaningless marketing term designed to 'wow' clueless consumers into believing that AT&T is technologically superior to its rivals - and the company was widely mocked for its foolish approach. Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, announced plans to eliminate Title II net neutrality rules for broadband connections in the US. A vote on the proposal will be held on May 18. uTorrent is the world's most popular BitTorrent client, and is currently distributed as a standalone application - but the next major version will run in users' default web browser, promising an improved user experience, and a broader range of features. The developers of popular media center app Kodi spoke up about the prospect of using "low-level DRM" to deter piracy. While the app is not designed to enable piracy, it has become a firm favorite among those who download copyrighted content without paying for it, thanks to its flexible, open source design. The European Court of Justice ruled this week that selling media player hardware with software configured to enable or facilitate piracy is now illegal. Music streaming service Spotify is preparing to build "a category defining product akin to Pebble Watch, Amazon Echo, and Snap Spectacles". Little is known about the device, which will be the company's first foray into hardware development. Amazon unveiled its latest hardware on Wednesday: the Echo Look, a virtual "style assistant" built into a camera-equipped device that will help you to choose the perfect outfits, and shop for new ones - on Amazon, of course. Facebook announced a huge expansion for the 'lightweight' version of its Messenger app, which it launched last year. Messenger Lite is now available in 132 new markets around the world. AMD revealed its latest professional-class workstation graphics card, the Radeon Pro Duo. Equipped with two Polaris-based GPUs, it promises a monstrous 11 teraflops of graphics processing power. Will 2017 finally be the year of Linux on the desktop? Well, it's probably not going to oust Windows anytime soon - but Ubuntu 17.10 is shaping up to be a major upgrade. Moving on - from Ubuntu, to Uber... It emerged this week that the global ride-sharing service had continued to track users' devices, even after they'd uninstalled its app. Given Uber's history of shady practices, this didn't exactly come as a great shock to many people, but the company insisted that it did not deliberately infringe users' privacy, and that the 'fingerprinting' technique it used was intended to prevent fraud. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly reprimanded Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick for violating the App Store's rules - but while few were surprised by Uber's actions, many people expressed their considerable disapproval over the fact that Uber faced no consequences for those actions, pointing out that smaller app developers would have been kicked off the store immediately. On Monday, Apple released its fourth wave of developer betas for iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5 Sierra, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. A fifth developer beta for the latest version of iOS arrived on Thursday. Password management service provider LastPass said an issue with its two-factor authentication when using Google Authenticator has been fixed. According to researchers at Check Point, nearly two million devices may now be infected with malware from apps downloaded via the Google Play Store, the first of which was uploaded in November 2016. The frequency of Android security issues certainly strengthens BlackBerry's case for a 'hardened' version of Android 7.1 Nougat. TCL's latest BlackBerry handset, the KEYone, promises "unparalleled security", and after launching in London this week, it will go on sale in the US and Canada on May 31. The long, slow rollout of the latest Android OS updates has continued in recent days, reaching another handful of devices: Android 7.1.1 heads to Sony's Xperia XZ and Xperia X Performance T-Mobile announces upcoming Android 7.0 rollout for Galaxy Note5 Galaxy S6 and S6 edge get Android 7.0 in Canada, and on Verizon Android 7.0 now available for Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on US Cellular Samsung's Galaxy S8 flagships continued to make headlines this week: The always-on home button won't suffer from screen burn-in Pre-orders easily beat the Galaxy S7 Galaxy S8 is surprisingly expensive for Samsung to build An imperfect solution, but you can once again remap the Bixby button to other functions Samsung confirmed that it will "launch a new flagship phone in the second half" of this year, having previously said that it plans to offer "a better, safer, and very innovative [Galaxy] Note8". Like the disastrous Galaxy Note7, Samsung's new Galaxy S8 flagships feature the company's dual-curved displays, which wrap around the left and right edges of each device. But Samsung is now rumored to be working on a display that curves into all four edges of a handset, giving a screen-to-body ratio of 98%. You wouldn't want to drop that phone onto a sidewalk... Samsung worked closely with Qualcomm to develop the Snapdragon 835 chipset used in its Galaxy S8 and S8+. The two companies are now said to be working together on the next-gen 'Snapdragon 845' processor, destined for the Galaxy S9. Long before the S9 arrives, Google will release its second-generation Pixel handsets, at least one of which will apparently use the Snapdragon 835. LG launched its new G6 flagship in India, taking on the Galaxy S8 with lower prices and a substantial cashback offer. Chinese manufacturer Gionee revealed its new M6S Plus, featuring an upper-mid-range Snapdragon 653 processor, 6GB RAM, a 6-inch 1080p display, and a massive 6020mAh battery. ZTE's Max XL launched in the US on Boost Mobile, priced at $129.99. Running Android 7.1.1 Nougat, it has an octa-core Snapdragon processor, 2GB RAM, a 13MP camera, and a generously-sized 3,990mAh battery. Pretty decent specs for that price! T-Mobile will soon be launching the Coolpad Defiant in the US. The Android 7.0 handset will offer entry-level specs at a price that's likely to be under $100. Lenovo is reportedly preparing to shut down its ZUK Mobile business - but its spirit may well live on, as the company is said to be bringing its ZUI interface to some of its Moto devices. Japanese manufacturer NuAns said in February that it was ditching Windows 10 Mobile for its next handset, in favor of Android 7.1 Nougat. The Neo Reloaded looks similar to its Windows-based predecessor - including its stylish range of covers, in a combination of materials, such as denim, leather, stone and wood. The new Android handset has been available to pre-order in Japan for several weeks, but NuAns is now offering it internationally through a crowdfunding campaign, priced from $355. Microsoft updated the beta version of its Arrow Launcher for Android devices, adding a wide range of new features, including Android for Work support. Vizio revealed its new range of XLED TVs, priced from $799.99 for the 50-inch M-series model, up to $3,499.99 for the 75-inch P-series. The new TVs include voice support through the Google Assistant. It also announced new soundbars, starting from just $79, and a $199 wireless speaker. HP described its new DreamColor professional displays as "game-changing" - but you'll need deep pockets to afford the $3,999 31-inch 4K model. Acer announced its new gaming monitors and notebooks, including a Predator gaming Ultrabook, which features an odd placement for the keyboard, in order to accommodate a transparent glass trackpad. Acer also debuted its latest range of more 'conventional' Windows 10 devices, including notebooks and 2-in-1s. Acer said that it will launch new Windows Mixed Reality headsets "later this year" for consumers and businesses. My colleague, Rich Woods (yep, that's him grinning above), had the opportunity to try out the company's Development Edition headset - check out his impressions of the head-mounted display here. Microsoft released new firmware for its Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 - but only for those machines running its latest Windows 10 Creators Update. The company also launched a 'graduation sale' offering discounts on a wide range of products, including up to $150 off the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft published its latest quarterly earnings report on Thursday, revealing a chunky 26% drop in Surface revenue - hardly surprising, given that its Surface devices are now 18 months old, and completely outclassed by newer Windows 10 machines. As in previous quarters, Microsoft's greatest successes came from its Cloud and Office businesses, helping it to bring in $5.7 billion in net income on revenue of $23.6 billion. There was healthy growth in its Windows business too. But, unsurprisingly, it was another catastrophic quarter for Microsoft's Windows phone business. It brought in just $5 million (yes, million - that's not a typo) in phone hardware revenue during the entire quarter, compared with $1.4 billion during the same quarter two years ago. Microsoft maintains that its phone platform is "alive and well", because it's still shipping Windows 10 Mobile builds - but it's rolling those builds out to a tiny number of devices, and its work on the OS has now been separated from the main Windows 10 Development Branch. On Wednesday, Microsoft began rolling out the Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update - but just 13 handsets are officially supported. The update brings a handful of new features and improvements, but major additions that were previously promised did not make it into the update. Older handsets can still get the Creators Update via the Windows Insider Program, but Microsoft has made it absolutely clear that it will be offering no support or assistance for those devices, so if you get in trouble, you're on your own. The latest data from AdDuplex, published this week, revealed that almost 61% of Windows 10 Mobile devices are eligible to upgrade to the Creators Update, but that still leaves a huge proportion of handsets unsupported, in addition to all of the Windows Phone 8.1 devices that Microsoft made little effort to upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, even though they were previously eligible. On Friday, Microsoft released its latest Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview, build 15208 to the Fast ring. As with its other recent Mobile builds, that one is from the 'feature2' Development Branch, rather than Redstone 3. It also rolled out Windows 10 preview build 16184 to PCs in the Fast ring - and yes, that is a Redstone 3 build, and it includes support for a major new feature: the My People communications experience that was originally due to arrive as part of the Creators Update. The fixes and known issues for that new PC build can be found here. Additionally, Windows 10 build 15063.250 made its way to PCs that have upgraded to the Creators Update, but which aren't on the Insider Program. Microsoft discontinued its Band 2 wearable device last year, but it's now supporting its hardware partners in bringing their own devices to market. On Monday, it revealed a new wearable on the way from German manufacturer TrekStor, running Windows 10 IoT Core. Microsoft is working with audio equipment specialist Harman Kardon on a new smart speaker, the 'Invoke', which will use its Cortana digital assistant. An update to the Cortana app on Android revealed that the Invoke will support Spotify, and numerous other music services. We've known for a while that Microsoft is planning to bring its full Office 2016 desktop applications to the Windows Store. Listings for those applications have already appeared in the Store, under some rather delicious codenames. A flaw in Microsoft Word was able to be exploited by hackers for several months, while the company continued to investigate it. Microsoft upgraded its Azure Media Player this week, with accessibility improvements, new plug-ins, a fresh skin, and more. It also introduced a new 'Billing Reader' role to its cloud platform, as well as adding a new Invoice API. LinkedIn passed a major milestone, reaching over 500 million members - an increase of 67 million in the last twelve months. Microsoft, which acquired LinkedIn last year for $26.2 billion, announced its plans to integrate the professional networking platform with Dynamics 365. Microsoft's Xbox platform also celebrated a big milestone, with over 500 ID@Xbox games now available on Windows 10 and Xbox One. The Xbox Insider Beta Ring got its first preview of the Version 1705 update on Friday, while the Alpha Ring received the very latest preview release, build 15063.3033, a day earlier. It was an exciting week for the Xbox One Backward Compatibility program, with three more Xbox 360 titles added on Tuesday, followed by another six on Thursday, including Dead Space 2 and 3. Perhaps the biggest gaming news of the week came from Activision, which released the first official trailer for Call of Duty: WWII. It looks absolutely incredible - like many other gamers, I can only hope it's worth the long wait... Battlefield 1 got a substantial update, adding new platoons, more weapons, and numerous other improvements. Here's a blast from the past: if you're old enough to remember the original Tomb Raider, you can relive those good times with a new browser-based version of the 1996 game, with unlocked FPS. Looking ahead, Capcom revealed new details about its upcoming game, Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite. The legendary fighting series will shake things up a bit for its 2017 release, introducing a 2-vs-2 format, Infinity Stones, and more. Nintendo revealed that it sold 2.74 million Switch consoles in its first month, and it expects sales to total at least 13 million by April 2018 - potentially matching, or even exceeding, lifetime sales of its older Wii U. Nintendo also announced its latest handheld console, the 2DS XL, featuring larger displays than its predecessor. The older 2DS will remain on sale, but the new model will cost almost twice as much. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week in the fast lane, as Microsoft announced the upcoming launch of a new Hot Wheels expansion pack for its Xbox One exclusive motorsport game, Forza Horizon 3. I can't wait! Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Boyd Chan published his detailed review of the NOMU S30, a rugged Android smartphone that offers IP68 dust- and water-resistance, a very large 5000mAh battery, and plenty of storage, at a surprisingly decent price. It's not a perfect handset, but it's pretty good! And Timi Cantisano got his game on, as he reviewed Mr Shifty on the Nintendo Switch. He found it to be surprisingly good fun, if a little silly in places, and the graphics left a lot to be desired. But if you're on the lookout for an enjoyable title on Nintendo's compact console, make sure you check out that review. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple’s Echo Competitor Will Reportedly Look Like A Mac Pro By Tyler Lee on 04/28/2017 17:44 PDT Following the success of the Amazon Echo, we started hearing rumors that companies such as Apple and Google could follow suit. Google indeed did launch their own take in the form of the Google Home, but Apple’s version has yet to surface. We have heard that the company is close to finalizing a design, and now more details have surfaced. In a tweet by Mashable’s Jen Ryall, she shares additional details about Apple’s Echo competitor that were provided by Sonny Dickson. According to those details, Apple’s Echo competitor is expected to feature a design that is in the style of the Mac Pro. Chances are it won’t be quite as big or look exactly the same, but there will apparently be some stylistic similarities. More claims from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor: – Think Mac Pro style. – Same style UE boom mesh. – Possible release WWDC. 2/2 — Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 It will sport a concave top with controls, a speaker mesh portion covering it all that is similar to the UE Boom’s mesh, and that it will most likely be launched at WWDC 2017 which kicks off this coming June. We know that Apple has used WWDC to launch new products before so it wouldn’t really be surprising to see them do it again. We can only assume that it will be powered by Siri, and since it is WWDC, perhaps Apple could even announce and share plans on how developers could potentially help to create “skills” for the device like what is being done with Amazon’s Alexa, but until then take it with a grain of salt.

That marks his third straight year getting nine-figure pay -- a rare accomplishment even at well-paying technology companies and virtually unheard of in other industries. Since he became CEO in 2015, Pichai has moved to give Google more control over two critical fields: artificial intelligence and cloud. He oversaw a 17.8 percent jump in Google’s core ads business last year, while also boosting its revenue in cloud and hardware, a long-sought goal of the company. Pichai’s 2016 compensation consisted mainly of 273,328 Class C shares that vest quarterly through 2019 if he remains on the job. The award was granted about six months after the tech business announced it would reorganize into holding company Alphabet. As part of the transition, Pichai was tapped to lead Google, taking the reins from Larry Page who became chief executive of the parent entity.© Anders Melin and Mark Bergen BC-GOOGLE-CEO-PAY It wasn’t the first time following in Page’s footsteps led to big payouts for Pichai. In 2015, he got about $100 million in reported compensation after he was promoted to senior vice president of products and took over many of Page’s responsibilities overseeing areas such as search and ad products. That made him one of the highest-paid U.S. executives that year, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. His biggest pay package that can be gleaned from filings came in 2014. He got 442,424 shares worth about $250 million in August that year, shortly before his promotion. The stock will be fully vested in 2018. Since Alphabet wasn’t required to disclose his compensation at the time, filings don’t reveal why he received such a large grant. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the award. Alphabet also didn’t disclose any salary or cash bonus paid to Pichai in 2014. The Mountain View, California-based company typically grants equity awards to top bosses once every two years, a strategy it has said “encourages executives to take a long-term view of the business.” Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat got a $39.1 million pay package for 2016, most of it in a stock award that vests through 2019. © Anders Melin and Mark Bergen BC-GOOGLE-CEO-PAY Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The Math Missus (aka Sarah Smellie) gets a lesson in AI from Google-guy Nithum Thain By Sarah Smellie, CBC News Posted: Apr 28, 2017 10:00 PM NT Last Updated: Apr 28, 2017 10:00 PM NT Nithum Thain is a researcher for Google technology incubator Jigsaw. (Sherry Vivian/CBC) Related Stories The Math Missus: Gaming the game shows The Math Missus: are you a math person? When it comes to understanding artificial intelligence, we have a unique advantage here in St. John's. We have Nithum Thain. Thain is a research fellow at Jigsaw, a tech incubator launched by Google and owned by Alphabet, Google's parent company. Jigsaw's aim is to battle threats to human rights and free speech using technology. Its projects include a Google Chrome extension which alerts users when sites are trying to lift their passwords. It was originally developed to protect Syrian activists from hackers. Thain works remotely for Jigsaw from St. John's, looking at how artificial intelligence could help solve the problem of online abuse. In particular, he's been using AI to study patterns of abuse among Wikipedia editors. We caught up with Thain at Common Ground Coworking and asked him to help us understand what artificial intelligence is. We also asked him if there really is anything to fear — if it's really possible that artificially intelligent robots could somehow overthrow us and take over the world. It was supposed to be a joke. But ... his answer isn't "No." Are today's intelligence chatbots leading a future of terrifying Terminators? Is this your first lesson from The Math Missus? Here's your chance to catch up on the series! In Part 1, the Math Missus dispels the notion of a "math person". In Part 2, we show you how to game the TV game shows by understanding the math that underlies popular games like Plinko and Let's Make a Deal.

I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. Hardware Phone: Google Pixel You may recall from my introduction post that I was using a Nexus 5X. At the time, it was definitely the best phone I had ever used. The build quality was decent, but it was more than fast enough for my needs, the front-facing speakers were fantastic, and the camera was amazing. But all good things come to an end, and my 5X suffered the famous bootlooping bug that so many other 5X owners have experienced. Being on Project Fi, and not really wanting to switch, I coughed up the money for a 32GB 5" Pixel. And while it has certainly been a great device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Android phone, I still think it's overpriced. For those interested, I'm using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case. In addition to the Pixel, I also own a Microsoft Lumia 550 running Windows 10 Mobile. I bought it a few months before my 5X died (mostly to play around with Windows 10 Mobile), and it ended up being my daily driver for roughly two weeks while I waited for my Pixel to ship. The lack of any Google services - especially Hangouts - means I can't really use it in place of an Android phone. But it does work just fine as a backup two-factor authentication device. Tablet: Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Most mainstream Android tablets hover around 9-10 inches, such as the Pixel C, the Tab S3, and the ASUS ZenPad I reviewed a while back. But I prefer 8.0-8.5" tablets, leaving me with few options that weren't outdated. Currently, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, and it's pretty great for what I need. Samsung has yet to update this to Nougat (and it will probably be a while), so I flashed LineageOS 14.1 on it. The Exynos 5420 processor does slow down occasionally, usually while multi-tasking or trying to play 1080p YouTube videos, but it's still plenty fast for most tasks. The Google Play Movies and Netflix apps don't play video at HD though - I assume because of some DRM restriction with Lineage. Desktop PC: 'Enterprise' My current desktop computer is my first custom-built PC, named 'Enterprise' (I name all of my computers after ships from Star Trek). It has an AMD Athlon X4 860k processor, Gigabyte GA-F2A68HM-H MicroATX motherboard, 420W EVGA power supply, and 16GB of RAM. I've recently upgraded my graphics card to an XFX Radeon RX 470. For storage, I have a 256GB boot SSD and a 1TB hard drive for storing games and backups. As for the rest of my setup, I'm using a simple Dell USB keyboard with a Logitech G402 mouse. The keyboard is pretty nice, despite the low cost, and the mouse is quite comfortable. I've just replaced my previous dual-monitor setup (consisting of an old 1080p display and an ancient VGA monitor) with a Dell U2913WM ultra-wide panel, which has been fantastic so far. Seriously, playing games at ultrawide is amazing. Since originally building it last year, I've swapped out the original case for the APEVIA X-QBER White enclosure, seen in the above picture. I'm not a fan of the windows, but I love that the case can flip open for easy access. Laptop: Dell Latitude 3340 ('Defiant') Before I decided to build my first computer (the PC in the last section), I had a Surface Pro 2 as my workstation. The concept of having one device to serve as my tablet, laptop, and desktop PC seemed great. I didn't even mind that it was a bit heavy - but I did mind the battery life. I'm not sure if it was Windows, the battery capacity, or the fact that I bought it used, but the Pro 2 would barely last a few hours on most days. I sold the Surface less than a year after I initially bought it, and decided to go with a normal boring laptop. My priorities were battery life, the ability to be upgraded, and durability - things my Surface Pro weren't very good at. I eventually stumbled upon a Dell Latitude 3340 for $200 on eBay, with a 13.3" 1366x768 display and a Core i5-4200U. Being a laptop designed for use in schools, it was pretty durable and almost every component could be replaced. I bought it, and spent another $100 swapping out the hard drive for a Samsung Evo 850 SSD and upgrading the RAM to 12GB. I also put a Stormtrooper decal on the back, because every laptop needs stickers. In short, I'm pretty happy with it. The laptop isn't thin by any means, but the battery life is solid and it's plenty fast for my needs. And after I replaced the spinning hard disk with an SSD, it has become dead silent (except during intense workloads). The resolution isn't great, but that's really my only complaint. Smartwatch: Huawei Watch (1st generation) Unlike some of the other writers here at Android Police, I still like the idea of smartwatches. I was an early adopter of Android Wear, and I loved diving into the underlying Android system. I bought a refurbished Huawei Watch a few months ago to replace my original LG G Watch. I also own a first-gen Moto 360, which has unfortunately stopped working, and a Gear Live that needs a new watchband. Besides being a little thicker than I would like, the Huawei Watch is definitely a great device. I don't really care that it's missing NFC or LTE, but I wouldn't mind the digital crown that some of the newer Android Wear watches have. Camera: Sony Alpha a5000 I know as much about cameras as I do cars - that is to say, not very much. Until I started working for AP, I had only used smartphones and sub-$50 digital cameras to take photos. So I consulted David to help pick a new camera, and I ended up with the Sony Alpha a5000. I've only had this camera for about a week, so I can't say much about it yet. It takes pictures. The a5000's Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity is especially cool - I can tap the camera to my Pixel and instantly transfer photos (which are then backed up to Google Photos). The Wi-Fi connectivity also allows me to remotely take photos with my phone as the viewfinder. I've used this several times already to take pictures of birds flying up to a nearby bird feeder. All of the photos in this post (except the picture of the camera) were taken on the a5000, so feel free to rage about my lack of photography skills leave constructive feedback in the comment section. Smart speaker: Google Home I initially bought a Google Home shortly after it was released, to replace an old set of iPod speakers I was using with a Chromecast Audio. I primarily use the Home as a wireless speaker, and it's pretty good at that. I don't really care for most smart home products, but I did buy two WeMo Smart Plugs on sale so I could control two lamps in my room. Initially, these only worked through Google Assistant's IFTTT integration, but Google added native support for WeMo products a few months ago. I'll admit, the Google Home still seems half-baked. Most of my complaints about it from January are still valid, especially not being able to set reminders. I used the shopping list feature quite a bit, but Google basically ruined that. Microphone: Blue Snowball iCE I've been on the Android Police podcast for a while now, on a somewhat-infrequent basis (usually due to technical issues). My $11 headset I use for games wasn't really going to cut it, so I bought the Blue Snowball iCE condenser microphone. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The quality is very good and it's fairly portable. However, the microphone does occasionally disappear from Windows (I'm pretty sure that's Windows' fault), and the red light on the front is rather bright. As you can see in the above picture, I covered that up with some duct tape. Webcam: Logitech HD Pro C920 Another item I bought primarily for the AP Podcast was a webcam - Logitech's HD Pro C920 camera. In most cases, video calling is limited to 720p, but it can record and take photos at 1080p. Supposedly it works at 1080p with Skype for Windows, but I haven't tested that. Sample shot with the HD Pro C920. I don't really have any complaints about this webcam. It does webcam things. Charging dock: iKits 10-Port charging dock I have a ton of electronics that charge over USB. So a few months ago, I tried to become a bit more organized and replace my mess of charging adapters and cables with a single dock. After looking at a few on Amazon, I settled on iKit's 10-port charging dock. And it's seriously awesome. As you can see in the above picture, it has six normal 5V1A ports and four 5V2.4A ports. With this, I can charge my tablet, phones, camera, and even my Nintendo DSi and 3DS (with this cable). The primary advantage is that the dock only needs one two-prong outlet, so you don't have to use separate wall adapters for every single device. If you have a bunch of products that charge over USB, I definitely recommend this (or another dock like it). Software Most of the apps and programs I use on a daily basis are pretty popular. Chrome for browsing the web, Google Photos for image backups, Photoshop CS6 for photo editing, etc. That being said, there are a few apps/programs I use that you may not have heard of. Sublime Text (Windows/Mac/Linux) Sublime Text has been my main text editor for a few years now. Unlike Atom Editor and Visual Studio Code, it doesn't run inside a web shell, but still has plenty of plugins and themes. It supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for dozens of languages, so it's pretty versatile. I primarily use it when I'm working on Chrome extensions and Python scripts, and I don't think I've ever had a single problem. You can buy it for $70 from Sublime's site - the license works across platforms. Signal Spy (Android)    This is a pretty cool utility for Android, available on the Play Store for free (with a pro version available). It gives you information about the carrier you are connected to, including the band being used and your signal strength. It also provides data about your Wi-Fi connection. If you're on Project Fi, as I am, Signal Spy has some extra functionality. As you may know, Project Fi switches between T-Mobile/US Cellular/Sprint based on who has the best signal. Occasionally, the switching algorithm doesn't work and leaves you with a poor connection. With Signal Spy, you can easily force a connection to a specific carrier (or re-enable auto switching). InputMapper (Windows) There are a few PC games that I use a controller for, such as Grand Theft Auto V. I actually prefer Sony's DualShock 4 controller over the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers, but very few PC games natively support the DS4. That's where InputMapper comes in. InputMapper is a small free utility that allows you to use a DualShock 4 controller with any game that supports Xbox controllers. It does this by emulating an Xinput device, and all the input from the DS4 is sent to the emulated controller. There is no loss in functionality, and you can use a DS4 over Bluetooth or USB. You can even remap buttons, as seen in the above screenshot. Chrome extensions (Windows/Mac/Linux) Lastly, I wanted to include a few Chrome extensions that I have found extremely useful. Some of these are available on other browsers too. HTTPS Everywhere: This is an extension developed by the EFF that forces HTTPS on sites known to support it. Keepa: This adds a price history chart to Amazon listings. Privacy Badger: This is another extension from the EFF, which tries to block trackers online. Sometimes it can break certain sites, so if a web page won't work right for some reason, you probably need to turn this extension off. Peek: If you hover over a link to a file (or Google Doc), it will show a preview of it. It supports videos, audio files, PDFs, Office documents, and more. Full disclosure - I developed this one, but I think it's pretty darn useful. Save Image as PNG: This adds a 'Save image as PNG' item to the right-click menu. Pretty simple. Toolbox for Google Play Store: This adds a few cool features to the Play Store web site, like a button on app listings to see APKs on APKMirror. It's actually developed by Android Police! Conclusion Wow, this post was long. If you have any questions about the hardware or software in this list, feel free to ask me in the comments below.

It looks fantastic :) Corbin Davenport Gladly! http://www.ebay.com/itm/First-Order-Trooper-vinyl-decal-sticker-STAR-WARS-Force-Awakens-/171760424579 EcE Any particular reason your smartwatches stopped working? I like my Sony SW3 but it will definitely be the last one if it dies all of a sudden. Corbin Davenport The battery actually expanded on my Moto 360, and won't hold a charge at all. As for the Gear Live, I was mistaken. It still works fine, it just needs a new band. EcE That's mostly what I'm worried about, the battery. Sometimes it gets really hot for no reason. Thanks! EcE Btw, how do you like the gear live? Corbin Davenport It's still an okay smartwatch. The stock band is awful (especially the massive lug), and the screen is kinda small, but it's still perfectly usable. I think I would still recommend the original LG G Watch over it - the G Watch has a smaller profile (but doesn't have WiFi), and can be found a bit cheaper. brandon johnson Do you have wear 2.0 on your Huawei Watch? any issues with google assistant recently? Corbin Davenport I'm still using the Developer Preview on it, since I don't think the final 2.0 release has been pushed to it yet. I don't really use Assistant on it, though. Orlando aka Pixel XL I have surface pro 4 connected to dock station with two monitors. LG watch sport and pixel XL/Samsung Galaxy S8+ How is that programming application? I use pycharm and enthought canopy which r awful! Corbin Davenport You mean Sublime Text? Like I said in the post, it's great. Atom Editor and Visual Studio code are pretty close in functionality, if you don't want to/can't pay for a Sublime license. Computator Sublime text is amazing! and you can also use it indefinitely for free, it will just ask you to upgrade once in awhile. MJ We have some things in common Corbin! Own a Pixel XL myself and I also built an AMD based PC. A Dell keyboard? Come on, spring for a good mechanical keyboard... Everyone underestimates having a quality keyboard. EcE What's so great about mechanical keyboards? I've been curious lately MJ They just feel so much better to type on and I type quicker. You do need to try out the different key types yourself before buying something. kenspiracy Agreed. I do most of my writing on a budget mechanical keyboard, but lately I've been trying to type more on my Chromebook to get out of my room a bit. I was surprised at how much slower I type on the Chromebook I've actually had longer than the mechanical keyboard. Believe the hype, for sure. Mechanical is the way to go. George Agreed to this as well, they are so comfortable to type on. The most important thing is to find the correct switch that suits you. Corbin Davenport I switch between this Dell keyboard and my mechanical keyboard from time to time, I just prefer the lower key travel on the Dell one (especially for gaming). ddevito I stopped reading at "Nexus 5X was the best phone I'd ever used" lol JK nice article Deeco DS4Windows is better no? someone755 I don't know how good it is with DS4 support, but for DS3, nothing beats SCP: https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit Deeco Nice, but doesn't that lack customization? How does it perform compared with DS4Windows? thanks someone755 Like I said, I don't know how the DS4 support is as I own a DS3. I don't know what customization you'd want out of a driver. It works wirelessly, and it works well. That's about all I can tell you about it, sorry. kenspiracy I use DS4W regularly. Using 3 PS4 controllers over Bluetooth often causes some connectivity issues, but plugging in those controllers works perfectly, and using one PS4 controller over Bluetooth doesn't have any connectivity issues at all. I haven't used InputMapper, but DS4W seems like the better bet, since there really isn't any setup beyond syncing the controller over Bluetooth. Deeco Do you have any problems with UAC? Everytime I at boot, it prompts me for admin privileges on W10, which is annoying as hell. Matías Duarte Install it in AppData instead of Program Files, it's prompted the first time you open it Deeco Does it matter if my data is on one drive and os on on another? thanks psy spy Sublime Text? :-0 I am not going to read anymore of your posts! psy spy Man up and use vim. :-D Anton Voloshin Why not both? I use vim for configs and Sublime for coding when I need to edit many files at once, for Markdown, for random notes (because autosaving). Computator I use both depending on whether I am using a GUI or CLI. ghagiel Notepad++ or bust :-P jdrch I work in computer simulations, in which you can easily generate 2+GB text files for simulation inputs. Sublime Text is THE ONLY text editor that won't absolutely choke on those. Also, it seems to be the only (free) native 64-bit text editor for Windows. shadowx360 Same here. I work with massively parallel computational workloads that generate ridiculously large files that won't open in anything else that I've tried. Just turn off wordwrap on Sublime and it'll open them just fine even on my laptop. jdrch Nice to meet someone else in the industry haha. I usually get odd comments when I mention that I frequently wrangle 250K+ line text files 😂😂 Jan-Lk Else What about adding HTTPS to AP? ;) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, working on it. JasonIvers Just use Cloudflare... They provide SSL, as well as DDOS protection, etc, for free. It takes basically no work, or even much knowledge, to set it up. Then, if you want to do your own later, you can, but people will be able to use https on the mean time. Artem Russakovskii We already do use Cloudflare, including their SSL, but it's not so simple with our setup for reasons I don't want to explain. We made it work on apkmirror already, and AP is coming. Simon I also bought a used Dell Latitude laptop. They're great. But it is a different model E7440 with 1080p, i5-4310u and ssd. I got lucky because the person selling it just got an updated battery with a bigger capacity from a newer model that still fits (without sticking out of the case). 8 hour battery life in a superb construction for 400CAD Bewear Hey, I've got the same webcam! I like it, though it seemed to have some problems while recording from non-Logitech software. You've got nice and interesting hardware. I was a bit surprised by that Samsung tablet, but then I noticed you were running LineageOS on it, that's great! makapav The Android tablet market is utter garbage and it's all Google's fault: apps running in phone mode, no decent 64-128GB options, ridiculous prices, no Android updates on most wifi tablets (I thought carriers were the cause of delayed OS updates on phones?), most tablet OEMs have stripped out multi-profile mode from their tablets...it's disappointing. I need two tablets but nothing that is remotely acceptable. Andrés Jabois Question about the microphone, what's the range at which you can talk to it without sounding too low? Corbin Davenport A few inches, maybe. I definitely have to keep it close. CaptainStarCone What watchface is that? Corbin Davenport https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fatrussell.watchface.dinosaurwatchface JD Time to Ryzen up that desktop. Da Fuq Agreed, but it's gonna be pretty expensive. New CPU, MB and DDR4 RAM. JD Still cheaper than an Intel setup. Once you consider the performance gain you can't afford to not upgrade Matías Duarte DS4Windows works better for me than ImputMapper. It's already mapped and you can use the touchpad as a mouse. Pretty good for using your PC from distance. EDIT: nevermind, someone already posted this. Corbin Davenport InputMapper is already mapped too, and also lets you use the touchpad as a mouse. Peter Garlinski I like that USB dock. Do you use it charge the Pixel or any other USB C device? I'm thinking I would miss using USB C. Nice sticker by the way. I have a 'Stormtrooper' build going on my truck, but instead of a sticker, I went with a stormtrooper trailer hitch cover. Corbin Davenport Actually, I charge my Pixel with the stock charger next to my bedstand (the dock is in my closet, where I can easily hide the mess). This will work fine with USB Type-C devices if you use a Type A-to-C cable, but that won't work with USB-PD quick charging (maybe Qualcomm QC, not sure). jdrch Excellent setup. It's cool you can think for yourself instead of going for the standard Pixel XL + MBP/Chromebook like many Android blogdrones do. A few things: - Props on the desktop. Which OS do you use on it? - I swear by Sublime Text. Good call. - I didn't know LineageOS supported Galaxy Tab S models now, that's great news! I'm sick of my Shield K1's performance issues and am strongly considering dumping it for a Tab S/S2 running LOS. Corbin Davenport I use Windows 10 on all my PCs. I tried Fedora Linux a few weeks ago (I made a post about it on my personal blog: https://www.corbin.io/2017/04/trying-out-fedora-linux-part-one.html ), but booting into Windows every time I wanted to play a game wasn't really worth the hassle. jdrch More or less the same here. I run Windows 10 Release Ring on 2 Dell desktops and Slow Ring on a Vaio laptop. An ancient HP EliteBook runs Linux Mint (whatever the latest build is) just so I can keep up with what's going on in that world. Verizon Galaxy S5 running LOS 14.1 is my daily driver, and a stock unrooted (!!! it's sufficiently stock & supported well enough to make rooting and bootloader unlocking not that useful) Shield K1 is my tablet. I've always wanted to add a Mac or other BSD machine so I can say I run all 3 major desktop OSes, but so far it's been just too expensive to do (the new MBP prices haven't helped that situation,) I don't the space anyway, and administrating what I currently have is enough work as it is. I don't see the point or value of ChromeOS or Chromebooks when I can get a full blown laptop for approximately the same price. I should add: upgrade to the Logitech C922 or Brio 4K when you can. I upgraded to the latter (a couple weeks before Logitech sprang the Brio 4K release on me, I was so mad) and the picture quality upgrade is like night vs. day, not to mention the background replacement feature. Corbin Davenport I think (and I told people looking at Chromebooks when I worked at retail) that if you can get everything done in a browser, or with Android apps, Chromebooks are some of the best computers you can buy. Updates for years, no viruses/malware, speedy performance, and (mostly) cheap. Of course, the catch is having everything you need a browser. I can't, because I actively need Photoshop and a few developer tools that are non-existent on Chrome OS, but I think a lot of people can. Gen. Chang Interesting post, thanks for sharing. I'm curious though, how well the Project Fi has worked overall. Since you wanted to stick with it, I assume you get pretty good coverage and reception? But, how much data do you end up paying for? Is your bill consistently the same price each month? And have you experienced any of the Pixel backup issue's others have had? Corbin Davenport Project Fi has worked great. I'm not in a densely-populated area, so I never really deal with network congestion, and between Sprint and T-Mobile I rarely lose coverage. As far as the bill, it usually hovers between $30-40 each month for me. Not worrying about data caps and tethering restrictions is great, and syncing my calls/texts with Hangouts is icing on the cake. Regarding backups, the only thing that seems to be stuck is call history. abc Speaking of input mapper, Sony really should develop some official software to let their controllers work on PC. I don't get why they don't. It won't cost too much and will help them sell more controllers. Michael Hazell Must be nice to be able to afford expensive devices like the Pixel. I maintain my stance that there really hasn't been a successor to the OnePlus One since its inception because no future model has come to its price point.

Photo / AP The NBA playoffs are currently in full swing, with the best basketballers in the world battling in the first round. Well, most of the best basketballers in the world. The (self-proclaimed) best player in the world is, like the rest of us, watching on from the sidelines. And that's an altogether positive thing, both for the opposition, who are fortunate to avoid him, and for the rest of us, who are treated to the following. In a piece he wrote for the Players' Tribune website - rather amusingly titled "The NBA Is Lucky I'm Home Doing Damn Articles" - Miami Heat guard Dion Waiters revealed the brash man behind the brash player. It's an intriguing insight into the arrogance required to reach the top, an attribute hidden by most athletes behind a facade of faux modesty. It's hilarious throughout and heartfelt in places, and begins with a wonderful story about Waiters being underestimated his whole life. "I had just transferred over to South Philly High, and I was walking to class the first day when these two security guards came over to me," Waiters writes. "The one guard was like, 'Hey! Young boy! Hey!' They're questioning me, like, 'Hey, what're you doing here? "So I pull the basketball roster out of my pocket, and I say, 'I'm Dion Waiters. I just transferred.' The guard says, 'Never heard of you.' So I say, 'Man, I'm committed to [play college basketball at] Syracuse!' The other guard starts cracking up. He goes, 'Son, you're not committed to Syracuse.' "They're looking me up and down, like, Nah, you ain't sh**. So I say, 'For real! Google me!' Now they're laughing their asses off, right? The one guard goes, 'Ain't that some sh**? Google me! I am gonna Google this kid, too.' So they take me down to the office, and they Google me. "Maxpreps.com. Dion Waiters. Committed to Syracuse. The guard goes, 'Man, you weren't lying!' I'm looking at him like, uh-huh. From that day on, every time I saw that guard in the hallway, he'd yell out, 'What's up, Google Me?'" Continued below. Related Content Basketball: Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards advance in NBA playoffs Basketball: Los Angeles Clippers hold off Utah Jazz to force decider Sideswipe: April 17: Hipster lager That was an appropriate nickname, given Waiters would rise to the NBA and become something of an internet star, beloved on social media for appearing to have far more faith in his own abilities than a player of his talent has any right to possess. "I'm not a big internet guy, but I see things," he wrote. "I see what people say about me. They say, 'He never seen a shot he don't like', 'He's got irrational confidence', 'He thinks he's the best player in the NBA'. "Hell yeah I do. I have to. Picture yourself walking into a South Philly playground at 12 years old, with grown-ass men, bleachers packed with people, trying to get a run in. "You think you can survive in Philly without irrational confidence? You will never in your life hear the words, 'I can't' come out of Dion Waiters' mouth. I can. I will. I already did." A true Gift for African baseball If coming out of the mean streets of Philadelphia was hard, it's nothing compared with the journey just completed by the delightfully-named Gift Ngoepe. The Pittsburgh Pirates infielder this week became the first African-born player to appear in Major League Baseball and, in his very first at-bat, became the first African to get a hit in an MLB game. Ngoepe grew up in South Africa, a country not exactly known for its baseball pedigree, and fell in love with the sport the way many of us have all around the world: by watching the Yankees play the Red Sox. "Me and my best friend at the time, he liked the Yankees for some reason and I knew there were huge rivalries with Boston so I took the Boston team, so me and him had a little bit of a battle going on," Ngoepe told Deadspin. "Baseball would come on Sunday night and he would record it on his TV, when I guess the recording devices started coming out, so on Monday after school, we would go watch the game. "That's how we watched baseball. And then if we were trying to watch the World Series, we'd have to stay up late, especially on weekends, that's the only time we could watch." As a teenager, Ngoepe headed to Europe to attend a three-week MLB training camp, where he was discovered by the Pirates. But his journey was only just beginning, spending nine years in the lower levels of the organisation before finally reaching the big leagues.

A Scientist Reviews Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 A Tech Bro Charged Thousands For An Island Getaway That Turned Into The Hunger Games Even The World's Largest Internet Companies Get Phished, Just Like Your Grandma Libby Watson Apr 29, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  facebook google phishing whoops Share If you've ever been duped by a phishing scam, you can feel a little less stupid about it today, because you've been joined in that sad club by Google and Facebook. Image: Getty. Phishing attacks, where scammers pose as a trusted company or person via email and trick people into — for example — clicking a link, signing into a fake website, or even handing over their bank details, are a huge problem. And it works surprisingly often, particularly on older people (and senior members of Hillary Clinton's campaign staff). But it seems even the world's largest internet companies — organisations that have shaped the internet itself — are not immune from such attacks. A few weeks ago, the US Justice Department announced that it had arrested a Lithuanian man in connection with a phishing attack that scammed two unnamed US tech companies out of a total of $US100 million ($134 million). Now, an investigation by Fortune has revealed that those two companies are Facebook and Google. The scam was pretty sophisticated. Between 2013 and 2015, Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly posed as a Taiwanese parts manufacturer named Quanta — which both companies do business with — through his own company with the same name registered in Latvia. He created fake email addresses and invoices for computer supplies, convincing the companies to make transfers totalling $US100 million ($134 million), which he then wired to bank accounts around the world. Rimasauskas denies the charge. Both Facebook and Google confirmed that they had been victims of the scam. In an email to Gizmodo, a Facebook spokesperson wrote: Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation. We are confident that we have the proper controls in place to prevent such attacks in the future. The spokesperson didn't respond to our query about whether the company had implemented any new measures to stop a similar incident from happening again. Meanwhile, a Google spokesperson told Fortune, "We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved." An important twist reported by Fortune? Google and Facebook didn't disclose this event to shareholders, which may mean they ran afoul of rules requiring them to disclose "material events". Fortune's sources close to the companies "suggested they had decided the Rimasauskas fraud was not material enough to require disclosure of it". $US100 million ($134 million) over two years sounds reasonably material to us, but what do we know? Whether or not these companies misled their shareholders, one thing is sure: No one, whether it's your grandma who sent over her bank details to someone from CommonwealthBank dot yahoo dot com or one of the richest companies in the world, is safe from phishing.

It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting, in fact. Besides the intrigue of the mournful saga of Note7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8.

Why The Scariest Response To Climate Change Is Finally Being Taken Seriously Maddie Stone 28 Apr 2017 2:00 PM We aren't doing such a great job solving the whole climate change problem, which is why some experts think it's time to study more radical tactics. The notion of geoengineering -- hacking the climate to cool the planet -- is controversial, awe-inspiring and, to many, terrifying. And yet, despite their own grave concerns with the idea, a group of researchers believes the time has come to explore whether planet-hacking might really work. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

The partnership takes off with an international conference on the internet policy and governance in Africa, which will hold at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, from Tuesday May 2. With the theme: ‘Strengthening Internet Policy through Theoretically Grounded Research,’ the three-day roundtable will examine the appropriate ways Africa should participate in the internet revolution with implication for economic diversification, access to technological infrastructure and finance, content, privacy and security as well as knowledge and capacity building. In a statement signed by the Executive Vice Chairman, ISGPP, Dr. Tunji Olaopa, at the weekend, the conference, which is being jointly organised by both partners, is a multi-disciplinary research initiative aimed at providing a platform to address the research, publishing, teaching and policy development needs of Africa in the area of internet policy and governance with a view to enhancing African contributions in the global internet policy and governance discourse. The roundtable is a scholarly interdisciplinary initiative that will bring together various researchers of African descent working in Africa and the Diaspora to identify and critically interrogate core issues about internet policy and governance in Africa. The collaboratory conference will also set the tone for a Pan-African academic agenda for internet policy and governance. Over the three days, African academics and experts who understand the unique context and challenges of internet governance in Africa, spend quality time exploring and highlighting specific sub-regional issues from a broad-based conceptual approach. Topics to be discussed during the round table include economic diversification (innovation, entrepreneurship and start-ups) with focus on disruptive and emerging technologies; access (infrastructure and finance); content (intellectual property/piracy intermediaries and copyright); privacy and security (safety and rights) as well as knowledge and capacity building. The conference will present the results of the three-day discussions for implementation and concrete actions. According to Olaopa, one of the envisaged outcomes of the collaboration is that it will ultimately give birth to a Pan-African think tank on internet policy and also serves as a platform for expanding frontiers in academic research and in advancing digital industrialization by Africans for Africans. The Pan- African think tank on internet fits in with the broader objectives of the ISGPP. Practically, the international conference is expected to seek answer to several questions including the overall state of the internet policy and its governance in Africa, the key drivers of economic diversification in the internet economy and the critical issues hindering digital innovation, entrepreneurship and start-ups on the continent. Others are examining the digital trends, internet of things and machine learning shaping African economies, how Africans will use internet to diversify their economies, the major challenges to accessing finance to drive digital infrastructure for universal access as well as the best practices on the continent for facilitating innovation ecosystems. The roundtable will also examine the level and nature of the progress which the continent is making about digital education, the strategic knowledge and capacity gaps in internet policy that need to be addressed and how they should be tackled, issues of cyber and physical security as well as the intersection between innovation, copyright, entrepreneurial and technological areas, among others. The ISGPP is a fast growing research-driven organisation, with a think tank known as the Public Policy Group (PPG) at the core of its operations. The PPG is dedicated to research and consultancy in support of governance and policy work in Nigeria and the rest of Africa. The school’s research activities are widespread covering all sectors: economy, governance, socio-cultural development, natural resources, national security and defence, education, science and technology, climate, environment and sustainable development and international affairs. Also, as an organisation with global outlook, ISGPP provides to its partners and stakeholders nationally and globally an innovative platform for collaborative engagements on issues of governance, democracy and development.   Previous articleFormer FCT Minister Declares Governorship Ambition in Bauchi Next articleBiafra: Igbo Think-Tank Lauds Kanu’s Release, Demands for Justice Online Editor RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Breaking Jonathan: The Whole Truth About 2015 Poll Yet To Be Told Breaking Obasanjo Narrates How Ribadu’s Threat to Arrest Tafa Balogun in Aso Rock Led to Ex-IG’s Sack Breaking FG Considers Further  Review of Petrol Pricing Template 989,438FansLike 746,850FollowersFollow Latest News Jonathan: The Whole Truth About 2015 Poll Yet To Be Told April 30, 2017 Obasanjo Narrates How Ribadu’s Threat to Arrest Tafa Balogun in Aso...

Make your money work for you Common sense and some discipline are all you need. Published Apr 25, 2017.   Shutterstock Apr 25, 2017.   Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Dreaming of writing that book or taking that cruise when you hit your 40s? Well, this dream need not be unrealistic. All it takes is simple math and the foresight to do some smart financial planning when you are still young. If you start early and get into the discipline of cutting down on unnecessary expenditure, using that money to invest systematically, you can build wealth that sets you free to tick those items off your bucket list sooner than later. A quick look at how much you spend on indulgences will give you an idea of how much you can save and invest. For example, if you spend, say Rs. 1,000 on movie watching per week, this amount compounded over 10 years means you would have spent around Rs 7,52,000 on just movies! You can try this calculation for yourself. Think of any weekly or monthly expense you regularly make. Now use this calculator to understand how much these expenses will pile up overtime with the current rate of inflation. Now imagine how this money could have grown at the end of 10 years and overcome the inflation effect if you had instead invested a part of it somewhere! It is no rocket science The fact is that financial planning is simpler than we imagine it to be. Some simple common sense and a clear prioritization of life’s goals is all you need: Set goals and work backwards: Everything starts with what you want. So, what are your goals? Are they short-term (like buying a car), medium-term (buying a house) or long-term (comfortable living post-retirement). Most of us have goals that come under all the three categories. So, our financial plans should reflect that. Buying a house, for example, would mean saving up enough money for up-front payment and ensuring you have a regular source of income for EMI payment for a period of at least 15-20 years. Buying a car on the other hand might just involve having a steady stream of income to pay off the car loan. Save first, spend later: Many of us make the mistake of putting what is left, after all our expenses have been met, in the savings kitty. But the reverse will have more benefits in the long run. This means, putting aside a little savings, right at the beginning of the month in the investment option that works best for you. You can then use the balance to spend on your expenditures. This discipline ensures that come what may, you remain on track with your saving goals. Don’t flaunt money, but use it to create more: When you are young and get your first job, it is tempting to spend on a great lifestyle. But as we’ve discussed, even the small indulgences add up to a serious amount of cash over time. Instead, by regulating indulgences now and investing the rest of your money, you can actually become wealthy instead of just seeming to be so. Set aside emergency funds: When an emergency arises, like sudden hospitalisation or an accident, quick access to money is needed. This means keeping aside some of your money in liquid assets (accessible whenever you want it). It thus makes sense to regularly save a little towards creating this emergency fund in an investment that can be easily liquidated. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket: This is something any investment adviser will tell you, simply because different investment options come with different benefits and risks and suit different investment horizons. By investing in a variety of instruments or options, you can hedge against possible risks and also meet different goals. How and Why Mutual Funds work A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment scheme that pools money collected from investors like you and invests this into a diversified portfolio (an optimal mix) of stocks, bonds and other securities. As an investor, you buy ‘units’, under a mutual fund scheme. The value of these units (Net Asset Value) fluctuates depending on the market value of the mutual fund’s investments. So, the units can be bought or redeemed as per your needs and based on the value. As mentioned, the fund is managed by professionals who follow the market closely to make calls on where to invest money. This makes these funds a great option for someone who isn’t financially very savvy but is interested in saving up for the future. So how is a mutual fund going to help to meet your savings goals? Here’s a quick Q&A helps you understand just that: How do mutual funds meet my investment needs? Mutual Funds come with a variety of schemes that suit different goals depending on whether they are short-term, medium-term or long-term. Can I withdraw money whenever I want to? There are several mutual funds that offer liquidity – quick and easy access to your money when you want it. For example, there are liquid mutual funds which do not have any lock in period and you can invest your surplus money even for one day. Based on your goals, you can divide your money between funds with longer term or shorter term benefits. Does it help save on taxes? Investing in certain types of mutual funds also offers you tax benefits. More specifically, investing in Equity Linked Saving Schemes, which are funds that invest in a diverse portfolio of equities, offers you tax deductions up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Don’t I need a lot of money to invest in MFs? No, you can start small. The returns in terms of percentage is the same irrespective of the amount you invest in. Additionally, the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) allows you to invest a small amount weekly, monthly or quarterly in a mutual fund. So, you get to control the size and frequency of your investment and make sure you save before you spend. But aren’t MFs risky? Well many things in life are risky! Mutual funds try to mitigate your risk by investing your money across a variety of securities. You can further hedge risk by investing in 2 to 3 mutual offers that offer different growth stories i.e. a blue-chip fund and a mid-cap fund. Also remember in a mutual fund, your money is being managed by professionals who are constantly following the market. Don’t I have to wait too long to get back my returns? No! Mutual Funds, because of the variety of options they offer, can give you gains in the short or medium term too. The essence of mutual funds is that your money is not lying idle, but is dynamically invested and working for you. To know more about how investing in mutual funds really works for you, see here.

Make your money work for you Common sense and some discipline are all you need. Published Apr 25, 2017.   Shutterstock Apr 25, 2017.   Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Dreaming of writing that book or taking that cruise when you hit your 40s? Well, this dream need not be unrealistic. All it takes is simple math and the foresight to do some smart financial planning when you are still young. If you start early and get into the discipline of cutting down on unnecessary expenditure, using that money to invest systematically, you can build wealth that sets you free to tick those items off your bucket list sooner than later. A quick look at how much you spend on indulgences will give you an idea of how much you can save and invest. For example, if you spend, say Rs. 1,000 on movie watching per week, this amount compounded over 10 years means you would have spent around Rs 7,52,000 on just movies! You can try this calculation for yourself. Think of any weekly or monthly expense you regularly make. Now use this calculator to understand how much these expenses will pile up overtime with the current rate of inflation. Now imagine how this money could have grown at the end of 10 years and overcome the inflation effect if you had instead invested a part of it somewhere! It is no rocket science The fact is that financial planning is simpler than we imagine it to be. Some simple common sense and a clear prioritization of life’s goals is all you need: Set goals and work backwards: Everything starts with what you want. So, what are your goals? Are they short-term (like buying a car), medium-term (buying a house) or long-term (comfortable living post-retirement). Most of us have goals that come under all the three categories. So, our financial plans should reflect that. Buying a house, for example, would mean saving up enough money for up-front payment and ensuring you have a regular source of income for EMI payment for a period of at least 15-20 years. Buying a car on the other hand might just involve having a steady stream of income to pay off the car loan. Save first, spend later: Many of us make the mistake of putting what is left, after all our expenses have been met, in the savings kitty. But the reverse will have more benefits in the long run. This means, putting aside a little savings, right at the beginning of the month in the investment option that works best for you. You can then use the balance to spend on your expenditures. This discipline ensures that come what may, you remain on track with your saving goals. Don’t flaunt money, but use it to create more: When you are young and get your first job, it is tempting to spend on a great lifestyle. But as we’ve discussed, even the small indulgences add up to a serious amount of cash over time. Instead, by regulating indulgences now and investing the rest of your money, you can actually become wealthy instead of just seeming to be so. Set aside emergency funds: When an emergency arises, like sudden hospitalisation or an accident, quick access to money is needed. This means keeping aside some of your money in liquid assets (accessible whenever you want it). It thus makes sense to regularly save a little towards creating this emergency fund in an investment that can be easily liquidated. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket: This is something any investment adviser will tell you, simply because different investment options come with different benefits and risks and suit different investment horizons. By investing in a variety of instruments or options, you can hedge against possible risks and also meet different goals. How and Why Mutual Funds work A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment scheme that pools money collected from investors like you and invests this into a diversified portfolio (an optimal mix) of stocks, bonds and other securities. As an investor, you buy ‘units’, under a mutual fund scheme. The value of these units (Net Asset Value) fluctuates depending on the market value of the mutual fund’s investments. So, the units can be bought or redeemed as per your needs and based on the value. As mentioned, the fund is managed by professionals who follow the market closely to make calls on where to invest money. This makes these funds a great option for someone who isn’t financially very savvy but is interested in saving up for the future. So how is a mutual fund going to help to meet your savings goals? Here’s a quick Q&A helps you understand just that: How do mutual funds meet my investment needs? Mutual Funds come with a variety of schemes that suit different goals depending on whether they are short-term, medium-term or long-term. Can I withdraw money whenever I want to? There are several mutual funds that offer liquidity – quick and easy access to your money when you want it. For example, there are liquid mutual funds which do not have any lock in period and you can invest your surplus money even for one day. Based on your goals, you can divide your money between funds with longer term or shorter term benefits. Does it help save on taxes? Investing in certain types of mutual funds also offers you tax benefits. More specifically, investing in Equity Linked Saving Schemes, which are funds that invest in a diverse portfolio of equities, offers you tax deductions up to Rs. 1.5 lakhs under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Don’t I need a lot of money to invest in MFs? No, you can start small. The returns in terms of percentage is the same irrespective of the amount you invest in. Additionally, the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) allows you to invest a small amount weekly, monthly or quarterly in a mutual fund. So, you get to control the size and frequency of your investment and make sure you save before you spend. But aren’t MFs risky? Well many things in life are risky! Mutual funds try to mitigate your risk by investing your money across a variety of securities. You can further hedge risk by investing in 2 to 3 mutual offers that offer different growth stories i.e. a blue-chip fund and a mid-cap fund. Also remember in a mutual fund, your money is being managed by professionals who are constantly following the market. Don’t I have to wait too long to get back my returns? No! Mutual Funds, because of the variety of options they offer, can give you gains in the short or medium term too. The essence of mutual funds is that your money is not lying idle, but is dynamically invested and working for you. To know more about how investing in mutual funds really works for you, see here.

Street29 Apr 2017Newport Beach, CA0 29 Apr, 2017 29 Apr, 2017 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Fortune Magazine just identified Google and Facebook as the two sophisticated U.S.-based tech companies whose employees were swindled out of $100 million by a Lithuanian hacker in the last three years. The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Lithuanian Evaldas Rimašaukas. The cyber-crime was described as a fraudulent business email compromise scheme that tricked two sophisticated U.S.-based internet companies to wire over $100 million to Rimašaukas’ bank accounts in Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Hong Kong. Although the U.S. Justice Department initially screened the names of the scammed U.S. companies, Fortune on April 27 identified what prosecutors had referred to in the federal indictment as Victim 1, as Google, and Victim 2, as Facebook. Rimašaukas beginning in 2013, “forged email addresses, invoices, and corporate stamps in a scam to impersonate a large Asian-based manufacturer with whom the tech firms regularly did business.” The Endgaget blog identified Taiwanese parts supplier Rimašaukas impersonated as Quanta Computer. The company is a huge supplier to numerous tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. The Department of Justice describes Business Email Compromise (BEC) as a sophisticated scam that targets business deals with foreign suppliers and regularly issues electronic wire transfer payments. The scheme usually seeks to compromise access to legitimate supplier business e-mail accounts through social engineering or cyber-hacking techniques. The fraudsters then request the victims to make unauthorized electronic fund transfers by disguising their activities to appear consistent with normal business practices. The FBI collaborated with Google, Facebook, their banks, the Prosecutor General’s Office, and other law enforcement agencies in the Republic of Lithuania to trace the footprints of Rimašaukas’ phishing attacks and make the arrest at his home in Vilnius. Rimašaukas was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit for identity theft, money laundering, and wire fraud. Federal sentencing guidelines state that conviction for such offenses carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 24 years. Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim, said in a Justice Department announcement, “This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies – even the most sophisticated – that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cyber criminals.” Rimasauskas, facing extradition from Lithuania, denied the allegations. Rimašaukas claims that he is innocent and intends to fight extradition to the United States. His attorney at the Cobalt firm, Linas Kuprusevicius, told Fortune in an email: “Mr. Rimasauskas cannot expect a fair and impartial trial in the U.S.A.” Read More Stories About: Breitbart California, Tech, cyber crime, Evaldas Rimašaukas, facebook, Google, nited States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Office of Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit, phising, Quanta Computer, U.S. Justice Department Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

But the danger is that as a rhetorical question, it is assuming a lot. Of course, everyone, at a superficial level, knows that the Internet is a dynamic technological innovation that has become very significant to the ways we imagine our contemporary world today. The Internet makes a lot of things possible. For instance, at the entrepreneurial level, the Internet is critical to the networking of business ideas in a manner that is not limited by space and time. My business proposal, for instance, can be forwarded to a collaborator in Germany who in turn can ask for its assessment in Switzerland, and funding for the proposal can be sought in the United States, all without any of us having any physical contact. The Internet has therefore become an electronic communication highway that generates interdependence while providing transformational possibilities. There is no doubt that the development of the Internet has transformed humanity’s potentials to overcome its limitations. But however significant this understanding is, it is still superficial as to the full extent of the possibilities that the Internet possesses, especially for development purposes at a continental level like Africa and its many underdeveloped states. At a distinctly significant Roundtable coming up between May 2-4, 2017, a critical segment of the African academic community as well as a critical mass of Internet practitioners will be converging at Ibadan, under a collaborative effort between Google and the Ibadan School of Government and Public Policy (ISGPP), to deliberate on the crucial relationship between governance, Internet research and Internet policy to Africa’s development efforts in the twenty first century. At least, one objective is to initiate a discourse that goes beyond a surface appreciation of the potentialities of the Internet to exploring the deeper capacities it possesses for transforming Africa into a strong developmental continent with formidable and thriving digital economies. The starting point of this conference is to tease out how the Internet and the lack of an effective Internet policy complicate Africa’s development vision and efforts. The theme of the Roundtable itself foregrounds a compelling development narrative: “Strenghtening Internet Policy through Theoretically Grounded Research.” Africa’s development impasse is a protracted complexity that has so many hierarchies of difficulties. One of the most fundamental is the inability of the continent to convert plausible development ideas and paradigms to transformational policy that could be the springboard for the empowerment of Africans. From the Lagos Plan of Action to NEPAD, there have been myriads of development agenda and initiatives that all failed to significantly transform Africa’s development predicament. The reigning social science concept today is the idea of a developmental state. This is the idea of a state that is able to take the burden of macroeconomic and developmental initiatives driven by its critical regulation of the crucial factors of development. Factor into this complex underdevelopment of Africa’s development potentials the lack of a functional continental Internet policy that can backstop Africa’s, and especially national, development efforts. As a former permanent secretary at the Ministry of Communication Technology, I came face to face with the implications of this critical policy absence, together with so many others. There are therefore specificities to the Internet issues that go beyond the appreciation of its significance for international, transnational and global interdependence and interaction. The fundamental issue derives from what to make of the Internet and how to deploy its relevance for national and continental development purposes. For Africa, the challenges of converting the Internet into a development dynamics are legion. Consider the following. First, there is the challenge of inclusiveness and universal service that give the Internet the capability of enfolding the whole of humanity. But the usual underdevelopment issue rears its head with the Internet in Africa. Africa has a notoriously low internet penetration rate of 16%. The continent therefore remains in a dangerous development status as large swathes of the continent remains unconnected/under-connected to the internet. 16% Internet penetration level is definitely insufficient to instigate development planning! Internet inclusiveness ties in automatically with the problem of affordability. Technology opens up efficiencies and opportunities that development policies can piggyback on to resolve the thorny challenges of, say, poverty reduction and disease control while improving quality of life and service delivery. However, since technology itself does not come cheap, those very portions of the populace who are in dire need of the Internet to access development initiatives are the very ones that will be left out of it. The 16% Internet penetration level simply means that only 15 out of every 100 Africans can access the Internet. This is even more critical when entrepreneurial creativity and SMEs are constantly being stifled by their inability to afford the cost of connection. A larger challenge comes from the lack of local content that comes from the government’s capacity to take ownership of the Internet in its own domains. This challenge is a step higher than that of inclusiveness. If the problem of inclusiveness is overcome, then there comes that of owning the contents of the Internet and deploying them for development purposes. The evolving digital economy is a prime option for Africa to creatively utilize. On the contrary, however, most of the local content available on African networks are borrowed with very little customization for the African environment. This dismal situation sends a dangerous signal of an impending digital colonization of the African Internet presence. A corollary challenge arises from the specter of cybercrimes and security issues. Ownership of Internet content automatically raises the gravity of a state’s capacity to protect those contents. The digital economy dynamics is the most prone to cybercrime which has itself become as sophisticated as the evolving technologies that created the worldwide web. If the Pentagon and other critically guided organizations can be successfully hacked, what do we say about the Internet status of critical African institutions and economies that are still at the hesitant stage of incorporation? All these challenges outlined above only presage a really deeper one. And this is the absence of a sufficiently dynamic Internet policy grounded on a compelling theoretical research that would not only match the evolving research framework that gave birth to the Internet itself, but also incorporate an African technological component into the framework of the Internet. This is really the critical issue at stake. While African countries have been rather long on rhetoric, especially about the significance of a STEM education as well as science, technology and innovation (STI) for national development, they have been too short on practical implementation of significantly concrete policies that will translate their political rhetoric to cogent policy frameworks. It is still not clear whether, for instance, African countries have made any serious progress towards meeting the target of dedicating 1% of their total GDP to research and development (R&D). There are even no available data to track development progress! Thus, for Africa to become truly developmental, it is not sufficient for the continent to just pursue getting an enlarged presence on the Internet. Rather, it must be willing to craft an Internet policy dynamics that will facilitate significant contributions in terms of an efficient Internet R&D. The Google-ISGPP Internet Policy Conference therefore becomes very timely and imperative because it brings to the Roundtable a multidisciplinary team of academics, practitioners and scholars to brainstorm on these outlined challenges as well as issues of governance and development, knowledge and capacity building, entrepreneurship and innovation, intellectual property and security, etc. The ultimate objective of the Roundtable is to jumpstart a critical development trajectory that will give birth to a Pan-African Think Tank on Internet Policy which will serve as a dynamic platform for inspiring new frontiers in academic research that will then critically advance digital industrialization by Africans for Africans. Recently, African leaders and scholars have come under the grips of the “Africa Rising” euphoria backed by some impressive economic growth data of about 7%. A further opportunity to boost a truly rising African development profile comes from the capacity of African states to boost the potential for efficient digital economies at the critical juncture of digital innovation and technologies, digital accessibility, governance foresight, and wealth generation. However, what kind of philosophy of innovation in Africa can bring about thriving digital economies? To answer this question means beginning with a glaring absence of such a developmental philosophy as a crucial antecedent to a formidable developmental state in Africa. The top ten states in Africa with very high Internet penetration are Nigeria (48.4 users), Egypt (29.8m), Morocco (16.5m), Kenya (12m), South Africa (8.5m), Sudan (6.5m), Tanzania (5.6m), Algeria (5.2m), Uganda (4.4m), and Tunisia (4.2m). In spite of this high penetration, these countries have still not become outstanding examples of digital economies or of a developmental state. At the minimum, therefore, the Google-ISGPP Roundtable will attempt to lay the foundation of an academic reflection on Internet policy and development initiatives that will (a) seek to connect emerging disruptive technologies to the efficiency of digital infrastructure on the continent; (b) generate the gem of research thinking on the idea of innovative ecosystem and economic diversification in the unfolding Internet and knowledge economy; and (c) map the relationship between the dynamics of the Internet and other digital trends to the awakening of the entrepreneurial creativity in Africa. All these derive from the will to go forward in the drive to establish an Internet Policy that will link both research and development efforts across the continent. Thus, this African academic collaboration will become a significant groundwork to establish the fundamental theoretical foundation that could identify the core issues required to nurture an African contribution to the dynamics of Internet policy across the globe. The Roundtable, at the end of its proceedings, will achieve two significant things. First, it will become the nucleus of an African academic community of practice on the Internet and Internet policy. This community will then be broadened and strengthened over time into a large theoretical space that will mainly define the African best practices in internet innovation and digital governance economy. This community of practice, through working papers, research themes, conferences and seminars, publication and social media marketing, etc., would be expected to continually define the relationship between digital infrastructure and governance in Africa. Second, as an immediate benefit, the Roundtable will produce an action plan—The Academic Action Plan on Internet Policy in Africa (AAPIPA)—together with a template for its dissemination and implementation across the continent. The Google-ISGPP Roundtable has only three days to unravel, but its impact is expected to become the seed for transforming reflection and policy research on the utility of the Internet and digital infrastructures in Africa.

A phone leaker, Evan Blass, last week, put on Twitter that the most awaited version of Android Wear will at last come. The second version of the watch, according to cnet.com report, looks to completely revamp the operating system and help make watches less reliant on phones. Aside from that, the next version will add an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. As if it isn’t cool enough, the firm will also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google’s intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel smartphone. The report noted that earlier, it was already confirmed that not all Android watches will get the updated version. The original Moto 360 and LG G Watch won’t be upgraded to Android Watch 2.0.

Given the lack of Android Wear 2.0 watches currently available in Canada, LG’s Watch Style is an appealing option north of the U.S. border, despite its somewhat lacklustre initial reviews. If you’re interested in picking up the LG Watch Style, you can find it on the Google Play Store. The watch is available in Silver, Rose Gold (for an extra $40) and Titanium. It’s still unclear when Google and LG plans to bring the the LG Watch Sport to Canada, though with the Style finally becoming available here, it’s likely to follow soon.

In the first three months of the year, Alphabet garnered a net profit of $5.43 billion, from a revenue of $24.7 billion until the end of March. About $21.41 billion of the revenue came from advertising, while $3.1 billion was derived from other sources of income and the other $244 million stemmed from bets, as Alphabet calls sub-companies and projects that the tech cooperate has in place to diversify its sources of income. The company also added that its operating income amounted to $6,568 million, projecting a 27 percent increase from last year, and the earnings per share were $7.73. The company also revealed that the number of clicks on ads, one of Alphabets top income sources, was up by 44 percent. Ruth Porat, Alphabets CFO, said that Our excellent results represent a terrific start to 2017, with revenues up 22 percent versus the first quarter of 2016 and 24 percent on a constant currency basis. We clearly continue to benefit from our ongoing investments in product innovation and have great momentum in our new businesses across Alphabet, she added. During a conference call with analysts and media, Porat also revealed that Alphabet was exploring many options to commercialize its autonomous car technology, a project which is under the supervision of Waymo, Alphabets automobile development unit, in collaboration with Fiat Chrysler (FCA). Waymo also announced that he will initiate a program in Phoenix, Arizona, where some inhabitants of the city will be able to use the autonomous Pacifica car.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

Then this may be the answer to your prayers: Google has teamed up with Huawei to deliver the HiKey 960, a Raspberry Pi style computer board that runs Android. Developed with teams at Google, ARM, Huawei, Archermind, and LeMaker, it was made primarily so that Android developers could code on a device using an ARM based chip like so many of the devices that run Android apps, rather than on Intel x86 chips. But while it's based primarily at developers, there's nothing stopping anyone running it as a straight Android computer. Top specs It's a powerful board too, in line with the top-end performance of Android's big smartphone hitters. The HiKey 960 has a Huawei Kirin 960 octa-core chip, which makes use of four high-performance ARM Cortex-A73 and four efficient Cortex-A53 cores. That's the same as you'd find in the Huawei Mate 9. 32GB of storage is onboard along with 3GB of RAM. Frustratingly however, though the board's Mali G71 GPU can deliver 4K visuals, the board's HDMI 1.2a slot will limit it to 1080p output. Elsewhere, the board offers 802.11 b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1, with PCIe m.2 slots for expanding storage and connectivity options, and 40-pin and 60-pin connectors for monitors and cameras. Getting Android 7.1 working on the board won't be as simple as "plug-in-and-play" however – you'll need to work on your command line know-how and follow instructions laid out by Google. But as a learning project it should be fascinating.  Launching in May, it's priced at $239, which converts roughly to £185 or AU$320. 10 best computers of 2017: the best PCs ranked Related news E3 2017: Everything you need to know about this year's gaming extravaganza Surprise surprise, Nintendo won’t be hosting a press conference at E3 2017 The best PC games of 2017… so far Best free Android apps of 2017: 100 you must download See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Pichai received a salary of $650,000 (Rs 4.36 crore approx) last year, slightly less than $652,500 (Rs 4.18 crore approx) he earned in 2015 in dollar terms (but in rupee terms it is slightly higher due to currency variation). But the long-time Google employee, who was named CEO during the company’s reorganisation in August 2015, received a stock award of $198.7 million (Rs 1,332.96 crore approx) in 2016, roughly double his 2015 stock award of $99.8 million (Rs 639.03 crore approx). The company’s compensation committee attributed the lavish pay to Pichai’s promotion to CEO and “numerous successful product launches”, the CNN reported. Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and previous CEO, shifted his focus to growing new businesses under the Alphabet umbrella. Under Pichai, Google has boosted sales from its core advertising and YouTube business, while also investing in machine learning, hardware and cloud computing, the report said. In 2016, Google unveiled new smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a router, and a voice-controlled smart speaker. These efforts have started to pay off for the company.

Google posted more of the 2017 I/O schedule, time to plan your own Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 3:24pm PDTApr 28, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 111 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares180 Android OS Development Google News More of this year's schedule for Google's I/O developer conference is finally up. At least, more than the last time we talked about it. Not all of the events are on it, as some would likely give away announcements made during the keynote at I/O by their presence on the calendar, but it looks like most of the talks should be there now. If you are planning on attending, as some of us are, then you might want to start figuring out how best to divide up your time. Some of the time slots have 12 different events, so the odds are very likely that you won't be able to make every single talk you want. Things kick off May 17th with a breakfast before the Keynote at 10 AM. The developer keynote follows that at 1 PM after a break for lunch, though there are some talks available during lunch if the subjects appeal to you, or the food doesn't. For the rest of that day and the other two, though, you're on your own to find out what you'd like to attend. Remember that some of the talks will require that you reserve a seat. The schedule will continue to be updated as we get closer to the event. Those of us who may not be there should still take a look, as Google also streams some of the other events and sessions at I/O. That means even if you weren't able to make it to the event, you can still get your developer thing on. The talks that will be streamed are marked on the schedule with a little camera icon, still leaving you with entirely too many choices. If you end up with a scheduling conflict you can always go back and watch some of the old recordings. With that, you might want to prioritize to attend things that aren't being recorded, like the "Office Hours," if you have any unwanted overlap. Another option for those that can't attend are the I/O Extended events. Feel free to check and see if any are being hosted near you. I'll probably be attending the show this way, myself. The official I/O app hasn't been updated for 2017 yet, but feel free to pull it down in anticipation via the attractive widget below, or over at APKMirror. Google has a pretty nice set of tools put together, both in the app and online, for managing your I/O schedule. With the wide selection of talks and events, it's a really good idea to use them. For the full details, to plan your schedule, or to just lament not going, feel free to check out the source link below. Download QR-Code Google I/O 2016 Developer: Google Inc.

Photo from Google) The firm has started to roll this out last week, just look up a business and tap on the arrow to get more information. The search engine will give users a live analysis on how busy the business is and what users are up against if he goes there. The latest enhancement, according to a cnet.com report, will determine how crowded an area is within an hour’s time based on aggregated, anonymized location history data. “It can also help users manage their time by providing live crowd numbers for specific businesses,” the report said noting that one could check the stores around it to see where he can go to kill time until the crowd dies down. For restaurants, it added that it will give you a hint of how long one might have to wait for a table well before reaching the door.  Facebook Comments Website Comments clash of clan hack December 28th, 2016 Reply I always spent my half an hour to read this web site’s articles every day along with a mug of coffee. love anal March 5th, 2017 Reply jaJiDQ Your means of describing the whole thing in this post is really good, all be able to easily understand it, Thanks a lot. venue finder March 6th, 2017 Reply Hey, thanks for the blog post.Really looking forward to read more.

Inside OzHarvest Market: The Grocery Store Where You Set Your Own Price Everything Coming To Netflix, Stan, Amazon And Foxtel This May Your Favourite Music App Has Higher Quality Audio Than You Think David Nield Apr 30, 2017, 6:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple music deezer google play music music spotify streaming music tidal Share Chances are you've signed up to at least one streaming service — but are you making the most of the best-quality music on offer? A quick audit of your apps can boost both streaming and downloaded bit-rates, so you're always assured of the highest fidelity audio flowing through your pricy headphones to your eardrums. Which means you hear more of the music and a little less of the noise that can accompany lower quality music files. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Just about every streaming music service out there now enables you to set music quality through the associated apps, though there may be some restrictions if you're not a paying customer. Bear in mind that higher-quality music means more data, so double-check your carrier plan if you're streaming on the go, or cache your favourite playlists over Wi-Fi before you leave the house. Spotify Image: Screenshot As far as the options available in the mobile apps go, Spotify says "Normal" is equivalent to approximately 96kbps, "High" to 160kbps, and "Extreme" to 320kbps. Alternatively you can select the "Automatic" option and have Spotify decide for you based on the strength of your network connection. Once you've decided how high the fidelity of your music should be, go inside Spotify's mobile apps, tap Your Library, then the settings cog icon — on iOS you need to tap Streaming Quality as well, and on Android the option is on the first screen under Music Quality. On the desktop clients, tap the downward arrow near your account name (top right), then Settings, then toggle High quality streaming to On. Google Play Music Image: Screenshot There's no desktop client to worry about for Google Play Music and no quality setting in the web player either, but these options have just been added to the mobile apps. Tap the menu button (top left), then Settings, then either Quality on mobile network, Quality on Wi-Fi network, or Download quality. Three or four options are available in each case, but Google hasn't revealed what bitrate these settings correspond to, and is pretty cagey about revealing the supported bitrates across its service as a whole (although it does appear to match Spotify's 320kbps). Apple Music Image: Screenshot If you've signed up for the Apple Music streaming service, then there's one toggle switch for enabling high-quality streaming over cellular networks, but no such option for downloads, which presumably are always high quality. From iOS Settings, tap Music then Mobile Data; from the Apple Music app on Android, tap the menu button (top left), then Settings, then look under Playback. You won't find any quality adjustment settings in iTunes for macOS or Windows, but Apple has confirmed its tracks stream at 256kbps AAC (a lower bitrate than Spotify, but a less lossy codec). Deezer Image: Screenshot In Deezer's mobile apps, to adjust streaming and download quality over cellular networks and Wi-Fi, tap My Music, then Settings, Audio settings and Custom (or choose one of the preset configurations). The same options can be found in the clients for Windows and macOS (go to Settings then Audio settings). Deezer doesn't give exact details of what the "Basic", "Normal", and "High Quality (HQ)" settings refer to, but presumably that HQ option matches up with the top tier 320kpbs quality. You can go higher too, but you need to shell out for a Sonos system and Deezer Elite. Tidal Image: Tidal Tidal's headline feature is the 1411kbps FLAC top-end streaming quality it offers, but you don't have to go all the way up to this if you're looking to save on some data charges or cut back on bandwidth use. On both the desktop clients and the mobile apps, you can adjust the sound quality for streaming music and downloaded tracks via the Settings option on the menu — look under the Streaming heading. On mobile there's also the option to have Tidal adjust the music quality based on your connection speed. Originally published on Gizmodo Australia.

Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started. And now, you can ask things such as ‘What’s my confirmation number for my London flight,’ ‘Take me to Museu Picasso,’ ‘Do I need an umbrella today,’ and many more. According to its blog, there is no need to download the update because Google Assistant will be usable on phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it. It came to Android Wear 2.0 – via new smartwatches – just a few weeks ago and, as we previewed in January, the Assistant is also coming to TVs and cars,” Hafsteinsson said.   Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply ab5Pn3 My brother suggested I might like this website.

Google’s famous “don’t be evil” slogan was quoted in its 2004 IPO filing; it was quietly retired in 2015 and replaced by the directive that employees should “do the right thing.” Apple told people to “think different.” Uber proudly declares that it is “evolving the way the world moves.” Tesla wants to “accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.” And so on. But behind these progressive mantras lies a more complicated reality — one that, particularly for women, has not fulfilled its promise of a better world. Just in the last few months, we’ve seen a former engineer at Uber, Susan Fowler, describe in a detailed blog post how she was sexually harassed and discriminated against at the company, and a former engineer at Tesla, AJ Vandermeyden, sue the company for its culture of “pervasive harassment.” Go back further and you’ll find allegations of sexism or overt harassment at Squarespace, GitHub, Tinder and elsewhere. And these are not isolated incidents. Last year, an industry-wide survey called Elephant in the Valley of more than 200 women in tech with at least 10 years of experience found that 60 percent of them had experienced “unwanted sexual advances.” But gender bias takes other, less obvious forms, too. Eighty-seven percent of the women surveyed reported that they’d received “demeaning comments from male colleagues.” And it starts before they even sit down at their desks. Seventy-five percent said they’d been asked about their marital status, children and/or family life in job interviews. Amit SinghalGetty Images It’s hard not to conclude that the fish rots from the head, as the old saying goes. Take what happened with former Uber SVP of engineering Amit Singhal. He’d resigned from his previous job at Google after being accused of sexual harassment by a woman who worked for him — but no one at Google bothered to tell anyone at Uber before he was hired that these allegations existed. He was eventually forced to resign when Uber found out — in part because the company had just come under fire for the sexual-harassment allegations put forth by Fowler. Tech companies certainly don’t have a monopoly on sexual harassment or on gender bias. But the hypocrisy of the industry can feel quite stunning. Google tells its employees to “do the right thing” and yet has refused to release salary data broken down by gender to the Department of Labor. If they didn’t have something to hide, why would they be so resistant to it? What’s preventing them from going the extra mile to make sure that men and women are being paid equally? The stats on women in technical jobs have been getting worse, not better. As a journalist who’s written extensively about startups and startup culture, as well as working for several startups, I’ve observed that there is confusion about what and what is not appropriate in the workplace, particularly among younger people, and a charismatic founder can go a long way in masking issues of discrimination and harassment. In my novel, “Startup,” I wanted to explore these issues of sexual harassment and hypocrisy in the tech world through the eyes of a perpetrator and show how his actions affect not just the subject of his mistreatment, but also the rest of his company. So often, especially at startups (and certainly in the fictional startup I portray in my book), human resources is an afterthought, the last department to be hired — and companies’ young, inexperienced workers are easily taken advantage of. Of course, it’s not just the young and inexperienced who get exploited — in part because in the past, there have been few consequences for this kind of behavior, whether on a company-wide or individual level. Perhaps that’s because in the tech industry as a whole, a dismal 5 percent of leadership positions are held by women. Arianna HuffingtonGetty Images The boards of most technology companies skew equally male — Alphabet (the parent company of Google) has three women out of 12 board members, Apple has two out of eight, Uber has one in seven (Uber’s lone woman is Arianna Huffington, who famously joined the board last year). You’ll hear CEOs lament that they can’t find enough qualified women to serve on their boards — and the few women who are in a position to be on boards report being hotly pursued — but for how long can they use this excuse? Well, probably a lot longer. When women do get hired by tech companies, it’s often in roles like marketing or human resources. In fact, according to a 2015 study by the American Association of University Women, the stats on women in technical jobs have been getting worse, not better. And this not only harms women, it also harms the industry as a whole. If the tech industry truly wants to change the world, it should start by looking in the mirror. Change is not going to be easy, or cheap. It’s going to require the people in charge to truly make an effort to not just hire women, but to nurture, encourage and promote them in their companies — and to pay them equally. In the meantime — although it shouldn’t be up to women to bear the burden of fighting sexism on their own — women do need to support each other in this industry. In my book, as in real life, women realize that they are more powerful when they stick together to push back against the patriarchy. Doree Shafrir is a senior culture writer at BuzzFeed News.

According to a report by cbronline.com, the AI system, which was trained using almost 5,000 hours of TV footage from the BBC, contained a total of 118,000 sentences from the videos. The key contributions include a “Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell” (WLAS), a network that learns to transcribe videos of mouth motion to characters. In an article published by arix.org, the goal of the work was to recognize phrases and sentences uttered by a talking face, with or without the audio. DeepMind stated that unlike previous works that have focused on recognizing a limited number of words or phrases, they tackle lip reading as an open-world problem – unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos. The same media report added that the AI was trained on shows which aired during the period between January 2010 and December 2015, and later tested its performance on programs between March and September of this year. The lip reader was only able to decipher less than one-quarter of the spoken words, whilst the WLAS model was able to decipher half of the spoken words. Based on the report, citing the News Scientist, Ziheng Zhou at the University of Oulu, Finland, said that it was a big step for developing fully automatic lip-reading systems. “Without the huge dataset, it’s very difficult for us to verify new technologies like deep learning,” he added. In its summary, the architecture of the WLAS model surpassed the performance of all previous work on standard lip reading benchmark datasets, and demonstrated that visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance even when audio is used.  Facebook Comments Website Comments mike tyson March 6th, 2017 Reply z1SL9Y Really appreciate you sharing this article.Thanks Again. rasen schneiden March 6th, 2017 Reply A big thank you for your blog article.Really looking forward to read more.

Along Together is a new puzzle adventure game for Daydream Matthew Sholtz View All Posts 2017/04/28 10:19am PDTApr 28, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 19 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares76 Daydream Games News Videos Slowly but surely new Google Daydream VR titles are trickling out. Along Together is the latest release on the platform. It is a puzzle adventure game where you play the role of a kid's imaginary companion. Your job is to guide them through their journey of finding a lost friend. Unlike many Daydream games, this is not a port. It was exclusively created and released for the platform. Sadly, that means all of you Gear VR owners are out of luck for now. On the plus side, Along Together will last most players 2+ hours of playtime. When you think about it, this is actually an alright amount of content when you compare it to many of the other recent VR releases on Android. I am glad to report that the gameplay offers a pretty solid experience that is highlighted by the clean and colorful graphics. You will mainly be interacting with the game's environment by way of the Daydream controller. Basically, you point your companion in the direction you want her to go while also completing hands on puzzles contained in each level. It is also worth noting that Along Together is offered at a single upfront cost. This means that there is absolutely no worry of any in-app purchases or advertisements. You can snag it on sale today for $8.99, which is 10% off the regular price. Once you have paid for the title, you own the entirety of its content. Honestly, there is little to complain about here. If I had to find something wrong, I suppose a demo would have been nice. Some of us might find the $10 cost to be a bit much to drop on an unproven release that cannot be tested without paying first. Overall, Along Together is a charming title that is exclusive to Daydream VR users. If you own the headset, this pleasant puzzle adventure game would make great use of it.

Then I thought the same thing about the lingering cough that is lasting longer than the flu itself. Perhaps I should call it “diet control” as well as cough, because when I try to eat a meal, I cough so much I choke. My doctor prescribed a strong cough medicine with codeine. That stopped the cough, but it also stopped me in my tracks. I am really susceptible to meds, and the codeine-laced cough medicine was reducing me to a catatonic stupor. True, I didn’t cough. But I couldn’t function, either. My friend Jeanne recommended what she said was “the best over-the-counter medicine” on the market. I thought I would be a lot safer just taking the over-the-counter medicine. After all, there was no codeine in it. It did stop the cough and allow me to sleep. But I had a strange, scary episode during the night when I got up to go to the bathroom. I couldn’t find my way out of the dark bathroom. The room is only the size of a walk-in closet. But I was so disoriented I had no idea where the door was. With a bathroom that small, I figured if I kept feeling the wall, I would find the door. It seemed like a really long time before I got out of there — and that was only after I banged my head against the granite sink. The next morning, I was still shaken by the night’s dizziness and disorientation. What was going on here? Then I looked at the kitchen counter and saw the prescription meds I was taking for the flu, along with the new over-the-counter cough medicine my friend recommended. I went to Dr. Google and called up the known side effects from the cough medicine. There it was — might cause dizziness and disorientation. Do not combine with other meds with the same ingredients. Did you ever notice when you try to read the directions, recommended dosage and ingredients of any over-the-counter medicine you need a magnifying glass? Even then it’s hard to read. I had better luck asking Dr. Google to list all the ingredients in the cough medicine. I learned the same thing was in the other med my doctor had ordered. At least now I knew why I experienced disorientation. I was laughing about it when I told my friend Jeanne I couldn’t find my way out of the bathroom. She wasn’t laughing because she said the same thing happened to her sister-in-law and it was no laughing matter. She said Sylvia also got disoriented during the night and couldn’t find her way out of the bathroom. Worse yet, when she tried to fold towels the next day, she forgot how. She starting thinking Alzheimer’s had hit her. Jeanne took the three prescription medications Sylvia was taking and found the cause of the disorientation. Disorientation was listed as a side effect of two of the medications Sylvia was taking. “But it’s prescription medication the doctor ordered. How can that harm me?” Sylvia asked. Like so many others, she figured if a doctor ordered it, it had to be OK for her. For several reasons, that is often not the case. In this age of specialized medicine, many of us see multiple doctors. Although each doctor asks us to list all medication we are taking, a busy doctor doesn’t always review it all before prescribing something else. My family doctor told me he has 1,500 patients. My internist has 1,400. No way they can keep track of every prescription each patient is taking, especially if a different doctor prescribed it. You know what that means? It’s up to each of us to be responsible for our health. We need to be familiar with each medicine we are taking and we need to be aware of potential side effects. I’ve learned to read up on all the side effects and possible counter-indications before I take a new drug. It’s good I did that because my internist prescribed a new medicine for me that clearly said it should not be taken with a beta-blocker. When I reminded him I was on a beta-blocker, he agreed I couldn’t take what he had intended to prescribe. That’s just one example of how doctors don’t always read the list of what we are taking. It’s truly up to each of us to do that. Today’s newspaper had a story about one widely prescribed drug that’s been known to cause uncontrollable body movements that can interfere with speech, swallowing and breathing. It may only adversely affect one in thousands. But what if you’re the one? If you’re having strange symptoms of any kind, ask yourself if it could be the drugs you are taking. The mother of one of my friends had increasingly irrational behavior. When her mother was found a block from her house with no clothes on, my friend took her for an evaluation, thinking her mother would have to be put in a nursing home. Instead, the doctor tried something by taking the mother off most of her medication. Voilà! The irrational behavior disappeared. Remember to never underestimate the side effects of prescription or over-the-counter medication. Contact Pattie Mihalik at newsgirl@comcast.net.

Chrome 62 will mark all HTTP pages with data entry fields as "Not Secure" Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 11:08am PDTApr 27, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 30 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares97 Applications Google News Google has been planning to mark all HTTP sites as non-secure in Chrome for a while now, but the company is taking baby steps to ensure users (and owners of HTTP-only sites) don't freak out. Chrome already identifies HTTP sites with password or credit card fields as "Not Secure" in the address bar, and Chrome 62 will expand that to any HTTP site with any data entry fields. As you can see in the above image, the 'Not Secure' warning will only appear on page load if you're in incognito mode. Otherwise, it will show up when you begin entering text. This will obviously affect far more pages than the current warning, including any pages with a search field. Chrome 62 will be released sometime in October 2017. If you're wondering when Android Police will switch to HTTPS, don't worry - we're nearly there. Source: Chromium Blog Tags chrome chrome 62 HTTP HTTPS not secure ssl subscribe ...

JG I think it could be helpful if Google were to float the "Not Secure" warning near the actual input boxes at least when you mouse over and/or select them. It would be a good extra reminder that you are entering text into a form that may not be protected. Especially if done on a mobile device, when the address bar containing the "not secure" warning could have been scrolled off screen by the time the input boxes appear on screen. proper Firefox does that Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I have this warning now in 58 beta. Romario Maxwell I found a Chrome flag to enable this behaviour: chrome://flags/#enable-http-form-warning 4Ui812 Google knows about insecure things 😉 A Person This will include HTTPS form actions loaded over HTTP. So even if the data submitted is secure, the page load must also be secure. This is already the case on desktop. roebling Great idea! Siddharth We trust you Team AP! On a lighter note even with a warning I would venture here just to see when the next pixel, OnePlus is getting leaked ;) MeCampbell30 I'm curious how the AP staff feels about moving to https (obviously you guys are doing it, but do you feel it's worth the effort?). I'd love to hear about it on the podcast. Simon Buckley HTTPS has benefits beyond improved privacy. Moving to HTTPS means that HTTP/2 can be used, resulting in faster page loads, better site compression during transport, multiplexing, and a bunch of developer-centric features like server push and asset prioritisation. This all means that users get a faster, better experience. From a business perspective, Google's search algorithms lend favour to encrypted sites as well. TL;DR - It's worth the effort. Jordan I don't think encryption ended up as a requirement for HTTP/2 in the standard, but it's a requirement in some implementations (because the standard isn't so rigorous). RainMotorsports It isn't a requirement but I haven't seen any implementation that doesn't require it. Romario Maxwell Is there a Chrome flag that can be set to display the "Not Secure" label for all visited HTTP pages right now? I know it's an eventuality in there road map though. Rob It literally takes seconds to implement SSL. If AP doesn't know how to do this faster than they're going here, this line: "If you're wondering when Android Police will switch to HTTPS, don't worry - we're nearly there." means they're pretty clueless. Jordan Maybe it's not that easy to implement on their CDN. You are making some very large assumptions about the site's configuration and platform. RainMotorsports Seconds? Sounds like you don't bother testing your cypher selection against your customer bases support needs. I wouldn't just copy and paste. Someone else's choice may leave a scenario unsupported or a cypher that's not needed that will one day end up being the next attack. Let's not forget we need to write scripts to proxy any outside content. Test our external services providers. In this case disqus is the obvious one. Should be good but who knows what else they rely on? abc You might have a point 5 years ago. But it's 2017. If a site doesnt have HTTPs by now, it's probably because they don't care for it. RainMotorsports Pretty sure I still have a point. Most sites that don't store customer information didn't care. Why should a blog be https? Do most of your users care if the government can see what phones you like? This change was only announced in the last couple of months. That's when sites that have no reason to care started caring. If you want to attack someone go attack the sysadmin that whine they have no right to do this to his site and that haven't been breached in years. abc "If you're wondering when Android Police will switch to HTTPS, don't worry - we're nearly there." No offense, but it's 2017. A popular site without HTTPS is unacceptable these days.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Guest This week’s top Indian tech news Jayadevan PK, FactorDaily@factordaily April 29, 2017 10:25 AM Image Credit: Victor Lauer/Shutterstock Here’s a quick wrap-up of the biggest stories from India this week. 1. Amazon chief Jeff Bezos is optimistic about the company’s prospects in India, a $16 billion e-commerce market. Amazon has already committed $5 billion to grow it’s presence in the country, and Bezos called out the performance of its India business at its earnings call last Thursday. He said that the company’s website is the most visited and fastest growing marketplace in India. While the company’s international business lost $481 million on the back of increased spending in geographies like India, Amazon is already at work to make its India business profitable at a unit level. 2. More sexual misconduct allegations emerge against Indian VC Mahesh Murthy, one as late as 2016. Less than a week after FactorDaily ran its story on sexual misconduct allegations against Murthy, a partner at venture capital firm Seedfund, dating back to 2003, several other women have come forward with accusations that he continued with inappropriate conduct until at least last year. 3. One97 Communications, which owns payments and ecommerce company Paytm is about to close $1.9 billion in funding. Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and others are likely to invest in this mammoth round, valuing the company at $9 billion, reports said. This leaves India’s ecommerce sector with three major players: Flipkart, Amazon, and Paytm. Among other things, Paytm also launched a “digital gold,” offering that will allow users to buy and sell gold on the app. 4. Google India on Tuesday announced a new set of products and features for Indian languages. Google Translate will now use Google’s new Neural Machine Translation technology to support English translation for nine widely used languages. India has 234 million Indian language users online compared to 175 million English users, so Google is betting heavily on Indian language users. 5. Bill Gates targeted comments at India in a blog post this week. He said India is winning the war on human waste and praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cleanliness mission. “Nearly three years ago, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made one of the boldest comments on public health that I have ever heard from an elected official. It’s still having a big impact today,” he wrote. Only a few days ago, The New York Times reported that the Indian government blocked foreign donors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, from donating to one of the largest nonprofit public health organizations in the country. Jayadevan PK is managing editor at Indian tech blog FactorDaily.

Amazon rose 3.1 percent to $945.50 (Dh3,469.98), while Alphabet gained 4.2 percent to $928.50 after their quarterly results beat estimates. The two stocks also boosted the S&P 500 index. Data showed gross domestic product increased at a 0.7 percent annual rate, below the 1.2 percent rise estimated by economists, as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less on inventories. The economy grew at a pace of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. The major indexes are on track to end the month in positive territory, with the Nasdaq on track to post gains for the sixth straight month as the corporate earnings season continues to impress. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 12.4 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While strong earnings have kept the market at or near record levels, persistent geopolitical tensions in North Korea and Syria have weighed on investors’ minds. President Donald Trump said in an interview on Thursday that a “major, major conflict” with North Korea was possible over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. “While we had some strong tech earnings last night, the market is taking a cautious attitude towards Trump’s comments on North Korea and other geopolitical concerns,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. At 9:39am ET (1339 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 16.76 points, or 0.08 percent, at 20,964.57 and the S&P 500 was down 0.08 points, or 0.00 percent, at 2,388.69. The Nasdaq Composite was up 13.18 points, or 0.22 percent, at 6,062.12. Five of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the energy index’s 0.46 percent rise leading the gainers. Royalty payments Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were up about 1.1 percent after the two companies reported quarterly profits above expectations. Qualcomm fell 3.6 percent to $51.25 after it said Apple decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers that are owed to the chipmaker until a legal dispute between the companies is resolved. Apple was up marginally at $143.73. Starbucks fell 2.9 percent to $59.58 after the world’s biggest coffee chain cut its full-year profit target. Intel was down 3.2 percent at $36.20 after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,464 to 1,034. On the Nasdaq, 1,308 issues fell and 873 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 26 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and 16 new lows.

Google is testing a way to make tab casting video suck a lot less, and you can try it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 1:19pm PDTApr 25, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 63 Share on Twitter Total Shares189 Chromecast Google News Google has introduced a new tweak in Chrome Dev channel for streaming full-screen video tabs to Chromecasts, significantly improving power consumption and streaming performance. Now your Chromecast can directly pull the video itself. Obviously there are lots of major and minor benefits to being able to stream any video feed to your Chromecast at higher quality. Now you can stream live feeds and videos from sources that didn't previously support Chromecast streaming, or for which the old methods resulted in a stuttery or low-quality stream. To put it simply: casting Amazon Prime (or other feeds that didn't have Chromecast support) just got better. Now we were certainly able to cast tabs before. But, the quality and performance sometimes left a bit to be desired, especially on lower-end machines. The video wasn't going straight to the Chromecast. It had to use your computer to render things locally, re-encode them, and spit them out over the network to the Chromecast. The new system trims the fat, sending supported video content bitstreams directly, mitigating the overhead and improving performance while also decreasing the processing power required by the host machine. The changes are exclusive to the developer channel release of Chrome for now, and they require that you flip a flag in chrome://flags/#media-remoting to enable the feature. I was able to get it working on an old potato laptop with Amazon Prime, Adult Swim, and a few other services that don't have native Chromecast support. Before the "Cast a tab" streaming resulted in a laggy mess that sucked my underpowered laptop's battery dry. Now things are buttery smooth on both my TV and my ancient computer. It might still suck that Amazon doesn't want users of its services to watch stuff on Chromecasts, but if you are using one anyway through the various workarounds like chrome's tab streaming, then things should be a bit smoother for you now. Binge-watching The Man in the High Castle just got a tiny bit better. Source: Google+ Tags casting chromecast dev channel streaming subscribe ...

Mysticode Is 5.1 audio supported? DarthHaro I believe so makapav Good point. Chromecast in general sucks with 5.1 sources. Benoit Bourdua I have seen a page lately saying its possible to get hd audio formats to play through Plex (but have yet to try it) so the Chromecast looks like it's able to deal with a lot. makapav I have both, Plex on PC and Nvidia SATV. Take it with a pinch of salt. Ryne Hager I do not know, actually. I know the Chromecasts should support it, but I can't verify and don't have the tools to test that 5.1 channel audio from a tab works. TechGuy22 MKV supported ? i know my shield doesn't play them through chromecast Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Probably not as it doesn't fall under the list of supported formats: https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media TechGuy22 lame 4Ui812 It's not lame , It's Google. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It might be supported from a technical standpoint as MKV is only a container for data, but the video files within would need be in a supported codec like VP8 or H.264. John Rename it to MP4. ddevito Chrome for Android needs better casting functionality. For example, I'd like the ability to cast the page(s) I'm surfing but cast it full screen on my TV (not simply casting my phone's display) Ryne Hager I'd love to see it improved on mobile, too. Alejandro What ? How can you cast a webpage on Android? I thought you could only cast the entire screen, unlike the desktop version of chrome. ddevito Yes, exactly. That's what I'd like to see get added Alejandro The last part you mentioned got me confused, sorry Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ But why not casting the whole display? There is literally no difference? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7d76a0ecedcec617e108bc3d0216a7dc189878e7921186fbafd0c1b5f50ae5f3.gif ddevito Yes there is. I don't want to see my Navi buttons, my notifications or the tray. I just want to see the content. I also want it to expand to the width of my TV. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Okay okay, maybe the Immersive Mode app could help you with this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmd.immersive SilentException I'm actually on Chrome Beta channel (v58 x64) and have that option as well. Nice tip! Although, this is the way it should have been working from the beginning :) Andy J For supported content yes, but even this method is only going to be useful for mp4 videos, pretty much everything else is still going to have to re-encoded by the computer and then streamed to the Chromecast. Bombaglad tmithc is awesome! T4rd Nice.. now I'll be able to cast Amazon Prime videos whether they like it or not. =p Ryne Hager And they won't be a stuttery mess! Richard Riker At least as long as Amazon doesn't find a way around that, to deliver them in a format Chromecast doesn't support or so... At least I wouldn't be surprised Ryne Hager I know, I'm just waiting for them to break it. Carson Saldanha When will we be able to natively cast the same thing to two different Chromecasts on Chrome? Carson Saldanha Need this for Google Slides John Doe It did not work for me on Amazon prime, I tried The Man in the High Castle and it also did not work on all Vimeo videos that I tried. I am running latest Chrome on Macbook pro. It doesn't even try with Amazon prime and on a few Vimeo videos it tries but then it ends up playing on both devices like it used to. I am not running the chrome dev channel but I was able to enable the flag in the stable version of chrome. hiram lowe I guess thats what you get for not following instructions then. John Doe It does work with a few videos in Vimeo...pay attention. Maxr1998 Great improvement, can't wait to try it out! Oh, and I'd so much binge-watch The Man in the High Castle, if I hadn't finished it already :D Great show! makapav > old potato laptop Laughed way too much at that description. Derp Can they PLEASE fix the mess that is YouTube casting. Bruce Wayne What's wrong with it? Lonerwithaboner420 It's laggy as hell and the sound is all jacked up Bruce Wayne What device are you casting to and from? Lonerwithaboner420 TV from fully updated PC Chrome. Bruce Wayne Is it a TV with Android TV or a Chromecast connected to the TV? Lonerwithaboner420 Chromecast Bruce Wayne Ah, yeah. I've heard that too. Especially on the 1st generation Chromecast. I cast to an Sony 4K TV with Android TV built in and streaming is smooth. I don't think they're ever going to fix the issue with the Chromecast. Lonerwithaboner420 I'm not what sure generation I have, got it last year, but either way that problem shouldn't exist. Thank god theyre fixing the issue in the article. Streaming live sports is painful the way it is now. David Hyman I used to care about amazon video not being on chromecast until i realized that my smart tv streams prime in 4k. its way too hard to go back :) Benoit Bourdua Great news! Should help with streaming sport events. Look forward to trying it. Dan It's cool that they are adding streaming the content directly but this doesn't mean we can cast Amazon now. The Chromecast pulls streams directly from the provider so unless they support syncing your account information which Amazon won't. It will just get blocked. As if you just tried pasting the address of a video stream in to a browser that doesn't have your cookie information. All of which something a technology writer should know... Andy J I'm not sure why you think that - the way these things tend to work these days - is that when you are logged in and you start to stream, you are provided a unique URL for your account, or you are provided the same CDN url as everyone else but with nonces and extra security added on the end so the CDN can verify it's really you. Dan The specifics of the mechanics change nothing. Amazon doesn't provide for it and Google isn't going to build circumvention into their browser. Portzblitz Been over the flag list twice. Even searched in-page! Please help; is it actually called "media remoting"? Andy J Yup I just copied it and then opened a new tab and pasted it in and it was there, there is another one underneath it to allow you to send encrypted content directly to the Chromecast too. But my (STABLE) Chrome updated to v58 yesterday, so check you are at least on v58 first. I'm just going to restart now and see if it works on stable despite the article saying it's exclusive to the dev channel. Edit - I'm back and it's working on STABLE v58. Portzblitz Thanks, cheers.

Last month it was reported that the US Department of Justice had arrested and charged Lithuanian man for a phishing scheme that had two tech companies on the hook for $100 million, and now they’ve been named. While the federal case left the two companies unnamed, it revealed that Evaldas Rimasauskas had used fraud, identify theft, and money laundering to scam the victims out of more than $100 million. He managed to pass himself off as Quanta Computer, a Taiwanese parts manufacturer and supplier, and forged everything from emails and invoices to business contracts. A new report from Fortune identified the victims as Facebook and Google, with representatives from both companies confirming to the publication that they had fallen for the scam. The DoJ originally described the companies as “a multinational technology company, specializing in internet-related services and products, with headquarters in the US,” and “a multinational corporation providing online social media and networking services.” Once Quanta, which provides parts for both Facebook and Google, as well as Apple and Amazon, admitted its name had been used in the scam, it was pretty obvious which companies were being talked about. Facebook has said that it has been “cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation,” while Google told Fortune that it had “promptly alerted the authorities” after the fraud was detected. Both companies add that they have recovered most of the funds they lost to the scam, but didn’t mention specific amounts.

Google adds the Pixels to its end-of-life support page Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/27 12:41pm PDTApr 27, 2017 94 Plus 1 on G+ 310 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares477 Android OS Google News Pixel Pixel XL Update 1: 2017/04/27 8:49pm PDT As it turns out, this is not new information. Google simply updated the table on the support page to include the end-of-life for the Pixel/XL security patches, confirming the October 2019 One of the bummers about buying electronic devices is that you know there will be a point after which the manufacturer will no longer keep the software updated. We usually hope for at least two years when talking about smartphones, though some OEMs barely even reach half that time. One of the benefits to buying Google's phones nowadays is that the company now maintains a page where you can see the end-of-life for those devices. El Goog just updated that page and the section for the Pixels — if you own either of those phones, or are still considering buying one, then this is good information to have. As expected, both the Pixel and Pixel XL will be definitely getting Android version updates up to October of 2018. And as for security, Google is committing to October of 2019 for those. At least this shows some level of transparency on Google's part, and it also means that the company is sticking to its earlier two-year version/three-year security updates promise. Update 1: 2017/04/27 8:49pm PDT As it turns out, this is not new information. Google simply updated the table on the support page to include the end-of-life for the Pixel/XL security patches, confirming the October 2019 date that we already knew.

Lovely. EcE Did you expect any different? pfmiller I didn't expect different but I always hope Google will someday realize 2 years is inadequate. Suicide_Note I think it's adequate, but different strokes for different folks. John Doe Is it adequate when you compare the Pixel to Google's main competitor...the iPhone? Timmy Turner Yes because everyone iOS update doesn't provide the same features for those on older hardware. John Doe LoL nice try sidestepping the issue at hand. Timmy Turner I'm not sidestepping anything. I use both platforms and I think the argument that Apple supports hardware with software longer is a bad one. John Doe Updating an operating system is not just for "new features", you give it a new updated UI, fix bugs, security issues, etc. I guess Microsoft updating all windows machines to Windows 10 is a bad argument for you as well? If you don't want to update then that is your choice but the fact that there is no update in the first place is just plain INADEQUATE. Timmy Turner No MS updating all it's machine is good business, obviously. I'm not saying I agree with Google's practice but I do understand it. Desktops and laptops age much better than smartphones, people keep them longer therefore there is a higher incentive for updates to roll out. Also I think the security updates should be a given, but it comes a point where you have to stop updating otherwise we wouldn't buy anything new. It's business. John Doe It's bad business. You don't see Apple updating their older devices hurting their bottom line because they know how to sell products and introduce new hardware features. Timmy Turner If you hate the way Google does business so much, then why not just drop Android and join iPhone users if you're concerned with software updates this much? Also, I do see Apple updating their older devices and screwing up quite a few. When the iPhone 6 got iOS 10 there were users complaining about sluggish the device felt there after. John Doe THAT IS JUST A FUCKEN STUPID ARGUMENT. I like Android and I want it to be better. Also, go check how many posts here on Android police of Google fucking up OTA updates...every company screws up sometimes it does not matter how old the hardware is. Timmy Turner Well first off, it was an argument. It was a question. Good answer by the way. I'm glad you feel so strongly about Android's improvement. I am well aware that Google gets it wrong, a little too often sometimes. My only point here today was that we can't expect Google to support these devices forever. 2-3 is honestly a long time, I don't expect more than that because beyond that there's probably features that will be half-baked on my dated device. The gesture would be appreciated but not something that personally needed. John Doe And I am saying if you are going to create a premium device that competes with Apple then you need to make sure it is as valuable as the iPhone. You need to make sure it is worth the premium price and it has a high resale value (which will be impossible if Google does not support the phone for longer than 3 years) You have your opinion about the issue which is you agree with what Google is doing and I have mine. I don't know who is right or wrong but what I do know is the Pixel devices are not doing so well against the iPhone and they advertised them a lot so there is something missing (probably stock LoL) and Google needs to change some policies. Timmy Turner Lol I have to agree with you there, Google definitely isn't competiting at the level I thought they would when the Pixel line was announced. Suicide_Note Why on Earth would/should Google be at all concerned with a 2 or 3 year old phone's resale value? That's absurd. John Doe If you want to have a "Premium" product then you need to be concerned about resale value. Apple flaunts the iPhone's resale value because it is a sign that people want their devices and "value" them greater than others. Luckbuckets like i said, security updates for atleast 3 years, i would call new UI is a feature, fix bugs i believe also come along with security if there are any worth fixing. Most anyone that really cares about having the latest and greatest software and actual performance updates more often that that anyways so if you want to be on 3 year old hardware and complain, thats your option. John Doe Again, look at Google's competition, Apple. If you can't offer the same value as your competition then don't charge the same amount of money. It is simple economics here. TheSpaceUnicorn Well, the important thing here is that value is subjective. I wish Google would offer software support for longer than 2 years, but it's not something that diminishes the value of their phones, imo. John Doe Yes it does. If your device is supported for a longer time then it will be more valuable than a phone that is supported for a short time LoL Simple Logic here. Go look at the value of iPhones overtime vs Android phones. Try to sell an iPhone 5, S5, Nexus 5 and see which phone kept its value overtime. TheSpaceUnicorn And what if I don't care about resale value, and plan of replacing my phone in 3 years anyway? How does not offering longer than 2 years of OS support diminish the value of the phone to me? John Doe You might not care about resale value but the market does. Not everyone is going to throw their phones in the garbage after they stop using them. WTF? TheSpaceUnicorn Who's just throwing their old phones in the garbage? John Doe Exactly, that is why people care about resale value because whether they decide to sell it, give it away, or keep it...they know that the phone still has value if they didn't they would throw it away. I don't know about you but I don't keep things that don't have a value to me. TheSpaceUnicorn I don't keep things either, but I couldn't possibly care less about resale value. I buy phones to enjoy them while have them, not to turn around and get as much as I can selling it later on. Suicide_Note I throw mine away if i don't feel like putting the forth the effort to sell it. itsjustironic Your logic is flawed and is just conjecture. Outside of tech communities, the average consumer more than likely has little knowledge of their phones supported life. Did you maybe ever think of something called branding? It's why companies pump billions to build their brand. It's why people will pay 10x more for a t-shirt slapped with the Nike logo on it as opposed to the plain tshirt that more than likely came from the same factory. Heck they can even keep a high resale value because they don't know how to depreciate properly. While people may resell it later on, I doubt most people purchase a product and the main factor in purchasing it is how much they can recoup when they sell it later. John Doe Google's brand is as valuable if not better than Apple's. People outside the tech community are not stupid they know when a new OS is launched. "While people may resell it later on, I doubt most people purchase a product and the main factor in purchasing it is how much they can recoup when they sell it later." That is not what I said. It does not matter what you bought the phone for because the market will determine the value of the product you have by its resale value which will tell you if you had a "premium" product or not. This is how you measure the value of a product not by people's opinions or a company's brand but how much is it actually worth to people, how much are people willing to buy it again? Luckbuckets simple economics, if you dont want it, dont buy it. In an ideal world our phones would update for ever but you can't expect that and atleast they are giving you fair warning before you buy. John Doe Actually most of these devices were not given an exact date when they were released. Also, if Google's stance is "If you don't want it, don't buy it" then they have much bigger issues than software updates. MicroNix Agreed but really. The hardware now is matured enough that it can last far past 2 years. Whoever thought 2 years was acceptable for a $700 PC? No one. So why treat your $700 phone any different? I squarely blame the carriers who started conditioning people to get a new phone every 2 years when they had contracts. Now everyone thinks its normal to have to buy one every two years. Marcelove Everyone? Nope.... Only idiots... Or idiot prostitutes that keep giving their money to someone that only want to screw them. Michael Jones And yet it isn't. The iPhone 5 got iOS 10 with all the latest security updates. Yes it is missing some features but those people's most personal devices are still very secure. It even got a massive speed boost for those coming from iOS 9. The amount of insecure Android devices running around due to the update problem is insane. Duder12 Google doesnt have control of the processor like apple does which means no drivers. John Doe Then Google shouldn't be charging what Apple does LoL Kiko Eschobar Exactly lol... Zsolt V I'd rather have a full set of updates for a shorter period of time than a gimped update designed for you to buy the latest color of a 4-year old design. Michael Jones Google has been making devices for a while now. They are also one of the richest companies in the world. If they actually wanted to support these devices for longer they would be trying to put it in their contract with Qualcomm. Money for support goes a long way. Nathan Bryant Have you seen an iPhone 5 run iOS 10? Painful. Michael Jones Still leagues better than it was with iOS 9. Pretty well documented at this point. Timmy Turner I agree about security as far as iOS goes but I know too many people who had to deal with shitty feature updates because they were on older hardware that couldn't handle it. It's no secret that hardware doesn't keep up with software. TheSpaceUnicorn It's not merely an argument, it's a fact that Apple gives their hardware software support for longer than Google. For the most part, the only software features old iPhones don't get are features that require hardware that new iPhones come with. AndroidUser00110001 When Siri was first introduced Apple claimed it wouldn't be available on older hardware but then it has hacked to work on the older hardware... TheSpaceUnicorn I take it you missed the part where I said "for the most part" Zsolt V Let's try to get real. Luckbuckets hey man, if you want google to change it to 5 year and just change the number you see, im sure that might be an option the might entertain. features are a big part of updates and they are covering the phones for security for atleast 3 years. it is what it is Luckbuckets meant to reply to johndoe Timmy Turner Kind of figured lol John Doe The problem is that they are not doing well with software updates/security updates as what their main competitor(Apple) is doing. Luckbuckets they also sell more of those models that google does, if google sold as many pixels as iphone 7's then im sure there would be more concern EcE Add some Android manufacturers on the table, get more negotiating power on your side, sell less phones as the current phones keep getting updated.... oh wait. John Doe LoL that is just a silly argument. Sales have nothing to do with this and if it does then we now know why they aren't selling enough lmao Dmitry Stepanushkin +1. failed. +1 again. now it's +2😀 TheSpaceUnicorn Good thing old iPhones get new features with new iOS updates then, huh? Suicide_Note Yes, it is, because i buy a new phone or two every year, so I'm fine with this. John Doe I guess you are in the minority because more people are buying iPhones than Pixels. I am not saying OS updates are the reason but Apple is obviously doing something right and Google plenty wrong with regards to their "premium devices". Zsolt V Yes, at least you get full set of features for 2-3 years, as opposed to a new version number with a spit-and-polish. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ But you still have to deal with a krApple iPhone. Who wants that other than soccer moms, teeny boppers, "gadget guys" and other the ignorant technophobes who make up the vast majority of iPhoners? Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe you haven't looked at statistics lately, but iPhones are the highest selling mobile devices in the world. So, obviously somebody's buying them... Competitively, how are the Pixel phones doing? 👎🏾 PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ So you believe that something's popularity equates to its inherent higher worth? That's an incredibly juvenile and vapid assumption. Do you also believe that taller beakers always hold more water than shorter ones or that shiny money is always worth more than paper money? :D Knowledgeborn Allah That's not even close to what I said... But yes, if we're being realistic, the iPhone is intrinsically more valuable than the Google Pixel, and every other Android phone for that matter. Why? A lot has to do with hardware and software support. The fact that the Pixel and the iPhone are priced identically, and yet the iPhone (a) holds its resale value for much longer, (b) has a much wider consumer base, and (c) gets supported for much longer by the manufacturer, clearly shows which device has a greater value proposition. Even if we just talk about OEM support for tech devices, that alone puts Apple well ahead of any Android manufacturer. The OnePlus 3T costs around $430 and gets supported for 2 years. That makes the net value for the consumer around $215 per year. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7+ costs around $750 and gets supported for 5 years, making its net value around $150 per year. The iPhone 6s+ still has a general resale value of around $550 or more. Not only is it almost 2 years after since device was released, but that has a higher consumer market resale value than the Google Pixel right now, and that device just came out around 6 months ago! If you honestly think that doesn't say something about its overall value, then what does? Bubba Jones Ah, in my world business users stay with iPhones it is rare to see one with an Android. To make fun of iPhone users calling them ignorant is a sad commentary of yourself. There are plenty of Android users that only know how to make and receive calls, check e-mail, text, that is the extent of their smartphone use. Truly not a bad thing in the least, all it means is that is all they care to know maybe all they need to know. Yes, that include the same demographics you made disparaging remarks of iPhone users. The iPhone may not fit your needs, yet it fits millions upon millions of folks all over this globe. People such as soccer moms, teeny boppers gadget guys, business professionals, military folks, medical practitioners, the legal profession, etc. etc. etc. You are on your high horse, when you step down do be careful where you set foot. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ business users stay with iPhones The only "ignorant" and "sad commentary" here is you believing that "business users" know anything more about technology than the rest of the world. The remainder of your straw man assertions and rebuttals are too tedious to address. Bubba Jones "...The remainder of your straw man assertions and rebuttals are too tedious to address.....", then why did you return a comment? My logical comment must have hit your logic nerve. My reference was not that they know more. Notice that I am stating that the same demographics you disparage for purchasing an iPhone also purchase Android devices. Folks chose the device that best suites them. Also, users migrate between devices as well. Making disparaging comments about folks that chose a device that suites them, but not suites you is a immature thought process. Cellphones are not a religion, political, nor a life and death matter. When someone chooses a device that you do not like do not get your panties in a wad. Their device choice works for them, so be mature thus be happy for them. It is my hope when you are in public, business settings, and with friends and relatives, you do not come across in the same manner about their chosen devices, belittling them and making disparaging remarks as you have here. Instead, in a friendly helpful manner show and explain why Android may better suite them; never ever disparage them. You can do that. EcE ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Borgman I thought it was because Qualcomm stops support for chips after roughly 2 years (for the pixels, 821). So it's not up to Google, but rather QC.

Eclectech well I guess Microsoft wages a little more control over Intel than Google does over Qualcomm. Thomas Larsen Uh no? They're completely unrelated. One platform was mainly used for special embedded products, while the other is made for generic IBM compatible PCs. You still got legacy stuff from the 80's in those bad boys. TheSpaceUnicorn Well, yes, but that's irrelevant because that's not how that works. UtopiaNH Yes, but the primary reason is the architecture of desktop OSes, which have a hardware abstraction layer that mobile OSes do not. This adds overhead that significantly affects the battery life, can cause instability and hardware bricking, and most of all performance of the hardware when the drivers are compiled directly with the OS. Those elements are why no mobile OS is distributed without the primary hardware drivers compiled with the OS, and each of the big three has a different way of handling it. Apple designs their own mobile processors, only supports the limited list of processors and can update the drivers with the OS with no problem. Windows Phone, was distributed with the drivers as part of the OS, which meant microsoft had to wait for Qualcom to release a new processor, then a full release cycle of the OS before support could be added. It meant that every change to hardware, from as basic as a camera, to different button configurations needed to be handled by Windows, rather than the OEMs which slows down iteration of hardware significantly. Google provides the OS uncompiled, and leaves it up to the OEMs to finalize the OS with the drivers needed for each piece of hardware. However, that means both the OEMs, and every single driver provider needs to adjust and test the OS and compile a new update. Since Radios are a major part of all phones, and they affect networks, this adds in an extra layer of the carriers having a say in the devices using those radios, and they can throw a monkey wrench into the process with any device (both windows phone and android suffered this), and the only reason Samsung, Google, and Apple have been able to push OSes without a ton of carrier interference is deals, market power, etc. Windows Phone's advantage of controlling the drivers allowed them to avoid OEM interference, and provide updates, but they couldn't provide them with carrier approval so no OTA updates and had to be downloaded manually, and even still, they end of lifed stuff when Qualcom EOLed them anyway. The only way Google can eliminate this for their own devices is to do what Apple does and design their own processors, and even then they have to still deal with carriers and can end up with stuff like Verizon exclusivity just to be able to distribute their own updates. There are other drivers that can break, but they aren't at the same fundamental level as the SOC is. 4Ui812 Thanks for the detailed explanation 👍 Francois Roy Big OEMs like Google and Samsung could easily negotiate longer support periods from Qualcomm. Support is part of the deals they make. They simply rather keep the money/don't care. Support for 100% Exynos models (Note 2, GS3, GS4) wasn't any longer than the other models at the time. UtopiaNH An OEM actually is disincentivized to provide longer term support since it both costs money, and has low demand from the public perspective, and actually is counterproductive to future sales. Google however is more incentivized due to it not being entirely an OEM, and caring more about the view of the general public for the security of Android, and honestly any deals they make don't fix all the other companies out there still causing issues. Google does not order enough volume from Qualcom to demand or make deals for longer support. In fact part of Google's Nexus team's issues over the years has been fighting over open sourcing the drivers they use for each Nexus device, and Qualcom fought against that pretty damned hard (for example, this is why the Nexus 6 was missing hardware encryption). To me, as an engineering solution it makes more sense to simply make Android more and more modular, so updating the base OS is less and less important and more can be done OTA with no interruption. If they can get Security patches outside the base OS and all system apps outside it, there won't be nearly as much issue or pressure to get any hardware update coordination. Rod Although your post was very informative, I suggest you use more paragraphs. It makes reading way easier. RainMotorsports Android had a HAL. Samsung abstracted the hell out of it's version of Android back in the ice cream sandwich days for exynos hardware. Not sure about any others and or newer versions. They had a major change to the abstraction layer for the radios at one point that locked source built rooms out of using newer modem firmware. destinyhud to put it differently. Intel update their processor more than qualcomm. they are also difference in OS, embedded vs non embedded os 2×4 until google makes their own chip, then they may consider 3+ like Apple Zsolt V Yup, that's what Google should do. Slap a new version number on a gimped update. Dmitry Stepanushkin Are we gonna get another beta testing in hardware? Google better do its job as software company. Suicide_Note Shhh! People don't like facts around these parts when those facts don't support their argument. bekifft Kind of, but Qualcomm will tell you that the OEMs don't support the device longer than two years. And OEMs will tell you Google doesn't support it for more than two years. And Google will tell you Qualcomm doesn't support it for more than two years. And Qualcomm will tell you... someone755 I'm blaming Google. Why in the world would Qualcomm keep supporting hardware when none of their customers are using/supporting it anymore? If Google says "Android phones will live for 2 years", qcom has no incentive to support the devices for any longer. bekifft I tend to agree, Google is the one that can break that cycle, really the only one. Reminds me of Microsoft and Intel back in the day. M. Luciano Google can't break it. Who is Qualcomm going to cater to? Google's 5 million devices per year or Samsung's 50? bekifft You may be right about this actually. But Samsung tried to make their own OS and it didn't work out in phones for them, arguably in anything. Google could change the Android Compatibility Document to apply pressure. I just don't think it's a priority for them, if anything they see it as a good thing, to sell more phones. M. Luciano Google is a tiny OEM. Samsung sells 10x their volume and has been doing so for years. Google is a 9 month old OEM with less than 10 million sales. Qualcomm couldn't give a f less what Google wants for support, at this point. pfmiller I guess you'd be surprised what companies would do for a little extra cash. M. Luciano Which Samsung is giving them, not Google. As soon as Google becomes a major player as an OEM or starts tapping Qualcomm to help with Google's own custom SoC, then Google will have some weight to throw around. someone755 Google is a tiny OEM but a huge company. They dictate how long Android devices should be kept up to date for, because they own Android. M. Luciano "owning" Android doesn't give Google the right to dictate support life-cycles or update schedules to the OEM's. And either way, that doesn't impact Qualcomm. Google only has bargaining power with Qualcomm insofar as their own contract with Qualcomm to supply parts and support for their own devices. Amit_N This is the sole reason why there should not be a monopoly in any market. I really hoped that Intel would succeed which will keep pressure on QC but that hasn't happened yet. Marcelove Yeah, even if Google wanted to change that, it hasn't leverage to do nothing against this scenario right? ? Geoff Johnson Or get mad at Google, who then in turn could require Qualcomm to support it for 3 years instead.... Nathan Bryant The average life of just about any phone is 2 years. Software updates reaching that time and beyond will cripple your device. Phones aren't made to keep working at their best or even at a quality level beyond that. Your performance and battery life will be absolutely​ terrible. iPhones are perfect examples of this. My friend has an iPhone and has stuck with the platform for several years. The newest one is only a pleasurable experience when it first comes out. Going on after a year you start to notice a decline in performance and definitely battery life. Even with their continued updates the device is just crippled. I experienced this with an iPhone before. For all I know it can be a conspiracy as to why phones tap out around that time. I honestly think they're just built to last about that long before needing to purchase a new battery, external battery, or time to upgrade. pfmiller It used to be that upgrading every 2 years made sense since the hardware improvements each year were substantial. That's no longer the case. My N5 still runs quite well. TheSpaceUnicorn I've never felt the experience of an iPhone diminishes so much that getting a new one any sooner than 3 years is worth it. Once you hit the 3 year mark, however, it goes downhill fast. By contrast, most android phones start to feel ancient by the time they turn 2, imo. That said, I have no intention of replacing my Pixel XL until it turns 3, and I won't be missing any major android updates, as I'll just buy the pixel that launches with the first version of android the Pixel XL won't receive (Android Q) Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Its Qualcomms fault. pfmiller I don't really buy that, but even if it's true I don't really care. I'm Google's customer. If Google's suppliers are a problem it's Google's problem to deal with. MisterAlex Eh, they'll realize whatever sales numbers tell them. I didn't want to drop over half a grand on a two-year device; I'll just keep using my Nexus for now. What's the support life on an iOS device? Do those "last" longer? M. Luciano That'll happen as soon as Google starts fabing their own chips. [A]dri[A]n Well Google, Qualcomm and all the OEM's need to sell new products​somehow. Can't do that when you're supporting products for too long. Simple as that. If they just keep on supporting existing devices, people would be more inclined to keep what they already have instead of going out and buying the shiny new stuff. pfmiller If people decide not to buy from them again because Apple has better support that benefits them even less. [A]dri[A]n But that's not gonna happen, so yeah... Haha Android has way too much pull in terms of market share. Marcelove Google already knows that... But people gave happily their butts to the company, so why Google should bother to change the system? ᔕTOᖇᗰ ᔕᑭIᖇIT You hope that from a company who doesn't even know how many messaging apps are 'adequate' to push down our throat. Timmy Turner That's the way it's always been though. Yoann Ferret Well, that's the way it always sucked. Shouldn't they improve that? Sruly J Of course they SHOULD, it's just a matter of if they WILL. EcE There was never any indication it would be improved. John Doe Did you not watch the Pixel announcement? They were bragging about how they control the hardware and software now and it allows them to do things they couldn't before...I guess keeping the phone up to date for longer than 3 years wasn't one LoL EcE Remember how they were bragging about Allo and how awesome it would be? pfmiller This is the first device they put out that they really treated as a "premium" device and a direct competitor to the iPhone. When you hike the price of a product people kind of do expect better support. EcE As I said before and Google is probably saying right now: ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Do I think it's ok? Absolutely not. It matches iPhone's prices, it should match iPhone's support. Watch how long it will take before someone comes and says: "but the Pixel 2 will be the true Google phone, the Pixel never was intended to be a true Google phone". pfmiller It's fine for you to shrug your shoulders, but it's unacceptable to get the same response from Google. They're actually in a position to do something about it. EcE That's the thing though. They have never done anything about it. Take a look at their hardware history, phones, tablets, laptops, OnHub... Again, I don't support this behavior but at this point I don't expect any better from them. Timmy Turner Security wise yes, but OS software wise no. Technology software advances too fast and hardware doesn't age well. Google has to continually improve Android OS as a whole. Just look at how a new software update can crush performance on older iPhones. pfmiller If a phone's hardware is incapable of running the new software that's a legitimate reason to stop upgrading it. Google stops upgrading them well before the hardware is incapable of running the newer versions though. Kiko Eschobar That's assuredly false. The HTC One M7 stopped getting official updates two years ago, but has ROM support up to 7.1.2 with NO hardware performance limitations AT ALL. Google has brainwashed the lot of you into thinking there's compatibility issues when they simply don't feel like putting in the effort software wise. You gonna tell me won't be able to run Android Q without issues? Thomas Larsen Hardware performance != compatibility. Fact of the matter is that Google doesn't have exclusive control over how hardware is supported which does influence officially sanctioned releases. Hackers don't need permission to tinker around. pfmiller Umm, did you actually read what I wrote? Kiko Eschobar Sorry, replied to the wrong guy. I suck at this forum thing... Timmy Turner I agree they do stop support a tad early. For instance I'm sure the Nexus 6 could've easily run the current Nought build yet it's stuck at 7.1.1, sure they have reason. Would be nice to know what it is beyond cost alone for development. Grunty Its almost like it was predictable to everyone but you. Suicide_Note Not sure if you're okay with/upset by this. Hmmm... Corbin Davenport The latter. Duder12 Why dont you guys write about how Qualcomm is fucking this up every year? https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ EcE Now, this is a good idea. I'm sure a certain guy at Ars could do the same. Duder12 Right? If Ars and Android Police did some good research and wrote some big articles on Qualcomm fucking up Android it would be HUGE> bekifft Ron Amadeo did lay this out quite nicely once, but I can't seem to find it. Duder12 Same goes for anyone with a $850 s8+ except much worse. mondeca Samsung doesn't make the OS. Duder12 Youre right but Qualcomm does and they only contribute their drivers for 2 years. cadtek91 Yes they do, well they build it anyway from AOSP. So if Samsung wanted to make an Android O build right now they could. But in two years QC won't be supporting the sd835. Corbin Davenport The Android O Developer Preview isn't in AOSP. Necdet Ali Özdür How is it much worse? Samsung supports it's flagship devices as much as Google does. 2 years of major OS updates and 1 extra year of security patches. It's not good at all, but not much worse either. blenderboy One more thing Google has to do next to be no different than other normal Android manufacturers. Sell the current pixel for half the price when the new pixel comes into market. My expectations of pixel becoming on par with iPhone just went out of the window. They should have at least provide security updates for 5 years. Duder12 Corbin, Read this: https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ james fuston Yes, just like the $94,000 BMW M5 gets the same 4 yr/50,000 mi warranty as a $33,000 BMW 3 series does. You're paying for the hardware, not the support. bekifft But that extra money buys you retail locations with real people, and easy warranty returns, and generally higher quality hardware, and that cool logo on the ba- wait, maybe I'm thinking of someone else... Kevin Davis 😂 lmao. Good one, bud. I was just going to say you went to an Apple Store, until I got to the end of your comment. Marcelove You've accepted be Google's prostitute the day you bought a Dead Pixel... So why are you upset about being fu**ed by the company when you happily gave your ass to it many months ago? My name is…. That why i say pixel is a bad buy Max Johnson Jokes on you to spend $400 for that 5X. Sason Rashidi I'm glad now i didn't get the Pissel Sruly J What about the Pixel? Phil Do you expect to receive updates for longer from any other OEM? Suicide_Note In other words, the Pixels are treated just like Google's other phones. Not sure why anyone expected anything different. I'm fine with this. Dallas King Because it was priced as a flagship? Duder12 Google cant tell Qualcomm what to do. Qualcomm controls the "official" drivers for SOCs . If you didnt notice Qualcomm has a complete monopoly on the SOCs in the US and dictates all terms. When are people going to finally learn this? Sebastian Google can also make reasonable contracts like "I'll buy XX million of your SoC if you support it for at least 4 years." - problem solved. Duder12 Oh is that how it went for you when you did your SOC negotiation with Qualcomm? I didnt realize it was so easy and Qualcomm would be happy to sacrifice future SOC sales that easily. Tell us more. blackice85 Yeah the real fix is for Google to make their own SOC, but as mentioned already that's no simple task. Sebastian Yes, Qualcomm would be sacrificing nearly everything because of the Pixel being the top seller in the Android market... I knew I missed something while writing my first comment... EcE True. But I'm sure they could IF they wanted to. mattcoz Sure they can, they can whip out the checkbook and write down whatever number it takes. Suicide_Note Aaaaaand? i_say_uuhhh I really wished it would be 3 year/4 year security. Duder12 You can thank Qualcomm for this. Santi Ginestet If google had wanted to update the devices 3/4 years, qualcomm would provided the drivers. I'm very sure. Google is so much bigger than qualcomm Duder12 Have you ever heard of small non existent companies suing huge corporations due to patents? Qualcomm has the patents. Qualcomm has the power. Santi Ginestet Motorola too........ But anyway, they are working together Google and Qualcomm right? Duder12 Qualcomm updates their drivers for 2 years and there is no if and or but about it. If they supported longer it would hurt sales for them since that means less handset sales down the road. They control all the radio patents in the US which are bundled with the processor and gpu. Santi Ginestet Ok i saw it: https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ May be you were right... Santi Ginestet Then a new argument is out, what happens with mediatek devices and updates? Duder12 Pixels dont use mediatek because they CANT. Santi Ginestet I KNOW! I WASN'T TALKING about google pixel devices, i was talking about any mediatek device, i'm sure it hasn't got 2 years of updates. Duder12 Than your argument belongs in a different article Xchris That's fine with me. I'll be getting the pixel XL 2 anyway Duder yeah me too Santi Ginestet And i will buy the "old" pixel 1 to people like you! Jajaja marcusmarcus2 Google be like https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnt8Thwuy7Pr8EU/giphy.gif Dallas King "... it also means that the company is sticking to its two-year version/three-year security updates promise." Yeah, we'll see about that. Hopefully, but I'm not holding my breath. Sruly J @corbin_davenport:disqus Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't there talk for a while that Google is working on their own processor, and if they do come out with one and use it for future devices, it would enable them to support devices for longer? Duder12 yes and yes but not this year. Sruly J Yeah, probably should have mentioned that, although considering when those reports came out, and how long something like this could take, I figured it was a given not this year. ;) Corbin Davenport There were rumors, but I don't recall if they had any credibility. Duder12 Google has already said on record last fall that the Pixel gives them that opportunity. That tells you they are at least trying to make it happen. 9To5Google reports on this stuff. I dont get why AndroidPolice doesnt seem to know much about this topic. Corbin Davenport Having the opportunity to develop SoCs in-house and actually working towards that are two separate things. Duder12 It was a very promising statement. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-04/behind-the-pixel-google-s-first-real-threat-to-apple-s-iphone Also, read this about qualcomm's lack of SOC support: https://9to5google.com/2016/12/24/why-chromebooks-dont-use-qualcomm/ Sir_Brizz I think Qualcomm is in "turning a tanker" territory at this point. We all know it's mostly their fault. Thomas Larsen Think there were rumours of them hiring some hardware people, but it's not even that simple, getting their own silicon out would be a pretty massive undertaking. Sruly J Of course it's not simple, especially since something like that could (and would) shake things up (and not necessarily for the better). ASense0fPurpose "No[t] guaranteed..." https://i.imgur.com/mUI1Huo.jpg Xavier Don't iOS devices typically see around 5 years support? Android Police should be more aggressive about coaxing Google (and other flagship manufacturers) to do the same instead of just singing the same old mantra all the time. 3 years support is ok if it's a cheap device, but in the same price range as an iPhone that sort of lousy support should steer people away from Android. Mark McCoskey That's the thing I like about Apple. They update all of their devices. Wish there was a way to update any device I own with pure Android. Cakefish *2 years support. David Thoren Then I guess we can't really count Apple's support as 5 years because they don't typically allow the older devices to have all of the newest features. Bob Marley It's usually due to hardware reasons. Sachin Bahal They sort-of do, but have you used like an iPhone 5 with iOS 9 or 10, you'll notice that it becomes unbearably slow or what iOS users called "iOS slow", this is partly for planned obsolescence, there's no real proof that Apple is doing that on purpose http://globalnews.ca/news/2926170/is-apple-guilty-of-using-planned-obsolescence-to-force-iphone-users-into-upgrading/ Sir_Brizz I don't disagree with this point, personally, however I will say that if Google is trying to position themselves as a competitor to Apple in this arena, they have to be able to compete with Apple. They need to get to 5 years of support, even if it's not on major versions (but it would be easier for them to just support major versions). Xavier Great point about maybe just providing security updates for 5 years. Can't expect Google to keep providing new features for old devices, but should expect to continue secure usage after three years without being a whiz. Miguel Angel My iPhone 5S runs just fine. But it is about a year old. Once you own a device for 3+ years that's when things start to wear down regardless of software. But still it would be great to get 3 years of support instead of 2. Mark McCoskey Google really should extend their OS support to 3-4 years, instead of just 2. Most people don't need a new phone every 2 years. Only those who are hard on their devices, and those who chase new technology. destinyhud i used my nexus 4 for 3 years. I was always on the latest version of the OS for that 3 years. There was this 1 month whe i was waiting for my nexus 6p to show up and thats when i was one version behind. but sure 3 years is not going to hurt either Mark McCoskey Still using my 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6. Waiting to find out what "Taimen" is, or whether an US Android One will be released. james fuston > and those who chase new technology That's kind of the name of the game. Every major US carrier tries to get you to trade in your phone after 12 months for an upgrade. Making money is the entire point of the spec race in smartphone manufacturing. thereasoner You can stay up to date for 3 years/OS versions and securty patches continue into year 4 of the Pixels life. More than enough for most I'm thinking but resale value would improve if a 4th OS version was made available. Thing is, how will the phone perform at that point? Those iPhones that get that old have been known to slow down considerably. mattcoz You don't need to update every 2 years, you'll still be on the latest release through the 3rd year. If you're someone who doesn't have the desire to upgrade after 3 years, you likely don't care that much about being on the latest version of Android anyway. It's not like the phone will stop working. Knowledgeborn Allah Google launched the Pixel to directly compete with the iPhone. That's why the two devices are priced the same. So, given that agenda, why doesn't Google also match the support that Apple gives the iPhone? 2 years of OS updates is pretty ridiculous in 2017, seeing how powerful modern devices are getting. Just to compare the 2 platforms, keep in mind that the iPhone 5 is going to get updated to iOS 10.3.2 when it officially gets released, and the iPhone 5s is getting updated to iOS 11 this summer. Meanwhile, the Nexus 6 is beyond its EOL mark. Let that sink in. Naxx ENVY it sunk in.. feels bad .. can i un-sink it ? Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, un-sink it... 😂😂😂 DKS Funny, I didn't read about this policy on Google's sustainability PR page -- environment.google Theuntje Google.. I love you.. but be more like Apple in terms of updating your phones PANDAMONIUM🚀 I thought Google already did EOD on the Pixel line up, they're pretty difficult to purchase. /s Trysta I know there is some debate as to who exactly is responsible for this. But regardless this sucks. At the very least the 2 years support clock should start the very last day that Google has the pixels for sale. Considering how hard it is to actually purchase these phones, one should be guaranteed 2 years of full support regardless of when they were able to purchase. But obviously that is fantasy, this is reality, and I will continue to wonder if I could survive with an iPhone. Sir_Brizz I don't think it's all that debatable... it's mostly Qualcomm's fault, but partially Google's. mattcoz In reality, the end result would be exactly the same. Whether it's 2 years from release or 2 years from 10 months after release, the latest update you would get is still P. TechGuy22 fuck that better sell my pixel XL before i lose all my money Siddharth Just cant get more excited for all the bugs that would hit the Pixel/XL with Android O and Android P! Adam Hunter Security patches are more important than OS updates. It's good to see Google committing to 3 years for security patches. create812 I can barely hold out for two full years before upgrading anyway. The hardware improvements usually tip the scale for me. Masklayer So... my $30 Windows phone has been supported longer...? PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan It has but Windows Mobile is abbomination and even Microsoft stopped taking it seriously. Virtually all android apps from MS are better than win apps even for desktop. Masklayer k . TechGuy22 i'm sure the phone can update until 2030 but hey, they gonna sell new phones Sir_Brizz No compromises device comparable to the iPhone. 4Ui812 I thought the Fixel was on life support since it's release. Wasn't that why Google kept trying to fix the problems with it ? Jesse Lee Root your damn phones already and run a custom ROM software that includes all the Google updates!! It's your phone, run what you want on it already and STFU Naxx ENVY you mean ,.. run what you want from other developers .. or are you saying we should learn how to code so we can make and port android version to our phones? dur., xtess3ractx Google should really flex some muscle here along with the other OEMs and extend the period by at least a year. An additional 2(4 years total) would be great. Cael Qualcomm wants to sell new chips whispy_snippet Until batteries have significantly better battery longevity it matters little. What good is an up to date phone if you need to charge it every few hours? This is one area where Samsung is taking the lead with their new S8 battery. We'll see if it delivers on the promise, but it's a good aim to have. Jay That argument is irrelevant in parts of the world like Asia. You can walk into a phone repair store, put down 30 usd and walk out with a new battery in an hour. You get get a lot of parts for your phone replaced and half the price that it costs in the u.s. and uk. People keep their phones. whispy_snippet Ok, sure, but that's a non-official work around that likely voids one's warranty immediately. Correct? In theory, you could keep replacing batteries for a decade or more. By extension, your logic implies a phone OEM should provide software support indefinitely. This isn't realistic. I'm not saying Google and others shouldn't commit to longer software support. But given Android phones consist of so many hardware variations it makes ongoing support almost impossible. Apple have the advantage here in that they have tighter control of their hardware meaning they can commit to longer software support. I don't see any of this changing for the broader Android ecosystem any time soon. Google, on the other hand, is probably looking at designing its own chips for the Pixel to help bridge the software update gap to Apple and the iPhone. boop "Ok, sure, but that's a non-official work around that likely voids one's warranty immediately. Correct?" If your phone's in-warranty, get the battery replaced by the issuer. 2 years out, it's likely out of warranty in which case there's nothing to void. "Google, on the other hand, is probably looking at designing its own chips" In the Chromebook space, minimum 6.5 year lifespan (and likely still updated indefinitely afterward), they cooperate with SoC manufacturers to maximize performance in crOS under the [optional] OP1 brand. While I doubt Google would make their own, it's possible OP1 SoCs could find their way to Android phones. whispy_snippet "If your phone's in-warranty, get the battery replaced by the issuer. 2 years out, it's likely out of warranty in which case there's nothing to void." That's a fair point. But my other key point still stands - it's hard for Google and other OEM's to offer software support as long as a company like Apple given the variations in hardware out there running Android. pfmiller Google isn't supporting every hardware variation that Android runs on, they're only supporting the devices they ship. Same as Apple. Jay We aren't talking warranty. We're talking replacing your battery which will allow you to keep your device a little longer. I see your point. You could also stop into a Sony, Huawei, Samsung Etc and get your battery officially replaced by them as well. JD *Check the end of life page for my iPhone 5s* - Smiles Doby Gillis That's because iOS was made by retards for retards. JD Some damn smart retards Enigmatic Psychotic I believe those are called "idiot savants". Leandro Brandão Meanwhile old iPhones getting updates in 2020. Is google just lazy or there is another reason? PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Follow the trend of big boys like Sammy Miguel Angel Google would need their SOC. It's unfortunate Samsung didn't care to update their phones besides having their own. mattcoz That's plenty, that's 3 years being on the latest release and up to date with security. sebastianer I think 5 years would be plenty...but 2.....is less than ok. mattcoz It's really 3 years, it'll get O and P and get security updates until the release of Q and the Pixel 4. Although I think they really should extend security updates past that, gotta keep your stragglers safe. SomeGuy112 It's said this at the bottom of the Pixels official spec page ever since they took pre-orders for the phone. https://madeby.google.com/phone/specs/ BehemothPL I only came here for comments. Btw, it's available in Play Store (well, it was yesterday). Mike What do the Pixel fans have to say ? BTW I'm loving the Galaxy S8+! Naxx ENVY the galaxy s8 gets even less support... that's what they saying LOL Mike Delevopment for Samsung phones are strong on XDA . Too bad I cant say the same for Pixel and Nexus phones. UniBroW Zero chance I'll drop 700+ on a phone that isn't going to see 5 years of updates or at least two once they stop selling them. I do not care what the reason is, it's inexcusable in 2017 and especially for someone that had the clout such as Google e_hekuta Please Google, design a Google SoC to Pixel 3, with 3 years of Android OS Updates :'( Or together with the other manufacturers convince($) to qualcomm to change the polyce of 2 years of guaranted updates, at least in high ends SoCs (835/845) tansuperman This is why people switch to iphone tansuperman All the arguments make no sense. Apple supports their phones, not the soc chop makers they use. wittyname9000 I'm sorry but two years of official OS updates on a device that is as expensive as the Pixel is a bummer. If a ragtag group of dev(s) over at XDA can get things working on much older hardware then Google needs to get it done. Just my two cents. David If you guys don't like that Google doesn't support their devices like Apple then don't buy their phones. It's not going to change anytime soon so you aren't doing anything by complaining about it. I change my phone every year so it doesn't bother me. username_not_valid People keep saying 'blame Qualcomm', but how is it then that lineage/CM ROMS pop up with newer OS versions? Are they using older drivers? If so then it seems like the older drivers work fine. I grant you, often Lineage/CM isnt the most stable thing, but then again its not Google, who should in theory do a better job.

Its business model is a 2-year planned obsolescence. Google's got fuck all control over it. Premsuraj Absolutely pathetic considering the price. Hate to say it but at this price people are better off buying an iPhone NavyVeteran Pixel XL 2 better be over 5.8" or its a no go. 5.5" phones are uncivilized. The 6 inch Nexus 6, aka Shamu was perfect. Still have mine. Morjesta! Its all business, shorter support time span, end-users will upgrade to newer phones. It's not profitable that and end-user keep using a phone for more than 2 years. It's like the urban legend, that says that Apple on its updates, decreases performance on older phones, forcing users to get new ones, even if they are still functional. ericshmerick Uh, Apple is absolutely king here as hard as that is to say. It's no contest if you want to keep your phone for many years. Yes I understand how they are able to do this (i.e. hardware control). Google needs to hop on this with it's Pixel line. Hussain Ahmadi Just another proof that google sucks! Hopefully this year I am switching back to Samsung. Samsung also offers 2 years of update and added to this I am getting a phone that is designed well and its screen looks amazing with tons of options rather than the sepia screens of google which are covered by a huge bezel! Miguel Angel This is not fair, Google needs to do something about Qualcomm and bump it up to 3 years of software support. My old iPhone 5s still gets updates. It's unfortunate the best Android choice for updates doesn't go beyond 2 years for non security updates. And no I don't want to rely on XDA ROMs. Tolgay Günay Google said already their Devices get always 2 Years Support, not longer. God Thanks i haven't switched to Pixel. Nexus 6P for life. Groud Frank At this point I see absolutely no advantage of, say, getting a Pixel XL over a Galaxy Note 8 besides quick updates. Samsung has better hardware and far more useful software. I went from Note 3 to Nexus 6 and I wasn't all that impressed. It's a great phone, besides the painfully slow camera, but I fell for and got disappointed by the 'stock android is so much better' meme. linuxdood um, its not going to last forever?

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Security Conman swindles $100 million out of Facebook, Google in phishing scam Security Conman swindles $100 million out of Facebook, Google in phishing scam By Bindu Nair - Apr 29, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Even tech titans like Facebook and Google can’t escape phishing scams it seems, with a new Fortune report unearthing that the two were duped out of an eyebrow-raising $100 million. Even worse, the sum got accumulated over the course of 2 years, a long time for such a large-scale scheme to go unnoticed. The heist began in 2013 when a Lithuanian man named Evaldas Rimasauskas decided to impersonate Quanta Computer, a Taiwan-based manufacturer, by establishing a company in Latvia with the same name. He then went about forging email addresses, corporate stamps, and invoices to trick his targets into paying for computer supplies. Rimasauskas’ fake credentials appear to have worked since both Google and Facebook’s accounting departments found it convincing enough to pay $100 million all told. The latter apparently approached the US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan once it had cottoned on to the scam in 2015 and asked its help to recover the stolen funds. Also See: Microsoft fixes Word bug used to steal banking info Federal authorities managed to nab Rimasauskas and even got back most of the money he had stashed away in various Eastern European banks last month. They chose not to disclose the companies involved in the scheme when announcing his arrest, only referring to them as the ‘Victim Companies.’ Quanta Computer, Facebook, and Google have all now confirmed that they were Rimasauskas’ targets. The scammer for his part is denying the accusations made against him. He’s being charged with 1 count of wire fraud, 1 count of aggravated identity theft, and 3 counts of money laundering.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Amazon To Reveal A New Echo Device Knight With Built-in Screen Next Month Posted: Apr 29 2017, 5:54am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Technology News   Amazon Echo Look Amazon Knight will Make Echo Speaker More Useful with Built-in 7-inch Touchscreen   The all-new Amazon Alexa is about to be souped up complete with a Knight speaker and 7 inch touchscreen in tow. Amazon is ready to give its Echo speaker a makeover. Also a screen will be among the changes made to this device. May will be the month when Amazon will reveal its new Echo device, according to CNet. It has earned its codename of “Knight”. Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con in Stock Online Echo Look came out earlier this week and it contains a camera to boot. It sells for $200.  Amazon basically got a clarion call to make some changes in its device after Google had its home smart speakers being utilized by many users. Echo didn’t have this feature. Amazon now wants to upgrade its devices so that they can keep up with what Google is churning out on a regular basis. This novel device may allow Amazon to diversify and engage in the betterment of the facilities it provides via its wonderful products. The Echo device will get video chatting and online shopping facilities thereby making it a chief component of every home. Amazon has already sold 8 million Echo devices in the United States.       The novel version of this device will arrive with a 7 inch touchscreen. This is a very big about-turn by Amazon. Its erstwhile devices were cylindrical in design and were handled by and responded to a voice recognition methodology termed Alexa. The new device will be bigger and face upwards so that the screen will be fully visible to the owner. As for the speakers, they will be top notch in their quality and style. Amazon is currently facing a stiff sort of competition from its rivals. The novel Amazon device will have a version of the Fire OS on it. Recently this device was launched in the UK.  As for the Echo, it was made available to all US citizens in 2015. An Amazon spokesperson said that the voice assistant named Alexa functions in the same manner as a Star Trek Computer. The Echo also has concealed microphones in its structure. Echo works in synch with Uber too. Although the maker of this device has still not reached the goal of artificial intelligence that works in a human manner, it is getting there slowly and steadily.   This story may contain affiliate links.

Google posted more of the 2017 I/O schedule, time to plan your own Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/28 3:24pm PDTApr 28, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 111 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares180 Android OS Development Google News More of this year's schedule for Google's I/O developer conference is finally up. At least, more than the last time we talked about it. Not all of the events are on it, as some would likely give away announcements made during the keynote at I/O by their presence on the calendar, but it looks like most of the talks should be there now. If you are planning on attending, as some of us are, then you might want to start figuring out how best to divide up your time. Some of the time slots have 12 different events, so the odds are very likely that you won't be able to make every single talk you want. Things kick off May 17th with a breakfast before the Keynote at 10 AM. The developer keynote follows that at 1 PM after a break for lunch, though there are some talks available during lunch if the subjects appeal to you, or the food doesn't. For the rest of that day and the other two, though, you're on your own to find out what you'd like to attend. Remember that some of the talks will require that you reserve a seat. The schedule will continue to be updated as we get closer to the event. Those of us who may not be there should still take a look, as Google also streams some of the other events and sessions at I/O. That means even if you weren't able to make it to the event, you can still get your developer thing on. The talks that will be streamed are marked on the schedule with a little camera icon, still leaving you with entirely too many choices. If you end up with a scheduling conflict you can always go back and watch some of the old recordings. With that, you might want to prioritize to attend things that aren't being recorded, like the "Office Hours," if you have any unwanted overlap. Another option for those that can't attend are the I/O Extended events. Feel free to check and see if any are being hosted near you. I'll probably be attending the show this way, myself. The official I/O app hasn't been updated for 2017 yet, but feel free to pull it down in anticipation via the attractive widget below, or over at APKMirror. Google has a pretty nice set of tools put together, both in the app and online, for managing your I/O schedule. With the wide selection of talks and events, it's a really good idea to use them.

The privacy critics are dead wrong about Amazon's new A.I. bedroom camera. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 29 April, 2017 21:00 - - - - print email Comments Look! A new Amazon Echo! The Amazon Echo Look is like the original Echo, plus a camera. The $200 device delivers the Alexa virtual assistant. But the camera is optimized for helping you choose clothing to look your best when you get dressed. The Echo Look is a camera for your bedroom. As such, it's being widely slammed as a massive invasion of privacy. But this view is wrong and based on a provably false assumption. I'll tell you exactly how the Echo Look actually improves privacy. But first, let's take a closer look at the Look. Alexa as fashion consultant The Echo Look is shaped like a oversized pill — a cylinder with rounded ends that appears to be about half the size of the original Echo. It sits on a stand or mounts to a wall. Amazon The Echo Look is being slammed as a privacy-violating bedroom camera. The Echo Look's camera is surrounded by LED lights for improving the pictures. The camera activates only with the "Alexa" wake word, according to Amazon. A physical button tells the microphone to stop listening. You activate the camera by saying: "Alexa, take a photo" or "Alexa, take a video." Pictures and videos are uploaded to Amazon's cloud servers, with a copy sent to the smartphone app. A "pop" button blurs photo backgrounds. You can also share or delete photos from the app (you cannot delete photos from Amazon's servers) — or save pictures to a "Lookbook" in the app. The Echo Look offers a service called "Style Check." This combines the fashion sensibilities of both artificial intelligence (A.I.) and human "fashion specialists" to help you choose between two outfits based on "fit, color, styling, seasons and current trends," according to Amazon. With "Style Check," you simply pick two photos, and the feature tells you which one is better. Another feature called "Inspired by Your Look" suggests brands compatible with your style (in my case, any brand that makes jeans and t-shirts). Technically, the Echo Look could use face recognition to switch user accounts in the same way the Google Home switches accounts using voice recognition, although this feature has not been announced and Amazon did not respond when I asked. Big Brother is watching you... get dressed Privacy experts are gnashing their teeth over the Echo Look. The original Echo put a microphone in your kitchen. The Look puts a camera in your bedroom. Amazon takes customer privacy seriously, according to a company representative I spoke to for this column. Amazon's security measures include "disallowing third-party application installation on the device, rigorous security reviews, and encryption of images and communication between Echo Look, the Echo Look app, and Amazon servers." Amazon doesn't provide any personal information to advertisers or third-party sites that display Amazon's interest-based ads, according to the company. In other words, Amazon is confident that nobody except the user and Amazon will ever see your Echo Look photos and videos. So what will Amazon itself do with the imagery? Photos contain data. That data can be extracted using A.I. Given the current state of machine learning, the Echo Look could do so much more than judge your clothes. There's no technical limitation preventing Amazon from using the Echo Look to guess your mood, weight gain or loss, pregnancy, sexual orientation and other facts about you. Photos also may contain data about your room or house — your furniture, carpeting, color preferences, amount of clutter or minimalism and what kind of artwork you have hanging on the wall. All this visual data harvesting and processing could help Amazon sell you things, skewing Amazon results accordingly or offering its observations to partners selling on Amazon.com. All this is theoretically possible. But they told me unequivocally that they have no intention of extracting signals from images for the personalization of results on Amazon.com. Can we trust Amazon? Certainly, Amazon can be trusted to act competently in the service of its own corporate self interest. That means Amazon can be expected to do whatever it can to keep your images and data from being hacked, it will maintain policies designed to not freak people out too much about privacy, and that it will use the data gathered now and in the future to encourage you to spend more at Amazon.com Ultimately, Amazon's only interest is in selling you things — which is to say, to figure out exactly what you want and offering it to you. Imagine visits to Amazon where literally everything you see on the site is precisely what you're looking for, matches your tastes and preferences and fits you perfectly. (Amazon told me that the Echo Look cannot currently estimate clothing sizes, but wouldn't speculate about the possible introduction of that ability in the future.) In other words, the worst-case "harm" caused by Amazon's "abuse" of the Echo Look is: more relevant ads and search results — more showing you what you really want and less showing you what you don't want. Yes, Echo Look photos, videos and data could be accessed by hackers, criminals, governments and others. But even if all that happens, it doesn't matter. How the Echo Look improves privacy The Echo Look does not represent a new level of privacy invasion into our bedrooms. In fact, it improves privacy. Amazon The Amazon Echo Look works just like the original Echo, plus it uses a built-in camera to help you get dressed. In a perfect world, our privacy would be assured by never allowing cameras into our bedrooms and bathrooms. However, we don't live in that world. In the real world, there are two kinds of people: Those who want to take pictures of themselves after getting dressed and those who do not. If you have no interest in photographing your "outfits" in the morning, then you will not buy an Echo Look. Your privacy will not be violated in a new way. But if you do take pictures while getting dressed and share them on social media, the same is true: Your privacy will not be violated in a new way. If you take bedroom or bathroom selfies and share them publicly, Amazon already has access to your photos. Take a look for yourself on Google Image Search. Or browse the Instagram hashtag #OOTD (the initials for "outfit of the day"), which returns 122 million results. All the things privacy critics say Amazon could do with Echo Look selfies, the company can already do using the pictures people have already taken and posted online. So can Facebook, Google, China, the National Security Agency — anyone. The only privacy difference between taking selfies with a smartphone and an Echo Look is that the Echo Look can give feedback privately using the "Style Check" feature. Taking a picture with a smartphone and getting feedback on the outfit involves that picture being backed up in the cloud by Apple or Google, sending it out onto social networks, messaging apps, text messaging or email. Taking a picture with a smartphone and sharing it online is incredibly insecure. In other words, the Echo Look's main privacy difference is an option for privacy that didn't exist for people already using a camera to get feedback on their clothing. The Echo Look is brilliant and will succeed wildly From a product standpoint, the Echo Look is pure genius. It hijacks a widespread behavior and makes that behavior better for the user. Echo Look photos are easier to take than mirror selfies are. They're hands-free. You get multiple angles and consistent lighting. Plus, you get a more private option for getting feedback on your outfit. It markets itself, too. Users will start sharing Echo Look pictures on Instagram, Twitter and elsewhere with their friends, who will see the pictures and want the device. It helps Amazon maintain leadership in the virtual assistant appliance game, which helps Amazon sell more stuff. Amazon's somewhat surprising introduction of the Echo Look (after early leaks pundits guessed it was a security camera) coincides with a likely explosion in the category of virtual assistants. Reports suggest that Apple will soon announce a virtual assistant appliance for the home that provides access to Siri, Apple Music and podcasts. Amazon itself may introduce a version of the Echo with a screen, possibly dedicated to kitchen use. It may be announced as soon as next month. The Echo Look will bring the mirror-selfie people into the fold, just as a kitchen Echo may attract the foodie faction — all of which will solidify Amazon's lead in the growing virtual assistant appliance market. So the fears, criticism and negativity around the Echo Look are completely misplaced. The product is another winner. I don't know if Amazon's Echo Look will help you get dressed in the morning. But it definitely makes Amazon look good. Why Performance Matters When Building Your SD-WAN More from Silver Peak Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

CyanogenMod ROM 5.0.7 Is Live! Brings Android 2.1 To T-Mobile MyTouch 3G And G1 Artem Russakovskii Follow View All Posts 2010/04/29 8:06pm PDTApr 29, 2010 0 Plus 1 on G+ 4 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares4 Development Dream G1 (Dream) HTC Magic myTouch 3G (Magic) News Sapphire The moment you, MyTouch 3G and G1 users, have been waiting for is here! Only minutes ago Cyanogen announced the availability of CyanogenMod 5.0.7 ROM (v. Test1) which brings Android 2.1 to MT3G and G1: Full instructions and downloads for this first version (Test1) are available at this CyanogenMod forum post and are cached below (the forum is SLAMMED). G1 users: note that you need "DangerSPL" (or DeathSPL or Haykuro's SPL or whatever you prefer) in order for this ROM to fit onto your phone. After a bunch of hard work from a lot of people, I'm happy to present the first fully-functional Eclair (Android 2.1) system available for the HTC Dream and HTC Magic! #include <std_disclaimer.h>
/*
 * Your warranty is now void.
 *
 * I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards,
 * thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please
 * do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this ROM
 * before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if
 * you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.
 */ There is some new ground being broken here, and a few bugs to still shake out but I believe that it should be pretty stable as a daily driver. Since this is still experimental territory, please help us out with *quality* bug reports (including logs). It's important to know that the "DangerSPL" (or DeathSPL or Haykuro's SPL or whatever you prefer) is a prerequisite for Dream/G1 users. Magic (MT3G etc) users do *not* need to do this. Ciwrl has written a guide to installing this bootloader. Flashing this bootloader under the wrong conditions can actually brick your device, so pay attention to the guide. CM releases have always avoided this requirement, but the new bootloader frees up enough space so that no crazy hacks are required for a fully functional system, and it's easier to keep in sync with the N1/Droid releases. What's NOT included that you'd find on a Nexus One: * Launcher2 (too clunky for these devices) * Stock Live Wallpapers (LWP support is there, but may not work with all LWP apps and/or performance may be bad) * Facebook (install from the Market, contact sync works perfect) * Google Voice (install from Market, push notify works perfect) What's included: * Everything that goes with Eclair * 3D, video, camera, camcorder, BT, WiFi, etc are all of course working CyanogenMod extras: * Can be used with or without Google applications * Kernel 2.6.33.3 with tethering support, Compcache, VPN/tun, and other modules (cifs, nfs, aufs, fuse) * New Apps2SD method implemented mostly by Chris Soyars. * Built in USB tether * Graphical enhancements, #boobs, and excellent wallpapers by Prash and SatanR1 * Includes BusyBox, htop, nano, powertop, openvpn, bash, irssi, and all engineering commandline utilities * FLAC audio support from Kenny Root * Phone enhancements from Cytown * Contacts enhancements from Wysie * MMS enhancements from, well, everyone (see changelog) * Perform zipalign-on-install of applications * DeskClock tweaks- longer autosilence and "require unlock" option * Massive APN list * All available locales are included thanks to PsychoBoy * 360-degree auto-orientation by Optedoblivion and Elanthis (enable in settings) * OpenVPN integration thanks to James Bottomley * Music app can respond to long-press on the volume buttons (from Metalhead) * Many other bugfixes and tweaks from AOSP contributors * Tons of work on the build system by Koush and Chris Soyars * See the full CHANGELOG for all credits and details All source code is available at the CyanogenMod Github! Send pull requests with your changes! INSTRUCTIONS: - First time flashing CM5? 1. Unlock your device and install Clockwork Recovery (ROM Manager on the market) or Amon_RA's recovery image 2. Do a Nandroid backup! 3. Install the DangerSPL if you don't already have it 4. WIPE (I cannot guarantee an upgrade from CM-4.2 to CM-5 will work) 5. Install the ROM 5. Optionally install the Google Addon - Upgrading? 1. Do a Nandroid Backup! 2. Install the ROM (your Google apps will be backed up and restored automatically) HOW TO REPORT BUGS OR PROBLEMS? - Was it a hard reboot? Get me the file "/proc/last_kmsg". - Was it a soft reboot or a "boot loop"? Run "adb logcat" and get me the full output. - Pastebin links preferred - Please use the issue tracker whenever possible! Latest version: 5.0.7-DS-test1 - 04/29/2010 Download: http://kanged.net/mi...est1-signed.zip MD5Sum: d22c7940de66a490f241814cea4409ee Google Addon: EPE54B Download: http://kanged.net/mi...E36B-signed.zip A few known issues; * Camera zoom doesn't work yet, and the preview displayed after taking the picture is garbled. The actual picture is taken fine, though. * Layout of the pattern-lock and no-sim screens need adjustment Thank you to EVERYONE involved in helping with testing, coding, debugging and documenting!

Education Databases: Searchable databases on demographics, test scores, financial information and te By the Editorial Board / Published: April 29, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Technology readily is available to detect methane leaks. Google’s Street View cars, for example, are equipped with methane “sniffers” to detect leaks. Yet, Pennsylvania has not yet mandated readily available technology to detect and prevent leaks from large-scale gas drilling, processing and distribution. (Associated Press File) Environmental protests aren’t unusual these days due to a change in the federal administration, which likely will produce reduced regulation. It was unusual recently when environmental activists in Scranton and several other Pennsylvania cities protested against Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf over methane regulation. The governor gave himself a bit too much credit recently when he said that he has “instituted methane emissions standards” that are among the strongest in the country. Methane is the main constituent of natural gas, of which Pennsylvania has become the nation’s second-most productive state. The gas burns much more cleanly than coal but methane is among the most destructive greenhouse gases. Leaks can diminish methane’s effectiveness as an environmentally friendly fuel. Wolf introduced strong regulations in January 2016 — to, in effect, require the use of known best industry practices to detect and prevent leaks, and specific reporting of emissions. That would produce some costs for the industry, which already sporadically employs the technology. But it also would capture more methane for sale, mitigating those costs. Industry acolytes in the Legislature have attempted to scuttle the proposed regulatory regime. That is dangerous, given the Trump administration’ reduced regulation. Pennsylvania should be a leader in gas production and clean air, which need not be mutually exclusive concepts.

Casio G'zOne Commando Review: Built Like A Tank, And About As Fast As One, Too Jaroslav Stekl Follow View All Posts 2011/05/15 3:24pm PDTMay 15, 2011 1 Plus 1 on G+ 13 Share on Facebook 32 Share on Twitter Total Shares14 Casio G'zOne Commando Phone Reviews Reviews Verizon Wireless Article Contents 1 At a Glance 1.1 The Good 1.2 The Bad 2 Hardware 2.1 Ruggedness 2.2 Design and Build Quality 2.3 Display 2.4 Camera 3 Software 4 Performance, Battery Life, and Call Quality 5 Conclusion The Casio G'zOne Commando is a phone that knows what it is and what it isn't. It is not, for example, Casio's answer to the Galaxy S II or the EVO 3D - it simply doesn't have that much power under its rough, tough hood. But that rough, tough hood is precisely what makes the Commando stand out from the rest of the Android smartphone crowd - unlike your average piece of plastic, it is ready to take on the challenges of an outdoorsman's life (including but not limited to being submerged in water, thrown onto cement, or given the inevitable drop kick from time to time). As should be expected, it passed our durability tests without any sign of weakness, so really, the only question left is whether the rest of its features are any good. At a Glance The G'zOne Commando's spec sheet makes it clear that power users weren't exactly Casio's target demographic here: 3.6-inch WVGA (800x480) TFT LCD display (covered by Gorilla Glass) 800/1900MHz CDMA EVDO Rev. A radio WiFi 802.11b/g/n Bluetooth 800 MHz processor 512MB of RAM 1GB of ROM 8GB microSD card included 1460mAh battery 5MP rear camera Android 2.2 (Froyo) with Casio's custom overlay Meets Military Standards 810G for immersion, rain, vibration, salt fog, humidity, solar radiation, altitude, low and high temperature storage; shock and dust resistant The Good Rugged design that can withstand just about anything you throw at it (or throw it in) Sharp, colorful display Verizon's extremely reliable 3G network  G'zGear, a unique app that provides everything a camper could wish for: a compass, a walking counter, a thermometer, a star gazer, adventure training, trip plotting, tidal graphs, and sunrise/sunset/moonrise/moonset times. Better yet, the Commando features a physical shortcut button that, when pressed, takes you right into the app The Bad Underwhelming call quality Touchscreen isn't as responsive as I'd like Performance leaves something to be desired - not to mention just how obsolete the 800MHz processor will be by the time your two-year contract is up The phone ships with the now-antiquated Android 2.2 (Froyo); worse yet, Verizon has included oodles of bloatware as well as Bing... that should speak for itself In a sentence: The Casio G'zOne Commando isn't the fastest or most feature-packed Android handset on the market, but it sure is durable. You should buy it if: Ruggedness is your top priority and you don't mind a slightly second-rate smartphone experience. Still with us? Good, because there's a whole lot more info below - read on! Hardware Ruggedness This is really the G'zOne Commando's main selling point, so we'll address it right off the bat - as its specs (see above) indicate, the phone has passed military testing and is, supposedly, ready to be dropped, thrown, submerged in water, given the boot, or forced to undergo some other method of torture altogether. For the most part, our testing verified that claim. Even after being catapulted against a wall and dropped on concrete multiple times, the Commando not only remained in one piece, but managed to get by with no more than two small battle scars. Impressive to say the least. Water-resistance was a similar story. For obvious reasons, I didn't leave the phone submerged for long, but I did dunk it in a few times, and I was pleased to find that the phone emerged unscathed. Due to elements out of Casio's control (damn you, physics!), the touchscreen isn't very responsive underwater, but you can answer calls while the phone is immersed nonetheless. There really isn't much more to say here; the water-resistance is a nice party trick, and it could certainly come in handy if you're a hiker and you accidentally drop the phone in a stream. So long as... Be warned that if you submerse the handset without first covering its ports, water could get into it, effectively turning your phone into an outrageously expensive black brick.    Design and Build Quality Really, the only adjective suitable for the Commando is "manly" - from the eight shiny gray screws (four on the front; four on the back) to the formidable diamond shape, it's obvious that this phone just wasn't made for the couturiers among us. It also wasn't meant for those with small hands - though its screen is rather diminutive compared to most modern smartphones, its monolithic bezel and bulky exterior (the thing is 0.6 inches thick) will likely scare off Lilliputians. It was, however, aimed squarely at the tough, outdoors-loving guys. If any doubt about this was left in your mind after reading the "Ruggedness" section, it'll disappear the moment you lay your eyes on the phone itself.    Scratch that; even if you were blindfolded during your first encounter with the Commando, you'd probably be able to figure out what sort of gadget you're dealing with. The first clue should be its weight: at 5.45 ounces, it's definitely more of a Hummer than a Honda. But that's not all; the sharp edges and generally metallic hand-feel certainly add to its macho status. And then you open your eyes and see what you're holding. Let's start by describing the phone's two ports: one is for microUSB, while the other is a 3.5mm headset jack. Both are sheathed by rubber flaps, which keep the device's innards dry even when submerged in water. They feel a wee bit flimsy, and to be honest, I prefer the sliding doors that cover the Galaxy S' ports, but... they're rubber flaps, and they serve their purpose. Continuing along the Commando's left side, you'll find a camera button - always a nice addition - as well as an awkwardly placed notification light (it can be hard to see when you're holding the device directly in front of you). Spin the phone 180° to access the volume rocker, a shortcut button which opens the G'zGear app by default, or the power button. The last of these three items can be somewhat frustrating, as it is situated in the lower left-hand corner, where your palm is apt to rest if you're holding the phone in your left hand. A minor issue, to be sure, but it did occasionally force me to let go of the device just so I could turn it off. Flip the Commando over and you'll be confronted with its black and red backside. The screws that punctuate it add to the aforementioned manly aesthetics, as do the symbols representing the hardships the phone can face. However, you'll need fingernails practically as long as Rihanna's to pry off the battery cover - you'll likely spend about an hour trying to get it off after moving the lock/free switch to the appropriate position. And don't even get me started on replacing the damn thing. I understand why the process is so complicated (it likely has to do with the phone's water- and damage-resistant nature), but that doesn't make it any less infuriating. Other than the impossibly hard-to-remove battery cover, the back holds the 5MP camera (more on that in a bit), its accompanying LED flash, a secondary microphone, and a green indicator light that blinks whenever the camera app is open - nice touch. If you've ever seen a Casio G'zOne handset before, you should already have a good idea of what the front of the Commando looks like. Black plastic, red highlights, visible silver screws - we've seen it all before. It's not seductive or fashionable à la Galaxy S II, but it does exhibit ruggedness and durability. The bottom bezel contains the speaker grille and the microphone, while the top counterpart is home to the bright red earpiece, the temperature sensor (on the dotted rectangle), and the light / proximity sensors (on the smooth rectangle). In between the two is, of course, the 3.6-inch display. Speaking of which... Display You'd best look elsewhere if the latest in mobile display technology is what you're after, but all things considered, the G'zOne Commando's LCD isn't bad at all. The WVGA (800x480) resolution looks fantastic on its 3.6-inch screen, and colors are reasonably accurate, if not comparable to, say, Super AMOLED Plus. Despite my premonitions (this isn't exactly VZW's flagship device, after all), I found the viewing angles more than adequate - in fact, they were even wider than those of my EVO 4G. So the screen looks good, but does it respond to your touches well? In a word, no. Responsiveness was actually so bad I had to check the spec sheet to make sure it was a capacitive display. The bad touchscreen made typing difficult (even with the excellent XT9 keyboard), and some games, especially those controlled by a virtual joystick, were hard to play. Frankly, the poor responsiveness is extremely disappointing, though perhaps understandable given the rugged nature of the device. Camera Ugh. The Commando's camera isn't just bad; it's abominable. Seriously, I haven't seen shots this horrible since the epoch of flip phones. Don't believe me? Have a look for yourself:      To add insult to injury, Casio hasn't tweaked the camera app at all; the stock Froyo program has been left intact and featureless as ever. Suffice to say, if you want a great - or even decent - cameraphone, the G'zOne Commando is not the answer to your prayers. Software The good news? Though Casio has included its own custom UI, Android 2.2 (Froyo) has more or less been left intact on the G'zOne Commando - aside from the praise-worthy G'zGear app and a few minor tweaks here and there. The bad news? Bing and a boatload of crapware. I want to emphasize that there's nothing wrong with Microsoft's search engine; personally, I prefer Google, but to each their own. My beef here is that, on a Google device, Verizon has disabled Google search and hacked the software so that, when the search button is pressed, Bing is brought up. It's as option-less as that - there's no way to change the search provider, and voice recognition is done via Bing as well. Oh, and then there's the bloatware. The situation is just as bad as it is on the DROID Charge - no fewer than 17 crap apps, several of which duplicate each other's functionality. For instance, why are there three separate search apps (Bing, stock Android's own Search feature, and Nuance Voice Control)? And if the video tutorials are already accessible via the Setup Wizard, why include another app (Guided Tours) which only serves as a link to said instructional clips? Interestingly enough, the Commando does not ship with Gmail, YouTube, or Google Maps. The first two applications will download automatically when you sign into the Android Market, but the last item on the list must be downloaded from the Market manually. Not an intolerable nuisance, but I don't see why Verizon and Casio couldn't have been bothered to include the programs. Bloatware and de-Googlificiation aside, few tweaks have been made to Android 2.2. The lock screen has been altered, sure, and Casio offers a neat slide-up list of favorite applications (see above), but on the whole, not much has been changed - except for the addition of the splendiferous G'zGear app, that is.     In a sentence, G'zGear is an outdoorsman's best friend. As you can see, the first - and perhaps most noteworthy - tool it offers is a pair of compasses: regular (a simple but useful earth compass) and layer. The latter of these is of particular interest, as it displays mountains, national parks, cities, or other landmarks near you. Its one major downside is the way it switches between layers, or types of public attractions - instead of choosing from a list, you must click a button repeatedly until you arrive at the layer of your choosing. Still, that's a insignificant issue in the grand scheme of things (especially given that almost no other smartphone even offers such an app), and - at least theoretically - it could easily be fixed via a software update. G'zGear's other features - a walking counter, a thermometer, a constellation viewer, adventure training, trip memory, tidal graphs, sunrise/sunset/moonrise/moonset schedules - probably won't be used as much by hikers, campers, and the like, but they're definitely well made and worth a mention nonetheless. The walking counter provides walking directions for some of America's most popular wildlife trails as well as a standard-issue pedometer for measuring your steps. Adventure training, meanwhile, consists of tips and history related to your running habits, based on your height, weight, age, and gender. Trip memory allows you to plot your trekking, hiking, climbing, camping, cycling, paddling, skiing, snowboarding, surfing, running, travel, and "life" trips before sharing the deets via the usual smorgasbord of social services (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, etc.). The last two features of the G'zGear app - sun/moon schedules and a star gazer - do precisely what their names imply (namely, a way to identify stars in the constellation and a timetable for local moonrises/moonsets/sunrises/sunsets), so we won't bore you with a full rundown. All in all, the G'zOne's software isn't anything to write home about, but it's not a complete train wreck, either. If you're an Android purist, this probably isn't your cup of tea - Bing should be reason enough for that - but if you are part of the phone's target demographic, the G'zGear app should be right up your alley, and you shouldn't find the rest of the software too annoying. Performance, Battery Life, and Call Quality Though the G'zOne Commando is not a member of Verizon's LTE arsenal, its 3G speeds are not only more than acceptable, but also far more consistent than those of Big Red's competitors. For example, the Commando regularly got two to three bars of reception, even in the woodsiest of woodsy locations. Speeds ranged from 2-3Mbps - not quite as mind-blowing as what LTE or WiMAX can provide, but nothing to scoff at, either. Call quality, however, was a huge letdown. On every single one of my test calls, the person on the other end of the line reported subpar quality, and the Commando's earpiece is nearly inaudible - I could barely make out what the caller was saying. Big Red's network has, in my experience, been excellent, so I think it's safe to say we can blame Casio for the poor call quality here. Regardless, the G'zOne probably isn't a very good choice if you're into that whole "calling people" thing. Battery life was about average for an Android phone - the Commando's 1460mAh cell easily made it through a day of moderate use (which involved casual game-playing, a few phone calls, and constant email-checking). When used more heavily, it died just after noon. Acceptable, but definitely not exceptional. Finally, general smartphone performance was far from ideal - as you may have guessed from the title, the Commando can indeed get quite sluggish at times. Benchmark scores (1085 from Quadrant; 28.505 MFLOPS from Linpack) reflected that - but with an 800MHz processor, does this impotence really surprise anybody? Conclusion The G'zOne Commando isn't for everyone. Power users will seek more powerful machines, while the average consumer will likely be turned off by all the excess junk in the Commando's trunk. But if you're a hiker, construction worker, or other thrill-seeker, the Commando can't be beat. Sure, at $199, it's not the cheapest G'zOne handset, but it's certainly the best. Whereas previous iterations ran proprietary Casio operating systems, the Commando is powered by Android, and it retains the G'zGear tools Casio fans have come to know and love. In summary, if you're looking for a rugged, durable smartphone, you should take a long, hard look at the G'zOne Commando. For everyone else, however, I can confirm that this is not the DROID you're looking for. Tags 3g Android 2.2 Casio CDMA EVDO Rev.

From looking at the specs, I assumed this would be the case, but I was really looking forward to a decent, rugged device. The line of work i am in, a rugged phone would really come in handy, but i am not willing to sacrifice that much performance for it. Why make something geared towards the outdoors man and not have a decent camera? Fisherman, hunters, or anyone who doesn't work at a desk would love to have something like this. Very disappointing. chris I am currently on the commando and I will unfortunately agree it is slower than my brothers droid x. The camera isn't that bad though, it looks like michael j fox took those pictures after raping the brightness settings Uphor8 Great review as always, Jaroslav. I really like the looks of this phone, far more than the DEFY that can also be submerged into water, so I'd probably go with Casio if I needed a rugged device. Both have problems, and I think Casio is more of a sweet spot than the DEFY. Just don't expect to see Gingerbread on it. Logan The inclusion of Bing search and the exclusion of Google services such as Maps would be directly related: the result of an agreement between Casio and Microsoft. Jaroslav Stekl I'd actually say it's an agreement between Verizon and Microsoft, as we've seen Bing on some of Big Red's previous Android phones (i.e. Samsung Fascinate). But yeah, either way, it sucks. Zackery Fretty Yup, that's for sure something that's locked to Verizon (and yes it sucks). My AT&T Samsung Galaxy S phone (Same family as the Fascinate) doesn't have a lick of Bing on it and never will. Lester I have had one for 5 months and very pleased with its durability! Have dropped it a few times stepped on it after dropping it in a gravel driveway with the screen down and still no damage to phone or screen! Also left it outside in truck bed over night in a rain storm still no damage! It does have a few downfalls but they are worth the durability! Ray Can you download the google search engine in addition to google maps? Does it have video or just a regular camera? Matt We're "field testing" one right now. Superintendent on a construction job site. He is currently enjoying the phone and does like the fact its very rugged. Mike I've had mine a few days.. not impressed with the battery. Much less up-time than my original Moto Droid. It overheats and I'm down to 33% at 9:50a.m. (took it off the charger at 7!!!) Mark I have had my Commando for a week, during which I ran errands, played 18 holes of golf in the rain (charity event) and then went fly fishing for 5 days, where it rained again several times over 2 of the 5 days. The Commando came through all the wet just fine and works great. I get a great connection even miles from any roads on a trout stream, found the voice call quality to be pretty decent (better than the Casio G'zOne Boulder I was using previously), and found the touchscreen to only be a little unresponsive when trying to hit small command buttons with my big fingers (I am 6'4" and 240lbs). I do not agree with the keyboard review, I found the keyboard to work great, even to be a little TOO sensitive (again with the big fingers/thumbs), but found if I rotated the phone to get the larger keyboard then it worked great. Maybe it seems to be unresponsive if you are used to one of the delicate iPhones, but you do not want the screen to be too touchy when your hands are wet/dirty/cold/etc.! I did have the battery get a little warm once or twice when I was doing a lot of browsing, but the battery lasted all day without any issues. My final review - if you are an outdoors individual, or you do physical work for a living, it is absolutely a great smartphone! Ken Actually posting this from my commando. I also recently upgraded from a boulder, and no its nothing like my buddies droid X but coming from the boulder this thing is amazing. Never thought I could own a smart phone until I saw this phone released. I can honestly say ill never go back to the boulder and would not trade the durability of this one for a easily broken but faster smart phone. Pat Garland Had mine for a few months. Bloatware sucked...rooted it, got rid of Bing and bloatware now works better than ever. Tim how do you root it? totally slow right now! Dbangard94 how did you root yours? Knight2051 Someone needs to give classes on Rooting!!! I am using a HTC-HD2 and hate windows, looking for a replacement. This one might be it, If it is unlockable that is! Eric I've had my commando for a month. i like it. everything about the keyboard, that everyone talks about is correct. its a little sluggish. but what it offers in durabillity, its worth it. today i left it on the tool box and took off down the interstate. halfway to my destination, i realized where i left it. it is the commando so i turned around at the next exit and started my search. 3 miles and i seen it in on the line bewteen the 1st & 2nd lane, on a 3 lane interstate. the speed limit is 65, and i do about 4-5 over it. it was also pouring rain. we were getting left overs of tropical storm lee. to cut it short. other than scratched up case and the auto rotation was broken, everthing else worked. the 2 ports were open when i found it. THATS AMAZING!!! if theres is a person who will put ''anything'' to the test, its me. eric i have had this phone for about 2 months and in the first four days i managed to drop it screen first onto gravel.... since its a glass screen u can only imagine how bad the cracks were. other that that i got my new one and it is the most durable and best cell-phone ive ever had Christopher Siddall Piece of crap! Battery sucks, touch screen sucks. And tough? I dropped it 3 feet to the ground 6 weeks after I bought it and the screen shattered! wicky Was u driving 100 mph when u dropped Your phone 3 feet to the ground? C Mine has been dropped 8 feet onto shower tile and 6 feet ohto concrete, flew into the windshield (cracked the entire windshield but thw phone was perfect), been dropped into a swimming pool (multiple times, but it can only go up to three feet), beennin a hot tub, been in the shower, etc etc. Works fine. For me, that is all I need to know. . . Josh Waters ok i have the commando had it for two days and broke the screen. Also how do you get the flash to work and how do you zoom while taking a photo steve open the camera then the little arrow on the left side of the screen, touch it and you get camera options. there you can turn on the flash and to use the zoom you must change the quality, from 5 mp to 3, 2 or 1, the worse quality the more zoom you can get. Adrian Jenkins Not too impressed with mine. Had for a few months now. Have not put much on it. Keeps freezing up and randomly resetting. Now I am not recieving calls and I can barely call out when I have 2 or 3 bars of service. After fighting with it for a month now I am ready to go back to my Boulder sadly Donny Cotten You can have this phone's screen repaired at http://www.atlantacelltech.com The ONLY place in the US that I have found that repairs this phone. Donny Cotten Correction on address for Atlanta Cell Tech. It's http://www.atlcelltech.com eddie i have one of these "things" and i am glad i only gave 9.99 for it, cause the disadvantages outweight the advantages. i am also not that impressed with verizon. i think they make a lot of boasts they cant back up. Oscar García Still loving this one! Sadly is no more convenient anymore Right now there is some cheaper models with similar specs on the market: rigth now i m thinking on the Agm line! Scott Atlanta cell tech can repair this phone. Turn around was just one day. Great.! nick i have one of these phones and i broke the screen after about 6 months of hard abuse Oscar García Rugged smartphones are far less expensive than rugged mobile computers, making them an effective replacement for outdated mobile hardware. Jen It sounded good when I bought it but sad to say, I have a very expensive etcha sketch now. I demoed it for a friend and through it first then submerged it. the port was not properly closed and now it is that expensive brick you warn about. I like to call it the titanic phone. Be ware of putting this phone in water and damaging your fingers trying to get it to remember it is a touch screen! Hayden mccarney This phone is everything proof except little sisters. My dad has thrown it into walls and gone hunting with it and when he's done he sprays it off with a hose. Then he set it in his pocket and my 1 yr old sister sat on it and shattered the screen Bgenewich Not happy with this stupid thing,my other htc were better Zmann This phone is all Hype get a good protective case for a better phone and move on  Scubastevesfather Why does it freeze up almost every day and sometimes several times a day? Briiian I've owned mine for about 8 months now.  It was certainly neat for it's durability - and still is.  I've dropped it hundreds of times, many times from several feet, and most every time landing on cement - or boulders - once even a campfire, landing any way you could imagine ... Hardly a dent to show for it.  Screen is still perfectly fine.  I've never had a problem with call quality - don't understand the reviewers gripe with that.  Everything sounds crystal clear to me - no one has complained about me sounding muffled.  The water-proof feature is nice as well - being in Portland Oregon where it's always raining - and spending a LOT of time outdoors in the woods - this phone has seen a lot & is still going strong enough to keep the legacy healthy.  My one gripe with it is what it actually is - a SMART phone.  Because it seems to be more like a regular phone that just happens to do things a smart phone is capable of.  I've had issues with it randomly rebooting as many others have as well - but it's a minor inconvenience.  I am the person this phone is targeted at - people who love to be outdoors & don't care TOO much about apps & processing speed & whatnot. msjkwinter Mine got to the point where it was shutting down at least once a day. I took it into a Verizon store and they sent me a new one!... I was surprised. I actually brought it in twice. The first time the guy told me it was out of warranty (which I already knew that it was). I was in the store a few days later for something else and decided to ask again. She looked up my account and said, "no problem, it's still under warranty." ??? I didn't ask any questions. I just took the new phone. The new one still shuts down occasionally, but so far not bad. The main problem I'm having now is, the GPS sucks!! It takes forever to find my location, or most of the time it never does. Or, in the middle of driving somewhere, it says GPS signal has been lost. Now, I'm not out in the middle of nowhere, mind you. My previous one (the one that shut down all the time) NEVER had a problem with finding our location and never dropped the GPS signal. Any ideas about the GPS problem? Thanks Mike The gave me a runaround for the same problem.... What did you SAY exactly? Duh I submerged mine into a pool about 30 inches down and for about 5 seconds and now the speaker for phone calls is super quiet. Everything else works fine. Overall sweet phone. Brad I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!Its not the fastest but i bought this phone for the durability of the device and i have dropped it and exposed it to water SEVERAL times!!!! WORKS PERFECTLY! So if you need a phone to withstand the elements you make your phone go through each day this is the one you must buy!! Horribel The phones durability is the only thing it has going for it. Add Verizon to the picture and the phone is absolutely horrible, freezes, crashes, keypad partially missing, each and every update brings a whole new set of problems. Chad This phone is the bain of my existance...trying to respond to texts and emails is a nightmare, Facebook does not sync with contacts, and the battery life is crap. Avoid this brick of a device....would almost rather own a flip phone. BGF I like the idea of a ruggedized phone but the bloatware on this thing is enough to drive you crazy. These huge applications, like the compass, tides, sunrise/sunset, etc., etc., etc. eat up huge chunks of space on the phone and slow the entire thing down to the point that it locks up on me, requiring the batter to have to be removed and replaced. If I could get rid of the bloatware, without voiding warranty on it, I would, and would likely be a lot happier with the phone itself. Unfortunately, I cannot get rid of it without rooting the phone. Mark Tough is an understatement. Our plumber drove over it with his service truck. Picked it up and called for his next destination commando sucks This is my third commando and they all absolutely SUCK! NO reception, dropped calls, automatically calling people fron call list. Verizon told me if may be my profile, they looked into it, it wasn't, it was the phone. P.s. it freezes whenever it feels like. P.O.S. PHONE, HATE IT!!! Scott Zimmerman I was finally due for an upgrade my wife had an I phone 4s or the last year I gave her the upgrade for a 5c I took the 4s and I will never miss the commando I am not an Apple fan but it does far better than the crapmanndo and an otter box helps it toughen up just no swimming for this one LOL later Casio never again! the Bolder and the Commando were both a pain Skyler Ok. I've had this phone for a year. It was my first smartphone, so I was excited. Man, was I wrong! This phone has been the worst phone I've ever had. First off, it has a TON of unnecessary stock apps. Apps I will never use... Then there's the simple functions that ANY phone -whether smart or basic- should be able to do, the Commando fails to do a majority of the time. From making calls to sending texts, a common window to pop up is "This app/function has unexpectedly stopped." I've even had to force close the home screen! Should that function be a priority for smartphones?? Not only that, but my Commando has these "restarting episodes." I don't know if any other person's Commando does this, but mine will start restarting and do it as much as 8 or 9 times. Still more, the touch screen? Ha! The thing only responds half of the time! And when I want to text someone or check an email while in bed, the touchscreen acts like there's nothing touching it even though I'm practically jabbing the thing trying to get it to work! Conclusion? This phone is good for someone who wants a rugged phone that can take a beating. Just be ready to face the consequences of having a mediocre "smart" phone that cannot live up to the standards set by Samsung, Apple, or Droid. Its sad I have another year until my next upgrade. conholeo Had for a long time but now it goes from a full charge to dead when I open the browser. This has happened twice already. After it dies it tries to reboot but never gets past the stone logo. Oscar García Do you remember when the rugged ones were hard to find? Hahaha… now that i have seen the agm models online i think its more affordable to have a ruggerized one and i m happy for that :O !

According to Synergy, in Q1 2017, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Alibaba and Oracle all achieved growth rates that were “substantially higher than that of AWS” but AWS revenues are “comfortably bigger than the other five combined.” Microsoft, Google and Alibaba achieved annual growth rates exceeding 80 percent, while niche cloud providers like Rackspace and Salesforce have lower growth rates but maintain strong positions in their respective markets. This week Rackspace rolled out professional services for AWS cloud. AWS reported quarterly “revenue of $3.66 billion, slightly topping estimates and reflecting 42.6 percent growth, and operating income of $890 million,” according to MarketWatch. Microsoft performed slightly better than expected, with revenue of $23.6 billion, versus $23.62 billion that was expected in the quarter. Alphabet includes its cloud business revenues in “other revenues” – in this quarter alone, according to Quartz, Google generated $3 billion in other revenues, an increase of 50 percent over the same quarter the year before.  ​ “At the top end of the cloud provider market we’re now seeing a clear stratification featuring AWS, a group of higher-growth chasers, and a couple of more focused niche players,” John Dinsdale, a Chief Analyst and Research Director at Synergy Research Group said in a statement. “Beyond those leading companies, the cloud market features a long tail of small-to-medium sized providers or companies that have only a minor position in the market, typically based on either a specific country or focused application area. There are decent growth opportunities for some of these smaller players, but they are unlikely to make much impact in terms of overall worldwide market share.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 0 Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your Talkin' Cloud ID Email: Your comment: * Advertisement Related Articles Rackspace (RAX) Q2 2013 Results: AWS Can't Kill Us 1 TeleQuality Communications: Telcos Can't Ignore Healthcare Sector SaaS CRM: Can Channel Partners Still Plug In?

PHOTO: REUTERS A Lithuanian scammer managed to defraud internet giants Facebook and Google of $100 million over a span of two years, according to an indictment by the US Department of Justice. Evaldas Rimasauskas was arrested in March by authorities in Lithuania and was charged with orchestrating a fraudulent business email compromise scheme that induced two US-based internet companies to wire a total of over $100 million to his bank accounts. Scammer tricks 2 big US tech companies into paying him $100 million Names of the two tech companies remained anonymous throughout the case. However, an investigation by Fortune which involved interviews with sources close to law enforcement and other figures found Facebook and Google to be among the three companies targeted in the massive scam. The tech giants were apparently tricked into wiring the amount to two bank accounts in Latvia and Cyprus. Once transferred, the stolen money was routed quickly through different bank accounts in various locations throughout the world, including Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary and Hong Kong. Beware of this latest WhatsApp scam Rimasauskas was charged with one count of wire fraud and three counts of money laundering and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count. The scammer has also been charged with one count of aggravated identity theft which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison. The scam highlights how phishing techniques by cyber criminals have evolved to become convincing enough and trick even the most sophisticated tech companies in the world. “This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies – even the most sophisticated – that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cyber criminals,” said acting US Attorney Joon H Kim during the hearing of the case.

As the US under President Donald Trump turns more protectionist, telecom czar Sunil Bharti Mittal today asked if India should say no to Facebook and Google just because it has similar homegrown apps. Not overly concerned about protectionism as his business is "rooted in the domestic market", Mittal highlighted that it is unfair that movement of Indian workers gets restricted, while foreign firms make huge profits in India. "If you come to a situation where skilled workers which actually drive your economy back home are going to be denied (entry) or Indian companies are forced to pay a particular salary just to become uncompetitive in those countries, I think that becomes an affirmative action against the companies that want to do trade there," he said. He was responding to a question on how he would react if Bharti Airtel was not allowed to operate in certain geographies. Citing examples of tech firms like Google, Facebook and WhatsApp that have millions of users in India, Mittal questioned if these companies should be allowed to operate in India even as similar homegrown apps are already there in the country. "You can't have (a situation) that on one hand and you have 200 million customers on Facebook, 150 million on WhatsApp, 100 million people on Google... Would we say we don't want FaceBook (and) Google to operate in India, we have homegrown apps," the Bharti Airtel Chairman said. Mittal said India is a big market for technology companies given the huge consumer base. Over the past few weeks, countries like the US, Singapore and Australia have taken steps to tighten their work visa norms. This could potentially impact the operating costs for Indian IT companies that send employees to work on client sites using visas.

Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images Technology sector Fangs: the lightning rise of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google The tech giants have ballooned in value by $250bn since January - double the value of all the gold mined in a year - in four months Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Alex Hern and Nick Fletcher Saturday 29 April 2017 04.00 EDT From Standard Oil at the turn of the 20th century to IBM and General Motors in the 1970s and General Electric in the 1990s, the US has always produced behemoth corporations that bestride the world. But this is the era of the Fangs, the “big four” of technology, and they are currently growing at breakneck speed. Facebook, Amazon, Neflix and Google have been roaring away since the turn of this year. Their share prices have climbed so far, so fast, that together they are now worth an extraordinary $250bn more than just four months ago. To put that sum into perspective, compare it to the value of all the gold mined in the world in a year , which is worth about $115bn. Or look at it another way - $250bn is about the same as the annual GDP of countries such as Venezuela, Pakistan and Ireland. Together the four firms are now valued on Wall Street at more than $1.5tn, about the same as the Russian economy. The Fang acronym is not new - it was first coined four years ago by US finance expert and broadcaster Jim Cramer – but the rocket behind their share prices is now making it mainstream. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Space race: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos inside a Blue Origin ‘rocket’. Bezos hopes to beat Tesla boss Elon Musk in a race to reach Mars. Photograph: Isaiah Downing/Reuters In fact, it is now slightly out of date, because Google rebranded itself as Alphabet last year, so it should technically be “Fana”. There is, however, one thing no one can argue with. Their share prices, boosted further by positive financial results this week, have delivered huge multibillion-dollar boosts to the personal fortunes of their founders, all of whom still run the companies they dreamed up. Amazon, which beat forecasts with first-quarter sales of $36bn, has increased in value by $80bn since the start of 2017 to $440bn, meaning the near-17% stake held by Jeff Bezos is now worth $13.5bn more than it was in January. His total wealth now stands at $74bn. Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, is now on the brink of toppling the legendary investor Warren Buffett to become the world’s second-richest person after Bill Gates. Both men are spending their money fast, Gates on fighting malaria and other treatable diseases in the developing world, and Bezos on building his own spaceflight company, Blue Origin, with the aim of beating the Tesla boss Elon Musk to Mars. Facebook, which reports ist results next week, has grown in value by $92bn to $424bn this year. Its founder Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune has increased alongside the share price by $13bn to around $60bn. He owns only about 14% of the quoted shares, but under an unusual voting structure he controls more than 50% of the company. Alphabet is the gorilla in this room of big beasts. It is now valued at $610bn, up $68bn since the end of December. Its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, each own around 7% each. Their combined stake is worth about $85bn, up $8.5bn since the start of year. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Netflix is seen as the smallest of the Fangs, but is growing fast. Photograph: Dan Goodman/AP The relative minnow is Netflix, which has climbed in value by $12.5bn since January to $66bn, or three times the value of Sky TV. Reed Hastings, its co-founder and current chief executive, has seen his 1.43% shareholding rise in value by $180m to $944m. Thomas Husson at the tech research group Forrestersays Netflix has far to go. “Not only have they reached 100m subscribers, they have managed to create a digital relationship with their customers. They know their preferences and are good at acting on the insights they collect on their customers. They are growing fast and are very disruptive.” What lies behind the astronomical increase in value of the Fangs? To a certain extent, they’ve been buoyed by the same tide that raised US shares to record highs this year, the election of Donald Trump. The new president may threaten trade wars and real wars, and prompt unheard-of levels of domestic unrest, but to Wall Street investors, all that pales in comparison to a couple of policy proposals that have been on the cards since the day he won the Republican nomination - lower corporation taxes and a tax holiday on repatriated cash. The US has one of the highest levels of corporation tax in the world, up to 35% with some states charging more on top. For internationally competitive companies, that creates a strong motivation to not bring income earned overseas back to the US. The Fangs have huge international earnings. One proposed solution, favoured by the Republican party for decades and periodically enacted, is a repatriation tax holiday - a fixed period during which money brought onshore is taxed less. The last holiday in 2004 led to $362bn being brought back to the US at a reduced tax rate of 5.25%. Paradoxically, each tax holiday increases the need for the next, because companies start holding ever greater amounts of their tax offshore in the expectation that the next Republican government will announce a new one. In the expectation of just that, which would allow a flood of onshored income to boost dividend payouts and share buybacks, investors have been buying up stocks in companies with foreign holdings. But the Fangs also have their own unique benefits. In a tech industry with a globalised supply chain fighting anti-globalisation movements, where businesses are finding it tough to provide big improvements on devices from laptops to smartphones, and where the next big thing keeps failing to take off they sell nothing but binary code sent over the net.

Facebook and Google are primarily advertising companies. One sells things to you while you’re looking for information, the other while you’re chatting to friends. They’re also both in the business of user-generated content, encouraging their customers to upload fun, shareable videos to YouTube and Facebook so they have something to put advertising against – and keep you coming back for more. In the content industry, the two also compete against Netflix and Amazon, which both produce web video far more directly, with millions invested in the creation of high-quality long-form drama and comedy. Amazon competes against Google in the shopping business, because more and more of us skip the middleman when we want to buy something. And then there are the enormously profitable back-ends. Amazon Web Services makes more profit selling cloud computing services to other companies than it does selling things to you or I, and Google Cloud makes almost as much money doing the same thing to its own startups. None of Fangs have reached the astronomical levels of profitability seen at Apple, which has mastered the art of building expensive technology and selling it for eye-watering levels of profit. Apple, however, also has a weakness. When it comes to its revenue, it has only one really huge product: the iPhone. The Fangs, by contrast, are diversified. They can sell their stuff wherever there is internet access, they don’t have to worry about pesky supply chain issues and they’re aiming for the top of the pile.
