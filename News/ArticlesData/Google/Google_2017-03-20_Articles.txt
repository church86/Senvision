As hackers get more aggressive and more sites become outdated, hackers will continue to capitalise by infecting more sites,” Google said in a post on its webmaster blog. Google, which inserts security warnings when it detects hacked sites, said most of those warned can clean up their pages, but that 61 per cent are not notified because their sites are not verified by the search engine. “As always, it’s best to take a preventative approach and secure your site rather than dealing with the aftermath,” the blog said. “Remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.” The news comes amid growing concerns over cybersecurity in the wake of massive hacks affecting Yahoo, the US government and major e-commerce firms. Google said certain website hacks often follow similar patterns — some insert “gibberish” on a page, while others create Japanese text that links to fake brand merchandise sites. “Hacking behaviour is constantly evolving, and research allows us to stay up to date on and combat the latest trends,” Google said. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Smartphone device can test sperm quality Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Montblanc just launched a smartwatch — here’s why it matters China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Google allows users to share their locations in mapping app Google expands news feature on News and Weather app Google rai hari lahir P Ramlee, kenang insan pelbagai bakat Google to revamp ad policies after UK, big brands boycott Five-star reviews flood ‘Hotline Jais’ app after claim it will be removed Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Ivor Bennett reports ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript For companies like Marks and Spencer, YouTube is a vital advertising platform. But it's not one it'll be using anytime soon. The British retailer is the latest company to pull its advertising from Google's platforms after other firms' campaigns appeared alongside videos carrying extremist content. Speaking at an advertising conference in London, Google's European chief made this apology. SOUNDBITE (English) MATT BRITTIN, EMEA PRESIDENT, GOOGLE, SAYING: "So I want to start by saying sorry. You know, we apologise. When anything like that happens, we don't want it to happen, you don't want it to happen, and we take responsibility for it." The problem is, it was happening quite a lot. L'Oreal's campaign with actress Helen Mirren was the first to be noticed. The Times newspaper reporting it appeared alongside preaching videos by Steven Anderson. The American pastor who notoriously praised the shooting spree at a gay nightclub in Florida last year. This Guardian advert was spotted on a post by far-right group Britain First. While the videos of former KKK leader David Duke reportedly carried advertising by the Royal Navy. For every 1000 clicks an advert generates, around 6 pounds goes to the video's host meaning the brands were effectively financing extremists. SOUNDBITE (English) MATT BRITTIN, EMEA PRESIDENT, GOOGLE, SAYING: "In general what we've found is that it's been a handful of impressions and pennies not pounds. But however small or big the issue, we need to improve and we need to get better." The company's said it's reviewing its policy on video monetisation to more clearly define inflammatory content, and simplify the controls advertisers can have on where their material appears.

By Avi Salzman March 20, 2017 5:44 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Google is struggling to reassure European companies that their ads won’t be placed next to questionable content. Photo: Getty Images Google and its video platform YouTube have come under fire in recent weeks for running ads against extremist content. Now one analyst thinks the controversy could slow the company’s growth. More from Barron’s Next How Facebook’s ‘Fake News’ Solution Insulates Investors Can Investors Still Trust Facebook? Twitter’s Plan for Online Abuse? Ignorance is Bliss Havas, a major European marketing firm, recently said it would pull its clients’ ads from YouTube and the Google Display Network in the U.K. after ads began running next to “questionable” content, including videos supporting terrorism. Other companies, including the BBC and the U.K. government, have also removed their ads. Havas told reporters that Google was “unable to provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly enough or with the correct filters.” This comes after Google came under fire when its highest-grossing YouTube entertainer included Nazi imagery on his videos. After the Wall Street Journal made inquiries, Google pulled ads off of the videos but left the content up. Matt Brittin, Google’s European head, apologized at an advertising conference on Monday and said the company would improve ad placement. But he declined to say whether Google would actively look for extremist content, instead of waiting for users to flag it, according to The Guardian. Google also put up a blog post on the controversy. It may not quell the controversy: A British politician has said Google is “profiting from hatred.” One analyst thinks the issue could hurt Google-parent Alphabet’s stock. Pivotal Research’s Brian Wieser wrote in a note on Monday that the controversy will “curtail global growth this year.” He reduced his rating on Alphabet share to Hold from Buy and lowered his price target to $950 from $970. The stock closed at $867.50 on Monday. “While Google has apologized for the incidents, and while the scale of the underlying problem may be relatively small in absolute terms, for large marketers, any one instance of an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm a brand’s business value,” he wrote. These types of issues are not exclusive to Google. Facebook and Twitter face their own questions about user-generated content.

Issuing a token apology, he says the money Google paid to neo-Nazis and terror sympathisers amounted to ‘pennies not pounds’, the pages were viewed a ‘handful of times’ and its monitoring works ‘most of the time’. Well that’s alright then! For Google’s former clients, who pulled ads after unwittingly sponsoring extremist material, his words will ring hollow. Reeking of complacency, the head of Google’s European operations, Matt Brittin, tries desperately to downplay the scandal of advertising appearing alongside sickening hate videos on YouTube So too will his defence that it is too hard to monitor the 400 hours of videos uploaded every minute. In truth, Google – which for years has shamefully ignored complaints about poisonous content – isn’t interested. Its belated and lacklustre response is simply an attempt to protect its bottom line. And despite UK revenues of £6billion, it relies on the public to flag up hate videos instead of hiring an army of monitors. The Mail is entirely confident that neither company bosses nor ministers will be satisfied with its response. Much-needed regulation must surely follow. Only then, perhaps, will the message get home to arrogant, tax-avoiding Google that it urgently needs to clean up its act. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next ALEX BRUMMER: We should not be too surprised that Sir Martin... Google's Head of Europe apologises for ads on extremist... Share this article Share Don’t skew justice It should go without saying that victims of the heinous crime of rape deserve our every sympathy, and their cases merit the most determined effort by police and prosecutors. But it is equally true that the justice system must never be skewed one way or the other. That, the Mail fears, will be the consequence of the decision by Liz Truss, the Lord Chancellor, to allow accusers to pre-record their evidence on video. Now senior lawyers are queuing up to warn that the move would be unfair to defendants. By preventing live cross-examination in court, Miss Truss limits the jury’s ability to judge – from body language and tone of voice – whether they believe the alleged victim. Yes, giving evidence in advance may make the experience of court less harrowing for victims. But that is no justification for tilting the scales of justice unfairly in one direction. A date with history At last! Now we can put the date in our diaries. In eight days, Theresa May will trigger Article 50. Come what may, on March 29, 2019 Britain will have left the EU. The Mail confidently believes taking this historic step to free ourselves from the shackles of the sclerotic Brussels bureaucracy will open up a great future. At last! Now we can put the date in our diaries. In eight days, Theresa May will trigger Article 50. Come what may, on March 29, 2019 Britain will have left the EU Yes, the talks may be hard, but with the economy – touch wood – still buoyant, we enter them from a position of strength. With her upbeat approach – and by declaring Britain wants to remain Europe’s ‘best friend and neighbour’ while making clear we will walk away from a bad deal – Mrs May is setting just the right tone. Meanwhile, that deluded Eurocrat Jean- Claude Juncker threatens to make an ‘example’ of us and impose a £50billion divorce bill to dissuade others from leaving. But don’t such comments, and his insistence that remaining member states will ‘fall in love with each other again and renew their vows with the EU’, betray nothing but weakness and fear?   After excelling itself with impartial coverage during the referendum campaign, the BBC has reverted to type. Its EU coverage is unremittingly gloomy and, as MPs argue today, dominated by ‘regretful Remainers’.  Is it too much to hope that, once Article 50 is triggered, the BBC will stop painting such a relentlessly negative picture of Brexit Britain?

Nest Dropcams Can Be Taken Down via Bluetooth Vulnerabilities GO Three vulnerabilities were found in Nest firmware Mar 21, 2017 01:36 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Nest's security cameras, the Dropcam and Dropcam Pro, can be wirelessly attacked via Bluetooth and Google has done nothing about this yet.  Discovered by security researcher Jason Doyle a few months back, there are three vulnerabilities in the camera firmware version 5.2.1 which allows them to crash and stop recording footage with the help of Bluetooth. This, of course, is just perfect for all those burglars facing the "inconvenience" of breaking into a Nest "protected" home. Doyle warned Google about the problem back in October, but there's been no software update thus far, which pushed Doyle to go public with the details of the flaws. Perhaps now Google will finally do something about this problem since it has a track record of fixing vulnerabilities before they are made public. As mentioned, there are several bugs. For the first one, an attacker can trigger a buffer overflow in the camera by pinging it an overlong Wi-Fi SSID parameter via Bluetooth Low Energy, which causes the gadget to crash and reboot. The second vulnerability discovered in the Nest firmware is similar, but this time the criminal can send a long Wi-Fi password parameter to the camera which will have the same effect - crash and restart. The third and final vulnerability Doyle discovered can allow the crook to send the camera a new Wi-Fi SSID to connect to, which forces it to disconnect from the current network. The camera then tries to join the new SSID which doesn't exist, and reconnect to the previous wireless network about a minute and a half later. During this time, the device stops recording any type of footage to its backend. This means the camera can be rendered useless since it can be knocked offline repeatedly. The worst part is that all an attacker needs, on top of some IT knowledge, is to be in BLE range. Since this is someone who is likely trying to break into your house, that shouldn't be a problem, though. Bluetooth, integral to Nest cams There may be a reason why Google hasn't fixed these problems yet, and that's because Bluetooth is a part of the cameras. It is enabled by default and stays on at all times so the devices can be reconfigured at any time. This, unfortunately, leaves them vulnerable to attacks. Unless Google makes Nest turn off Bluetooth after setup, this will continue to be a problem. At the very least, it could offer users a way to shut down Bluetooth if they wanted to. The Register reports, however, that Google does have a patch prepared and will push it shortly, although no timeline was provided for this. #Nest#Nest Dropcam#bluetooth#vulnerability#Jason Doyle subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google's Ad Business Is Shaking Due to Ads Placed Next to Terrorist & Nazi Vids Judge Wants Google to Tell Cops Everyone Who Googled One Man's Name Google Says Number of Hacked Sites Grew by 32% in 2016 Google Celebrates the Equinox with Two Doodles for the Changing Seasons Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows    The Nest Dropcams have a big problem Related Apps SCV Cryptomanager: A handy application that helps you generate various encryption for your files, using powerful algorithms, such as RSA, SHA, MD5 or Blowfish Crypt-O: Efficiently create and manage secure and custom databases with the help of this comprehensive and straightforward software solution Kerio Control: A powerful solution that was especially created in order to offer an impenetrable security layer for the protection of any networks east-tec Eraser: Protect your privacy by securely wiping confidential documents and removing traces left behind by other applications with this intuitive tool LastPass: The last password you'll have to remember - a web browser plugin for storing all user accounts in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari Emsisoft Decrypter Tools: Seamlessly clean your computer of some of the most common ransomware that can get into your computer and lock it with these tools MeeboPasswordDecryptor: Recover lost or forgotten passwords from the Meebo instant messenger with the help of this fast and easy-to-use software program Reader comments Cerber Ransomware Gets Pushed in Blank Slate Campaign more on: Cerber i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

In another day of shame for the technology giant, it tried to downplay the impact of adverts placed alongside extremist videos on its YouTube website – which make money for their creators. And in a move which angered MPs, Google repeatedly refused to say whether it would actively root out vile content. Matt Brittin, the firm’s European boss, told a London advertising conference yesterday: ‘I want to start by saying sorry. We apologise when anything like that happens. We don’t want it to happen and you don’t want it to happen, and we take responsibility for it.’ But he added: ‘I’ve spoken to ... some brands that are affected. In general I’ve found that it has been a handful of impressions and pennies not pounds.’ Household names and Government departments have been horrified after an investigation found their adverts running alongside YouTube videos by Islamic State preachers and white supremacists. Google, whose motto is ‘Don’t be evil’, hands a slice of the revenue generated by adverts to the user who posted the content. According to independent marketing experts, extremists have made around £250,000 from advertising on YouTube. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Google's Head of Europe apologises for ads on extremist... Now M&S boycotts Google: Web giant faces growing storm of... Share this article Share The notorious Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghoneim’s YouTube channel has raised £63,500 after being watched 31million times. MPs reacted furiously to Mr Brittin’s mealy-mouthed mea culpa, saying: ‘This apology from Google doesn’t go far enough.’ Yvette Cooper, Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘They still don’t seem to have woken up to the seriousness and toxicity of some of the videos they are still hosting and their own responsibility to deal with that. They need to say whether they will be paying back any of that advertising revenue, and to answer our questions on what more they are doing to root out extremism or illegal activity. The notorious Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghoneim’s YouTube channel (pictured) has raised £63,500 after being watched 31million times The huge sums earned and spent by Google, now one of the world's largest companies  ‘It isn’t enough for Google to respond only when their advertising revenues take a hit. ‘They are one of the biggest and most powerful companies on the planet. They can afford to do far more, far faster.’ The advertisers’ trade body, ISBA, agreed that Google’s apology fell short, saying: ‘Let us be clear, it has not gone far enough. ‘Whatever Google’s editorial policy, advertising should only be sold against content that is safe for brands and if it is serious about tackling this it needs to increase its enforcement and support capabilities urgently.’ It added that Google should stop selling advertising space on YouTube until it can guarantee brands that it is ‘safe’. Meanwhile, Google bosses yesterday tied themselves in knots to dodge questions about whether the firm will pay staff to actively look for offensive videos. Executive Peter Barron admitted last week that the web giant does not employ a single person to root out hate speech on YouTube. But yesterday Mr Brittin refused to confirm this, or to say whether Google would consider hiring staff to look for extreme content. Yvette Cooper, Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, said Google hasn't grasped the toxicity of some of the videos In a farcical episode at the AdWeek Europe conference, he ducked the question four times – either ignoring it or changing the subject. He said three times that Google was reviewing its policies, the ‘controls’ it gives to advertisers and its ‘enforcement’ practices. But he stubbornly refused to say whether this might include staff to proactively find hate videos. Currently, users can flag inappropriate content themselves. Google bosses have already been hauled into the Cabinet Office and given a dressing down over the scandal. The firm places adverts using computer algorithms rather than human judgment. Users posting videos on the site take a cut of revenue worth up to £6.15 for every 1,000 views. Pressure on Google grew last night as Go Ape, which runs assault courses, became the latest brand to boycott YouTube adverts. In all, more than 250 firms have blocked advertising with Google, including Volkswagen, Tesco, Toyota, Heinz and ITV, which all announced suspensions yesterday. They followed Marks & Spencer, Channel 4, HSBC, Lloyds, RBS, McDonald’s, L’Oreal, Audi, the BBC, O2, Royal Mail and Domino’s. The Government has also suspended its YouTube adverts. Lord Best, chairman of the Lords’ communications committee, said he believed Google had the technology to banish hate speech from its platform if it wanted to. n Google and Facebook should be forced to apply the strictest privacy controls and age settings as default, peers have claimed. The technology giants have been ‘dragging their feet’ over child controls, and should be forced to sign up to a code of conduct, the House of Lords’ communications committee said. This would make child-friendly content filters standard, and stop the firms gathering information about users’ locations without permission.   Experts insist ads on hate videos could have earned £5,000 By TOM KELLY FOR THE DAILY MAIL Google insists advertisers only hand extremists ‘pennies’ for their videos. But some hate-filled posts are believed to have raked in thousands of pounds, according to online marketing experts. The person who posted one virulently anti-semitic video accusing Jews of slaughtering American children could have pocketed over £5,000, with the internet giant also making almost as much itself. Google typically pays up to about £6.15 for every 1,000 views an advert attracts on its video-sharing website YouTube, although it said the figure is often lower. The company also takes a cut, although it said the ‘majority’ of the advertising revenue goes to the video maker. Google executive Matt Brittin said that in most cases the sums involved were ‘pennies not pounds’. However the video, called Blood sacrifice for McDonald’s, received 915,000 views before it was removed, according to The Times. This would have made it over £5,600 if it was receiving the top rate of advertising revenue. The post features a hoax ‘rabbi’ revelling in a description of how Jews kill American children as a sacrifice and sell their carcases to be made into burgers. Other copies of the video were still on the site yesterday with thousands of hits. In a grim irony, one version of the video which had 273,724 views, had an embedded advert for www.vizeat.com, which describes itself as the ‘favourite website of gourmet travellers’. Other extremists posting on YouTube have also have massive followings which are likely to bring in far more than ‘pennies’. Videos posted by David Duke, the US white nationalist, anti-semitic conspiracy theorist, and former Imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, have been viewed 100,000 times. YouTube announced in 2007 that it would start paying a slice of advertising revenue to people who posted on the site. Many respectable video bloggers have cashed in, with beauty blogger Zoella, real name Zoe Sugg, earning a reported £50,000 a month from her 11.6million YouTube followers. Mr Brittin apologised for the extremist videos but, having spoken to advertisers, did not believe the sums were large. ‘Those that I have spoken to, by the way, we have been talking about a handful of impressions and pennies not pounds of spend — that’s in the case of the ones I’ve spoken to at least,’ he said. ‘However small or big the issue, it’s an important issue that we address.’ Share or comment on this article e-mail 29 shares Most watched News videos Shocking moment terror attacker's car speeds across bridge Dramatic video shows horror of aftermath on Westminster Bridge Terrified public flee as three shots ring out in Parliament Square Commotion outside Parliament as police react after attack Injured people lay stricken on Westminster Bridge after attack Horrifying car crash scene shows victim at Parliament railings 'Go! go!'

Post Staff SEE ALSO Ad firm pulls spots from YouTube over proximity to white supremacist videos 0:0 Madison Avenue is finally putting the screws to ad-selling tech... Google boss Larry Page is beginning to sweat. The search giant, its massive global ad machine under attack, apologized on Monday for allowing clients’ marketing efforts to appear on inappropriate YouTube videos. “This is a good opportunity for me to say sorry, this should not have happened, and we need to do better,” Matt Brittin, Google’s head of business and operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said at an advertising conference in the UK. Google’s ad sales, expected to grow 16 percent this year, to $28.6 billion, have come under pressure in recent days after it was learned that ads for a number of large brands appeared on videos by controversial Muslim preacher Wagdy Ghoneim, white nationalist David Duke and terrorist support groups. Several large advertisers said YouTube parent Google had better police the matter or they will pull their advertising dollars. WPP Group executive vice president of brand safety John Montgomery told The Post that major advertisers are on “high alert” after learning of the brand safety issue. One ad holding company, Havas, yanked all its clients from YouTube UK as a result. “We want them to do more, to use their considerable technical and financial expertise, to fix the problem … clients have a limited tolerance for risk,” Montgomery told The Post. Google’s robust digital ad revenue growth has it gobbling up 78 percent of total US search ad revenue, according to eMarketer. Display ads are another $5 billion business for Google. On Monday, Wall Street analyst Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research downgraded Google parent Alphabet to hold on fears it might face some pressure on ad revenue. Wieser wrote that Google’s comment Friday that it couldn’t guarantee that any ad is classified quickly enough or with the correct filters “is a big deal.” “Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero tolerance policy, to alleviate concerns, before it can fully recover,” Wieser said. Alphabet shares slipped $3.72 on Monday, to close at $848.40. Some advertisers create white lists to protect where their ads appear online, one digital ad executive told The Post. “The Google exchanges let just about anyone on,” said a person with knowledge of the automated ad business. Google said it has been reviewing its ad placement procedures but will now accelerate that process. Some argue that Google doesn’t want to wade into free-speech issues that put its profits at risk. But that did not sit well with one advertising insider. “Barnes & Noble isn’t going to put hard-core porn next to Proust. Free speech is a convenient cover. There’s a profit motive, it’s very expensive and time-consuming.” Some Google rivals note that the firm could hire more data scientists to police their content instead of serving up ads attached to, for instance, jihadists or neo-Nazis running websites.

Google's Ad Business Is Shaking Due to Ads Placed Next to Terrorist & Nazi Vids GO Advertisers are boycotting Google, situation is escalating Mar 21, 2017 01:14 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Google is in deep water with advertisers over badly placed ads. There's currently a wide-scale boycott against the company.  Following reports that ads were appearing on YouTube videos from terrorists and hate-mongers, ad companies started pulling their content. Numerous British brands and governmental groups halted their collaboration with Google, amounting to many, many millions in business. This past weekend, several other companies have joined the boycott, including Lloyds, the Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, three of the largest British banks. In a sudden reminder that Google is mostly an ad-company itself since most of its revenue comes from this one source, Alphabet Inc's stock was downgraded from "buy" to "hold" on Monday due to the scandal. During trading hours, Alphabet's stock didn't seem to be too affected by the change or the scandal, but if things continue, chances are the prices will start dropping. "We think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem," wrote ad industry analyst Brian Wieser. "Sorry" doesn't cut it The problem, as mentioned, is that Google has automated its entire process. Given the size of the company and the size of the business it runs, it makes sense. What does not make sense is the lack of some type of filtering. Ads for major brands were being placed on videos of David Duke, the former KKK leader, homophobic preachers praising the Orlando nightclub shooting, Islamic State sympathizers, and so on. While this was mostly noticed in the UK, the problem may be a bit more global. In fact, Google's chief of European operations, Matt Brittin, admitted during a conference held on Monday that there was a global scope to the issue. Google also conceded this was a problem and that they were to blame, offering apologies. The problem is that in instances such as this one, people want results, not excuses. #Google#Google ads#YouTube#boycott subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Judge Wants Google to Tell Cops Everyone Who Googled One Man's Name Google Celebrates the Equinox with Two Doodles for the Changing Seasons Uber President Jeff Jones Quits, Joins Long List of Departing Execs YouTube Says Restricted Mode Blocks Mature Content, Not LGBTQ+ Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows    Google is having some troubles with its main money-making business Related Apps PB for Desktop: Access the Pushbullet web app's full potential directly from your computer's desktop and without having to rely on a web browser with the help of this lightweight, unofficial client RipMe: Download image and video albums from numerous popular media hosting websites easily, with this lightweight Java-based application ORBADA: Access and manage all sort of databases including Oracle, SQLite, Firebird, HSQLDB, DerbyDB, MySQL and others, using this neat application Kerio Connect: A handy, comprehensive and easy-to-use server that enables companies to collaborate via email, shared contacts, shared calendars and tasks Family Tree Analyzer: Load a GEDCOM file and display some basic reports regarding individuals, families, locations, occupations, data errors and loose deaths Evaer: Record conversations from Skype and save them on your computer in a simple manner with this comprehensive and easy to use application GSA Content Generator: Effortlessly scrape data from any webpage and generate comprehensive content for your articles with the help of this efficient application Reader comments YouTube on Restricted Mode Blocking LGBTQ+ Content: Our System Is Flawed more on: YouTube i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

This brings devices up to Android 7.1.2 and brings a few minor changes to the Pixel, while Nexus devices and the Pixel C are seeing larger changes. Image courtesy of Android Police The big change for the Pixel C comes to the launcher. Google has packaged an all-new launcher with the update, while also bringing the on-screen nav buttons that were introduced with the Pixel and Pixel XL. The Pixel C launcher also now matches that of its smaller brethren, with the new icons, folders, and Google Search widget. According to the folks at Android Police, this new launcher is “the real Pixel Launcher, not just something themed to look like it.” It’s important to note that there may be some changes implemented today that may not make it to the final build. But it definitely seems that Google is looking to match the UI across the entire Pixel lineup.

Google to ship Project Soli gesture development kits later this year Project Soli will bring gesture recognition to gaming without touching a smartphone screen Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 17 March, 2017 02:03 0 - - - - print email Google will start shipping development kits for its Project Soli wireless gesture recognition technology later this year. Project Soli involves a millimeter-wave radar chip that can detect "very fine" gestures with fingers and hands. It can then be used for playing games using hand gestures on mobile devices, computers, and electronics. The technology has the potential to get rid of controllers and input devices. Its biggest impact could be in virtual and augmented reality. When using VR headsets, users now need to hold controllers, but Project Soli could allow hand gesture movement to define how a user roams a virtual world. The chip is so tiny that Google has put it in devices as small as smartwatches. It was jointly developed by Google with Infineon, which has said the technology will be jointly marketed by both companies later this year. An announcement about the development kit was made at the recent Game Developer Conference. The goal for the developer kit is to discover new uses for the technology. Initially, Google is targeting Project Soli at game control using hand gestures. A demo showed a user flicking fingers on a device containing the Project Soli chip, and the finger movement controlled a character running on a screen. The quicker the fingers flicked, the faster the character ran. By moving the hand up or down, the character could jump over trees. One group at the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. used the technology to recognize materials based on weight and other characteristics. For example, it could detect copper, plastic, and other materials. Project Soli could be transformative technology and be used in applications beyond gaming, Aaron Cammarata, technical project lead at the Google Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP), said in a video posted on YouTube. The radar technology is highly reliable, and the response is quick because it uses millimeter-wave technology. Google ATAP is leading the projectÂ and works on technology that is then used in commercial products. One of its big flops was Project Ara, a modular smartphone that was scrapped by Google. ATAP also developed Tango, an augmented reality platform that is now part of Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro smartphone.Â Later this year, Levi's will ship clothes with touch and gesture interactivity stitched into the fabric, and that functionality was developed as part of Google ATAP's Project Jacquard.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

"It has to be corrected," Roth told an audience at Advertising Week Europe in London yesterday. "If they don't fix it, they're going to suffer economically, which is the ultimate accountability." His comments followed the actions of media agency Havas, which said on Friday it was stopping spending with Google and Google-owned YouTube because it had failed to receive satisfactory assurances that video and display content would be classified quickly enough and with the correct filters. "They [Google] have to put systems in place that look at placement" of ads, Roth said. "It's incumbent upon them to do it." Several public bodies, media owners and brands have announced in recent days that they were pulling ads from YouTube over concerns these were appearing alongside "inappropriate" content. Roth said Google has assured IPG that it can arrive at a solution to the issue. While the executive declined to say how long IPG is prepared to wait for a resolution, Roth said the advertising group would keep up the pressure on Google. "We're not giving them a free pass," he declared. Speaking in a separate session, Matt Brittin, President for Google EMEA, expressed contrition and said the company planned to review existing controls, policies and enforcement. "Please accept our apologies," he told his audience. "We need to improve and get better." Although Google and YouTube are in the spotlight, it's a wider issue for the industry, Brittin insisted. "It's important we get this right," he added.

As hackers get more aggressive and more sites become outdated, hackers will continue to capitalize by infecting more sites,” Google said in a post on its webmaster blog. ADVERTISEMENT Google, which inserts security warnings when it detects hacked sites, said most of those warned can clean up their pages, but that 61 percent are not notified because their sites are not verified by the search engine. READ: NBI: ‘Hacker’ led victims to fake bank web site “As always, it’s best to take a preventative approach and secure your site rather than dealing with the aftermath,” the blog said. “Remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.” The news comes amid growing concerns over cybersecurity in the wake of massive hacks affecting Yahoo, the US government and major e-commerce firms. Google said certain website hacks often follow similar patterns — some insert “gibberish” on a page, while others create Japanese text that links to fake brand merchandise sites. “Hacking behavior is constantly evolving, and research allows us to stay up to date on and combat the latest trends,” Google said.

You can find it on a Minn. factory floor Business Tasnim Shamma · WABE-FM · Mar 18, 2017 A factory worker in Jackson, Minn., uses Google Glass on the assembly line. Courtesy of AGCO Listen Story audio 3min 56sec Remember Google Glass? They're the headsets that look like regular glasses but have a small computer on the side to speak to and access the Internet. If that's not ringing a bell, it could be because Google Glass fizzled out and was discontinued in the consumer market. But now, it's getting a second life in the manufacturing industry. One of the pioneers of this technology is a company based in suburban Atlanta. AGCO has factories all over the world where it makes large tractors, chemical sprayers and other farm equipment. At one of AGCO's factories, Heather Erickson is putting together a tractor engine before it goes on to the assembly line. She's wearing a red-and-black uniform over her blue jeans at a facility in Jackson, Minn. And she's wearing something else: Google Glass on her head. "It took a little getting used to. But once I got used to it, it's just been awesome," Erickson says. Google Glass tells her what to do should she forget, for example, which part goes where. "I don't have to leave my area to go look at the computer every time I need to look up something," she says. With Google Glass, she scans the serial number on the part she's working on. This brings up manuals, photos or videos she may need. She can tap the side of headset or say "OK Glass" and use voice commands to leave notes for the next shift worker. The headsets are being used in other industries as well. Companies working in the health care, entertainment and energy industries are listed as some of the Google Glass certified partners. And autistic children are using the technology to recognize emotions. Peggy Gullick, business process improvement director with AGCO, says the addition of Google Glass has been "a total game changer." Quality checks are now 20 percent faster, she says, and it's also helpful for on-the-job training of new employees. Before this, workers used tablets. "We had a lot of tablets on our floor, and the tablets were being broken just by being dropped. And tractors are very tall machines when you're climbing on and off," Gullick says. "So we were looking for a solution that offered them more information in a more timely manner." AGCO has about 100 employees using the custom Google Glass, which is attached to them and harder to lose. Each costs about $2,000. Tiffany Tsai, who writes about technology, says it's one of a growing number of companies — including General Electric and Boeing — testing it out. "It was always my assumption that Google Glass was going to go into business for enterprises instead of mass consumer consumption," she says. She was one of the early users of Google Glass when it came out in 2013. Two years later, it was discontinued for some consumers because people were concerned about privacy and security. And there were concerns that the headset could be distracting to drivers or that it wasn't made with all people in mind. Tsai says another reason for it being discontinued was its challenging of social norms: With Google Glass, it may look like you're listening to the person in front of you, but you could actually be watching a movie or looking up sports stats. You could be in a different world. "On Google Glass, [another person] has no idea what's happening, does not see anything that the user is looking at or analyzing," Tsai says. "And that creates this disconnect between people, and I think that that's highly frowned upon right now, especially with older generations." Millennials may be more open to it in the future, but Google Glass still has a long way to go until it's considered more socially acceptable, she says. But at AGCO's factories, it's not only accepted; it's desired. Gullick says the company plans to double the number in use by the end of the year. WABE host Jim Burress contributed to this report.

Google is facing a growing advertiser boycott in the UK. Image: david paul morris/Getty Images By Patrick Kulp2017-03-21 00:38:20 UTC Google now has a full-scale advertiser revolt on its hands. A host of British brands and governmental groups pulled their business from the search giant's platform last week after reports showed that ads were surfacing on YouTube videos from terrorists and hate-mongers. Several more joined in over the weekend, including three of the UK's largest banks — HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Lloyds — and British department store Marks & Spencer. SEE ALSO: Google swears ads will stop showing up in the absolute worst places The crisis was enough to prompt ad industry analyst Brian Wieser to downgrade parent company Alphabet's stock from "buy" to "hold" on Monday. He warned that the backlash has the potential to spill out from the UK to the rest of the world.  "We think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem," Wieser wrote in a research note from his firm, Pivotal Research. As of Monday afternoon, Alphabet stock was only down around a half a percent after trading at an all-time-high price in recent days. The Royal Bank of Scotland isn't too keen on advertising on offensive videos. Image: AP/REX/Shutterstock The ads in question were first uncovered through a series of investigations by The Times of London and The Guardian in recent weeks. The papers found that Google's automated systems were placing ads for major brands on videos of former KKK leader David Duke, Islamic State sympathizers and a homophobic preacher who praised the Orlando nightclub shooting, among other controversial content.  It's unclear whether these mistakes are more common in the UK, or that's simply where they're getting press attention at the moment. But Google's head of European operations, Matt Brittin, also conceded the global scope of the issue during a public apology at the Advertising Week Europe conference on Monday, according to AdAge's report.  "This is a good opportunity for me to say sorry, this should not have happened, and we need to do better," Britten said. Google offered another mea culpa in a blog post last Friday after the British government called a hearing with the company to determine why taxpayer-funded ads were found in such disturbing places. Neither of the apologies offered much in the way of concrete fixes, beyond a vague promise to figure one out in the coming weeks. Wieser cited the lack of clear direction as one of the reasons for the downgrade. "The approach comes across to us as attempting to minimize the problem rather than eliminating it, which is the standard we think that many large brand advertisers expect," he wrote.  You can probably expect to see more hat-in-hand statements from Google this week as its execs face crowds of wary ad professionals at one of the industry's biggest conferences in London. "This is a good opportunity for me to say sorry, this should not have happened, and we need to do better" Google and Facebook currently have duopoly control over the online ads market. Some leading industry figures have recognized that collective force among big brands is the only way to counterbalance that power. Leading the charge is Marc Pritchard, chief marketing officer at the world's biggest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, who's been outspoken in his criticism of the digital ads model. "The days of giving digital a pass are over," Pritchard said in a call to arms at an Association of National Advertisers meeting in January. "It's time to grow up. It's time for action." The boycott in the UK seems to be one of the first instances of advertisers actually following through with that sentiment.  With other long-simmering tensions between marketers and digital platforms now reaching a head — including rampant ad fraud, transparency in how ads are sold, and measurement concerns — it may be only the beginning.  WATCH: Is ad blocking wrong?           Topics: Advertising, alphabet, Business, Google, YouTube About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

See Offers Nation & World Posted March 20 increase font size Google turns buses into rolling study hall With grants for Wi-Fi and donated laptops, students get work done during long commutes in a rural area. Associated Press Share Comment Read Article ST. STEPHEN, S.C. — Eighth-grader Lakaysha Governor spends two hours on the bus getting back and forth to school each day. Thanks to a grant from Google, she can now use that time more productively and get her homework done. The aspiring forensic anthropologist is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina’s rural Berkeley County who will ride to school on one of 28 Google-funded, Wi-Fi-equipped school buses unveiled Monday. The tech giant also has given the school district 1,700 Chromebooks, the stripped-down laptops on which many schoolchildren now do their class and homework. Middle school student Lakaysha Governor works Monday on her Chromebook while riding a school bus outfitted with Wi-Fi by Google. The tech giant hopes to help expand the use of Wi-Fi on school buses in other rural areas of the country. Associated Press/Meg Kinnard Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → As more class assignments and homework migrate online, such long bus rides have generally counted as lost time in preparing for the next school day. But Google said it hopes to help expand the use of Wi-Fi on school buses in other rural areas elsewhere around the country. Google has at least a decade-long relationship with Berkeley County, where it’s invested more than $1 billion in data center complexes since 2007, bringing more than 100 jobs. Google says it also has awarded nearly $2 billion in grants to local schools and nonprofits. Google hopes to see the Wi-Fi program extended into other rural areas of the U.S., including locations where it already has data centers that process search queries and other information, said Lilyn Hester, a Google spokeswoman. The first such effort was launched last year in Caldwell County, North Carolina, where a data center already exists. The expansions are also needs-based, Hester said, and Google is focusing on rural places where broadband internet access has been slow to spread. Google is also looking for ways to make the high-tech buses useful outside of school hours, working with the school district and community on places the buses can go once the school day is done to bring connectivity elsewhere, such as a community center or fellowship hall. Lakaysha, the eight-grader who has her eye on Harvard, has internet access at home like most of her friends. But thanks to the Wi-Fi buses, she can get ahead on her work. Teachers are happy, she said, because “more students are doing their homework.” And she said even rambunctious preschoolers aboard the bus are quieter in the mornings while older students are doing homework. “Now that we have the Chromebooks and the Wi-Fi, they’re kind of quiet; so it’s good for everybody.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

If you're searching for more awesome spots to check out, Google Street View has a ton of them, including natural and historical sites like the Faroe Islands near Norway, many iconic African landmarks and the Samburu National Park in Kenya. Google this: What's it like to go inside a volcano? Through Google Street View, you can also visit the explorers' camp, explore the surrounding jungle, tour the village of Endu and see the stunning black sand beaches. In line with the growing popularity of volcano tourism, Google Street View has gone into the bowels of the earth to capture images of what locals in Vanuatu call a hot-headed husband and wife pair with a tendency to erupt in public spats. Unpredictable and risky, the chief of the local village calls the volcanoes, "devils" but their natural beauty is undeniable. Added Mackley, "You only realise how insignificant humans are when you're standing next to a giant lake of fiery boiling rock". "It's an incredible feeling". But the most challenging part of their journey was when they climbed 400 meters into the Marum crater with a Street View camera. Standing next to a boiling lake of molten rock the size of two football fields has got to be awe-inspiring, but it's also pretty damn risky. "Standing just meters away from one of the most active lava lakes in the world really surges energy through your whole body", Horsley said.

Email | 20 Mar 2017 | Print  ExtraBITS for 20 March 2017 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, the iMessage App Store has stagnated after a promising start, LG has fixed the interference problems in the UltraFine 5K Display, and Google has been caught slipping ads into Google Home responses. iMessage App Store Growth Slowing After Initial Surge -- Analytics firm Sensor Tower has found that while the iMessage App Store that Apple introduced in iOS 10 got off to a strong start, it’s now stagnating. The good news: nearly 5000 apps now boast iMessage compatibility. However, that growth has slowed significantly, from 116 percent between September and the end of October to just 9 percent between January and February. The slowdown doesn’t surprise us, as we’ve found most iMessage apps slow, hard to use, and largely pointless. Are you using any iMessage apps regularly? If so, tell us about them in the comments. Read/post comments LG Fixes UltraFine 5K Display Wi-Fi Interference Problems -- We’ve previously reported on the LG UltraFine 5K Display suffering from interference issues when positioned near a Wi-Fi router. The company promised to improve radio shielding in the monitors, and MacRumors has confirmed that newer units no longer suffer from interference. If you’re buying a new LG UltraFine 5K Display, note that units with serial numbers starting with 702 or 703 feature the upgraded shielding. Owners of older units can contact LG for a repair, which LG says will take 7–10 business days. Read/post comments Google Home Caught Sneaking Ads into Responses -- File this one under the “That’s just wrong” category. Google Home, the search giant’s smart speaker, has been caught slipping ads for the new “Beauty and the Beast” movie into its virtual assistant responses. On Twitter, user Bryson Meunier posted a video showing Google Home promoting the movie when he asked what his day was going to be like. Google insists that it wasn’t an ad, but a way to call out “timely content.” It seems as though the ads have stopped running — we strongly hope the backlash has quelled similar future experimentation on Google’s part. Smart speakers and virtual assistants are stupid enough as it stands; they won’t succeed if they’re both clueless and venal.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons. A top global advertising agency has withdrawn all of its 240 UK clients from Google websites — including YouTube — due to concerns about ads being displayed next to extremist content, the Times of London reported this weekend. According the report, Havas — which represents companies such as O2, Dominos and Hyundai, among many others – spends around £175 million a year in the UK on digital advertising, of which Google gets around £35 million. Google, the report said, failed to give Havas “specific reassurances, policy and guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly enough or with the correct filters.” Related coverage March 23, 2017 8:29 am 0 Watchdog Launches Pictoral Social Media Project to Expose Antisemitic Activity on Campus A new social media project aims to visually expose anti-Jewish activity on campus, the head of the organization behind the initiative... “We have a duty of care to our clients in the UK marketplace,” Paul Frampton, chief executive of Havas UK, was quoted as saying. “Our position will remain until we are confident in the YouTube platform and Google Display Network’s ability to deliver the standards we and our clients expect.” Ronan Harris — managing director of Google UK — was quoted as saying his company had “begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network.” Last week, a top Google executive told British lawmakers that an antisemitic YouTube video titled “Jews admit organizing White Genocide” did not constitute hate speech. While the video — narrated by ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke — was “deeply offensive and shocking,” it did not violate YouTube rules against hate speech and would remain on the site, Google Vice President for Communications and Public Affairs Peter Barron said at a House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee hearing on Tuesday The hearing marked the start of a parliamentary inquiry into online hate.

Advertising Week Europe 2017 is a four-day jamboree of around 175 seminars, workshops and events across the capital. Now in its fifth year, it attracts up to 40,000 visitors. The event is designed as a multiple-themed discussion programme. But this year it's been overshadowed by just one issue: Google, YouTube and adverts appearing next to extremist content. In response, a slew of major advertisers have been pulling their online ads. Google's European boss Matthew Brittin apologised, saying, "If there's something we could do better, we will do it better." Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Advertisers are increasingly using algorithms to automatically buy, sell and place adverts He promised Google would do more through technology and the more rigorous flagging of offending content - although he did not say it would use staff to actively hunt down extremist videos. Industry challenge Away from the main stages, in the coffee bars and lounges at London's Picturehouse Central, many attendees agreed that despite the media focus on Google, the challenge is one for the industry as a whole. Much of this is because of the explosion in programmatic advertising, where advertisers use algorithms to automatically buy, sell and place adverts. Image copyright AWE 2017 Image caption Advertising Week Europe 2017 now attracts up to 40,000 visitors In a world that is going through a surge in smartphone ownership (there are now 2.7 billion smartphone users and there will be five billion by 2020) coupled with an explosive growth in digital video advertising, automation does make sense. Done well it can allow brands to target specific consumers, but it can also allow them to chase audiences without regard to who those people might be. "It's all about automation, doing things at scale," said one speaker. But the dilemma for the industry is that chasing audiences without checking on what sites those audiences might be using leads to the mess Google now faces. "You have to be wary of the environment where you place your ad," insists Cristina Constandache, of the instant messaging and VoIP application, Viber. 'Not believable' Matt Kelly, chief content officer of regional newspaper group Archant, goes further. He says we should not be surprised; the issue of adverts appearing in unwanted places has been an "open" secret in the industry for a while. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kellogg's is one of the brands that has withdrawn advertising from the alt-right news website Breitbart "The idea that nobody has twigged that these ads were appearing next to dodgy content is frankly not believable. Of course they realised this, it's at the heart of programmatic advertising," he says. There are already solutions. Certain websites can be blacklisted. For instance, the alt-right news website Breitbart has faced a sustained campaign to get advertisers to pull their adverts. Other solutions would include hiring staff to vet websites - although this is time-consuming and expensive. Or you can create a "white list" of so-called approved sites. The issue comes down to cost - and how much more brand owners are prepared to advertise and how much we as consumers are prepared to pay for those products. "We all want the cheapest [advertising]," says Unilever's chief marketing officer Keith Weed, "but it comes at a cost." Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lego withdrew product promotions with the Daily Mail newspaper This year, politics has muscled its way onto the stage, as well. Matt Scheckner, the Advertising Week event's founder, says this is not surprising as advertising is "a mirror of the times", whether that's the US presidential election or Brexit. More politics Brands and advertisers themselves have been responding by becoming more political, "taking sides on issues like immigration, the US elections, Brexit, cultural diversity or same sex marriages," says Nick Flynn, senior vice president at Shutterstock, the stock photography, image and music provider. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption At this year's Super Bowl, Airbnb ran an advert criticising President Donald Trump In the UK last October, Lego ended its promotional giveaways with the Daily Mail newspaper amid a campaign to stop firms advertising with some newspapers over "divisive" coverage of migrants. In the US at the 2017 Super Bowl, Airbnb ran an advert criticising President Donald Trump's stance on immigration, declaring "acceptance starts with all of us". Brands are being pushed to take a side, says Flynn partly because "this resonates with the next generation of consumers for whom these issuers are important," but also in recognition of the increasingly diversified audiences they are trying to reach.

Don’t go running to the burbs for a house, report says Guest Commentary: Don’t cut back Colorado’s early voting locations and hours By Stu Woo, Dow Jones Newswires LONDON — An executive for Alphabet Inc.’s Google apologized on Monday for commercials that appeared before extremist videos on its YouTube site and said it would simplify tools that enable advertisers to control where their ads appear. Google already provides such controls, but advertisers weren’t using them perhaps because they were too complex, said Matt Brittin, Google’s president for Europe, Middle East and Africa. “If the controls are there but people aren’t using them, that’s our problem,” Brittin said at an Advertising Week conference in London. Pressure on Google, the world’s biggest advertising platform, has risen after major advertisers, including the U.K. government and the British unit of French advertising giant Havas SA, suspended advertising on YouTube and the Google Display Network last week after a report showing that commercials appeared before videos supporting terrorist groups. On Monday, Marks & Spencer Group PLC became the latest company to suspend its advertising from Google. Mr. Brittin said he would step up enforcement and review policies to make sure ads don’t inadvertently appear next to inappropriate videos. He said Google wanted to be careful with how it did so because some advertisers, such as news organizations, might want to place ads alongside controversial content. “We want to be thoughtful,” he said, adding that Google would reveal more details soon.

As hackers get more aggressive and more sites become outdated, hackers will continue to capitalise by infecting more sites,” Google said in a post on its webmaster blog.Google, which inserts security warnings when it detects hacked sites, said most of those warned can clean up their pages, but that 61 per cent are not notified because their sites are not verified by the search engine.”As always, it’s best to take a preventative approach and secure your site rather than dealing with the aftermath,” the blog said. “Remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.”The news comes amid growing concerns over cybersecurity in the wake of massive… Post navigation Goldman building robo-adviser to give investment advice to the masses The Gateway: Sympathy for ‘half eaten north Queensland idiot’, as mud flies over Gabba debacle Search for: Recent Posts Men!

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Monday, March 13, 2017, 14:00 [IST] Have you ever downloaded any app and later found it useless and uninstalled it. I guess you have. To be able to know how the app works, without downloading it and practically using it would really mean a lot. Considering this, Google has already been testing its Android Instant Apps feature, which allows you to use the app without downloading it. Besides, this feature was first announced last year in May 2016 and it finally made a public appearance just recently in January 2017. SEE ALSO: Google starts testing its Android Instant Apps feature But wait, this is not about Google alone, even Microsoft is now coming up with a similar feature for its apps. The company via official site says, "We are happy to announce the launch of the preview of Playable Ads in the Windows Dev Center." What this basically means is that there is nothing like a free and live access to the app. But this new "preview" will help you to stream the demo which shows how the app works before downloading and installing the app. This program's preview, which was launched last week in the Windows Dev Center, is a video which is not more than 3 minutes. SEE ALSO: Google Instant Apps is reportedly rolling out for some people, here's how to enable the feature Although this adds a good support to the users, it may offer more to the advertisers. The latest Windows feature currently is at a limited preview access and will make its way to public arena soon. However, the company has not specified on the exact launch date of the final version of the feature.

Menu Voices Home Ocean Views Home BioBlitz Cat Watch Explorers Journal Fulbright Stories Voice for Elephants Water Currents Disappearing Landscapes in Louisiana: When Google Maps Can’t Catch Up Posted by Victoria Herrmann of America's Eroding Edges in Ocean Views on March 20, 2017 (1) More » Credit: Eli Keene We’ve all been there when Google Maps goes horribly wrong. We’re on our way out to dinner when it tells us to turn onto a ramp that doesn’t exist. Or we’re frantically trying to find an alternative route around the parking lot that is the highway when our GPS has us make a U-turn, on a one-way street, going the wrong way. Occasionally, it’s the phone’s fault–it gets hopelessly confused and reroutes on its own accord. But, the fault isn’t always on the GPS, no matter how much we yell at our phones. You see, we as humans have a knack for rapidly transforming the landscapes within which we live, at times making it difficult for Google’s imagery to catch up. We can erect complex highway structures in a matter of years and reconfigure our streets to include bike lanes within months. All in all, these relatively quick alterations and outdated maps are annoying, but harmless. They add maybe 20 minutes to the drive–and a bit of road rage. But sometimes, changing our landscapes does worse than causing us to make the wrong turn. Credit: Eli Keene It’s mid-January of 2017 and my research partner and I have taken a two-hour drive south of New Orleans, past the levees and into the bayous. We’re on a powerboat, with Donald Dardar, Chairman of the Poite-au-Chien tribe, at the helm. He’s acting as both a historic and ecological guide to the waterways he’s been navigating his whole life–playing as a child, working as a fisherman, showing visitors like us the ins and outs of life on the water. According to Google Maps, we should be on land. But we’re not. We’re in a boat. We’ve been snaking through channels in Louisiana’s coastal wetlands for nearly a half hour and have now reached what appears to be open water stretching out towards the horizon. From where we’re standing, there is no visible land between us and the Gulf. Still, it’s no surprise that my phone thinks we’re on solid ground. Here, in the marshes beyond New Orleans, coastal communities are seeing some of the most dramatic environmental changes happening in America today. On average, Southern Louisiana loses a football field of land to the Gulf of Mexico every hour. Between 1932 and 2010, Louisiana lost nearly 2,000 square miles, an area as large as the entire state of Delaware. As Louisiana’s landscapes transform into seascapes at an alarming rate, it’s not just land that’s lost. It’s people’s histories, their livelihoods, and their homes. Credit: Eli Keene Along our journey, Donald explains what was once here. He points out where the last house of his community once stood, surrounded by forested wetlands. We stop at the town’s old cemetery, marked by a sole wooden cross, and spot some horses across the way, still owned by Pointe aux Chene residents but abandoned here when the community gradually retreated inland behind the levee system to escape erosion. Although the Pointe Aux Chenes community still thrives up the bayou, it is eerie to traverse a landscape dotted with the carcasses of trees and imagine what was once here: a school building and houses; horses and cattle. A homeland. Donald’s experience is not unique. As sea levels rise, coastal communities across our country are watching their homelands disappear, and with them, centuries of culture, tangible history, and family traditions. Over the past year I’ve been traveling across the United States and U. S. Territories with my research partner to refocus America’s climate change story on the people who are living on the front lines of our eroding edges. We’re creating a database of hundreds of interviews to better understand how a warmer world is changing the way we live in America, and to better identify what can be done to empower and support people like Donald that are in need of adaptation today. My expedition began last January, around the same time that another Louisiana community was making national headlines as the site of America’s first climate change refugees. On January 21, 2016 the state of Louisiana received $52 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to relocate the community of Isle de Jean Charles further inland. That grant money made Isle de Jean Charles the first federally funded town in the United States to move because of the effects of climate change. Isle de Jean Charles, locally known as the Island, is a narrow strip of land about a 10 minute drive from Point aux Chene. It has been home to a resilient community of Native Americans who have lived, subsisted, and commercially fished in the bayou for over 180 years. While the community is strong, the island itself is not. Since 1955, Isle de Jean Charles has lost more than 98 percent of its land, and because of this, many families have been forced to leave. What was once a 350-person community is now down to just 70 residents. Credit: Eli Keene We as humans have a knack for rapidly transforming the landscapes around us. Manmade climate change is arguably the biggest and most catastrophic of those transformations. In a matter of decades, we’ve contributed to the melting of hundreds of miles of sea ice in the Arctic. We’ve helped make entire countries in the Pacific Ocean uninhabitable. We’ve made Google Maps unusable just two hours south of New Orleans. But while climate change is the impetus for Isle de Jean Charles’s relocation, it is only the very last chapter in a centuries-long story of man-made environmental change along the Gulf Coast. If there is one takeaway from my travels, it is that climate change in America is, at its core, a story of how we’ve been mistreating our environment since long before greenhouse gas emissions warmed our planet. It’s a story of poor land-use decisions and actions that have degraded our ecosystems, cutting down our only natural defenses to the extreme storms we are experiencing today. To understand why Isle de Jean Charles, Pointe aux Chenes, and ultimately New Orleans are more vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise, we need to understand how humans have changed the very fabric of Louisiana’s landscapes. That story starts in the 1920s. Before Deepwater drilling and offshore rigs, oil was first extracted from the marshes themselves. A mile offshore, oil and gas companies would build homemade wooden platforms on oyster shells and drill for the black gold of the Gulf. But in order to get barges and eventually drilling rigs and pipelines through the marsh, companies needed to create water pathways. Over the past 80 years, fossil fuel companies have cut at least 10,000 miles of canals across coastal Louisiana. These canals gave rigs access to the Gulf. But they also allowed saltwater to flow into the wetlands, killing the very plants and trees that hold the land together. Soon, what was once a stable ecosystem turned into an extensive and expanding network of coastal erosion that gets worse with every storm. Credit: Eli Keene Back in January, I interviewed Curtis Henderson, a member of the Homa Nation that grew up on Isle de Jean Charles,  on the second story of the Island’s marina looking out over the now crisscrossed wetlands. As we talk, he points down below to where the oil industry made its first cuts. They now look more like lakes than canals. The water affects everything here. It floods homes during storms, rusts out new cars within a year, and makes growing any food for subsistence nearly impossible. Curtis Henderson left Isle de Jean Charles in 1978, when the island began to flood beyond what his family could cope with. In his words, “it was g-d’s country before it got all ate up. But now there’s nothing left.” Even though Curtis has moved away from the Island, he still owns property here–passed down from generation to generation. He’s hesitant about the relocation planning. His grandparents are buried here, and he wants his own grandchildren to be a part of this community. He says, “It’s hard to let go of something that go so deep into your family.” If it weren’t for the flooding and saltwater, Curtis would move back tomorrow. When we destroy our coastal wetlands, communities like isle de jean Charles and Pointe Aux Chenes are the first to see increases in flooding, but they’re not the last. New Orleans’ safety depends on far more than the levee system. Coastal wetlands help to form a natural barrier against hurricanes coming in from the Gulf, which lose strength as they travel over land. As oil companies cut away thousands of miles of wetlands, that first line of defense moves closer and closer to the city limits of New Orleans, making the threat of severe flooding during the next storm far worse for the Big Easy. New Orleans is just one city in one state. According to current models, by the end of this century, at least 414 towns, villages, and cities across America will eventually be flooded no matter how much humans decrease carbon emissions. At the minimum, this would equate to 4.3 million Americans displaced from their homes by 2100. And that’s according to low-end NASA sea level rise predictions. At the high-end, over 13 million people along America’s coastlines will embark on a great migration inland. But humans hold the immense ability to rapidly transform our landscapes–for the worse, or for the better. And that’s what we’re doing in the face of changing maps–we’re adapting our built environments and restoring our natural ones to save homelands from New Orleans to the Chesapeake Bay. In Pointe Aux Chene, residents are raising houses to allow flood water and storm surges to pass safely below. Farther upstream in Homa, they’re experimenting with salt-resistant crops to ensure culturally appropriate food security in the face of saltwater intrusion. Across state lines in Mississippi, the historic black community of Turkey Creek is using a community-driven watershed plan to protect homes by restoring the ecological functions and natural connections to their ecosystem. And in Miami Beach, the city is restoring their coastal dune system, providing not just protection from storms but also a public recreation space. Credit: Eli Keene We began this project with the goal of telling America’s climate change story. It was a story we thought we knew. A story of disappearing land, flooded homes, and people on the move. Climate change in America is all of those things. But there’s another part of the story we didn’t know until we saw it. This is the presence of strong local leaders who are doing everything they can to adapt their homes to the consequences of climate change we can no longer avoid. It’s the mayor in deep-red Alabama who, once the door to his office is shut, asks how much time his town has and what else can be done to protect it. It’s the activist in Miami who spends so much time hounding local officials about the social impacts of climate change on minority neighborhoods that she ends up on the city’s official sea level rise task force. At a time when the new administration denies the very existence of climate change, it can be easy to throw up your hands and say we’re doomed. But the spirit of American ingenuity lives on–in New Orleans, in the bayous of Louisiana, across our coastlines. And it is driven by strong, passionate local champions. While we may be changing our landscape beyond what Google Maps can recognize, and we will inevitably see some difficult times ahead, the America I have seen over the past year is creative, inspiring, and not ready to surrender itself to the rising seas.

She is also the President & Managing Director of The Arctic Institute, where she leads the Institute’s research on climate change and community adaptation in Arctic communities. (1) More » Comments Raymond Post Baton Rouge, Louisiana March 21, 2:06 pm I am very familiar with what the author points out about the marshes of south Louisiana having boated, hunted and fished in them for sixty years. No doubt to me that part of the cause is the climatological changes, and it doesn’t matter if you think it is man-made global warming or a snap-shot of a natural cyclacle phenomena. However, it is disappointing that the article fails to report on two additional significant impacts. They are the natural subsidence which has always occured and the channelization of the Mississippi River so the silt-laden waters are sent almost to the mouth of the river rather than flooding out into the marshes, constantly re-buidlling the subsidence and adding more marshland to what was already in place. The whole story should be told.

Though most Britons have barely adopted the term "fintech", online banking is old hat in Beijing. Last Thursday, I toured the museum with its founder, Mr Wang Wei, who delighted in showing me exhibits such as a bitcoin cash machine. The cryptocurrency is eight years old; in today's China that's ancient enough to belong in a glass display case. Some time soon, Europe needs a similarly designed museum of political idiocy. In its glass cases I would like to exhibit stuffed specimens of politicians who have so hopelessly failed to understand the information technology revolution that began in California in the 1970s and has now almost completely taken over the world. Prime candidates for the taxidermist's knife are the members of the Commons Home Affairs Committee. Last Tuesday, they laid into Google, Facebook and Twitter for not doing enough to censor the Web on their behalf. Ms Yvette Cooper, their chairman, complained that Facebook had failed to take down a page with the title "Ban Islam". As she put it: "We need you to do more and to have more social responsibility to protect people." Another possible exhibit in the museum of political idiocy is Germany's justice minister, Mr Heiko Maas, who unveiled a draft law last week to impose fines of up to €50 million (S$75.2 million) on social networks that failed to delete "hate speech" or "fake news". He said: "Too little illegal content is being deleted and it's not being deleted sufficiently quickly." If these people want censorship, let them get on with it - I know some people in China who can help - but arguing that Google and Facebook should do the censoring is nuts. As if these companies were not already mighty enough, European politicians want to give them the power to limit free expression. Best of all is the revelation that government advertising has ended up on extremist and white supremacist websites. The news that the Department for International Development and the Metropolitan police have been spending taxpayers' money in this undiscriminating way just strikes me as more evidence of European naivety. There are three essential points to understand about the IT revolution. First, it was almost entirely a United States-based achievement, albeit with contributions from computer scientists who came to Silicon Valley from all over the world and Asian manufacturers who drove down the costs of hardware. Museums are where history's victors display their trophies. What I learnt last week is that China may be winning the latest battle in the IT wars: to take not just banking but money itself online. Most of the big breakthroughs in software that made mass personal computing possible were made in America - think Microsoft and Apple. The Internet, too, was made in America. Online retail was made by Amazon, founded in 1994 in Seattle. Online search based on the PageRank algorithm: made by Google, founded in 1996, its first office a garage in Menlo Park, California. Online social networking for one and all: made by Facebook, founded in 2004 at Harvard. YouTube (2005), Twitter (2006), the iPhone (2007), Uber (2009), Snapchat (2011)... You get the idea. Point two: the most important of these companies are now mind-blowingly dominant. In Facebook's little red book, written to indoctrinate (sorry, train) employees, it is written: "The quick shall inherit the earth." Mr Mark Zuckerberg has certainly inherited quite a chunk of this planet. His social network now has 1.23 billion active daily users. Google and Facebook are predicted to increase their combined share of all digital advertising this year to 60 per cent. Google has 78 per cent of US search advertising. Facebook has 39 per cent of online display advertising. Yes, there really are a lot of credulous people managing advertising budgets these days. "But, Mr Google, my ad ended up on a pro-ISIS website!" "Bummer, dude." Third point: this dominance translates into crazy money. Facebook will make US$16 billion (S$22.4 billion) from display advertising this year. The business is valued today at about US$400 billion, including a US$30 billion cash pile. That equips Mr Zuckerberg to buy up pretty much whatever comes along that he likes the look of - as he did with Instagram, for example. It is an amazing state of affairs. Consider the functions these companies perform. Google is essentially a vast global library; it's where we go to look things up. Amazon is a vast global bazaar, where more and more of us go to shop. And Facebook is a vast global club. The various networking functions these companies perform are not new; it's just that technology has made the networks both enormous and very fast. However, the more interesting difference is that in the past, libraries and social clubs did not make money from advertising. They were funded out of donations or subscriptions or taxes. In other words, the truly revolutionary fact is that our global library and our global club are both making money from advertising, and that the more we tell them about ourselves, the more effective the advertising becomes, sending us off to Mr Jeff Bezos' bazaar with increasing frequency. Not for nothing is "Fang" the investors' acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. These guys really have got their teeth into us. Confronted with this American network revolution, the rest of the world had two options: capitulate or compete. The Europeans chose the former. You will look in vain for a European search engine, giant online retailer or social network. The US Fang has been well and truly sunk into the European Union. By contrast, the Chinese opted to compete. By fair means and foul, they made life difficult for the Americans. And they encouraged their own entrepreneurs to build businesses that rival the giants of Silicon Valley. The acronym of the moment in Beijing is "Bat": Baidu (the biggest search engine), Alibaba (Mr Jack Ma's answer to Amazon) and Tencent (which is the nearest thing to Facebook). These companies are much more than clones of their US counterparts; each has been innovative in its own right. A good example is Tencent's ubiquitous messaging app WeChat, which, by using QR codes to allow users to exchange contact details, is fast destroying the business card. Needless to say, Silicon Valley gnashes its fangs at being shut out of the vast Chinese market. Mr Zuckerberg has not yet given up hope, doing interviews in Mandarin and even jogging through the smog of Tiananmen Square. The recent experience of Uber cannot encourage him. Last year, it ran up the white flag in China, accepting that it could not beat the home-grown ride-sharing business Didi Chuxing. Cue more gnashing. I have to say I admire how China took on Silicon Valley and won. It was not only smart economically but smart politically too. In Beijing, Big Brother now has the big data he needs to keep very close tabs on Chinese netizens. And good luck to the US National Security Agency as it tries to get through the Great Firewall of China. Museums are where history's victors display their trophies. What I learnt last week is that China may be winning the latest battle in the IT wars: to take not just banking but money itself online. And if you don't believe me, I'll bet you one bitcoin - or £840 (S$1,455) if you accept only old money. THE SUNDAY TIMES, LONDON Niall Ferguson is a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution, Stanford.

Lakysha is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina’s rural Berkeley County benefiting from a grant from Google, which on Monday unveiled one of its WiFi-equipped school buses in the area. (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard) St. STEPHEN, S.C. – For eighth-grader Lakaysha Governor, her daily two-hour school bus commute had been spent catching up with friends and trying to tune out distractions from unruly preschoolers. Now, thanks to Google, the aspiring forensic anthropologist said she’s able to spend that time finishing up her daily school work so she’s free to engage in her favorite activity once she gets home: reading. Lakaysha is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina’s rural Berkeley County benefiting from a grant from Google, which on Monday unveiled one of its 28 Wi-Fi-equipped school buses in the area. The tech giant has also given the school district 1,700 Chromebooks, the stripped-down laptops on which public schoolchildren do their class and homework as school books largely are replaced by online worksheets and articles. Some students like Lakaysha in this sprawling, rural district about 50 miles north of Charleston spend a total of two hours riding the bus to and from school each day. With much of students’ homework now online-only, that’s time lost in terms of trying to prepare for the next day. The grant, Google’s first of a kind in South Carolina, is no accident. Google has at least a decade-long relationship with Berkeley County, where it’s invested more than $1 billion in data center complexes in Berkeley County since 2007, bringing more than 100 jobs. Google says it also has awarded nearly $2 billion in grants to local schools and nonprofits. Google hopes to expand the Wi-Fi program into other rural areas across the country, including other areas where it already has data centers, which process search queries and other information, according to Lilyn Hester, a Google spokeswoman based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The first such effort was launched last year in Caldwell County, North Carolina, where a data center already exists. The expansions are also needs-based, Hester said, and Google is focusing on rural places where broadband internet access has been slow to spread. “Why don’t we make that instructional time?” Hester said of officials mused about the time many students spend on school buses. Google is already looking for ways to make the high-tech buses useful outside of school hours, working with the school district and community on places the buses can go once the school day is done to bring connectivity elsewhere, such as a community center or fellowship hall. Lakaysha, the eight-grader who has her eye on Harvard, has internet access at home like most of her friends. But thanks to the Wi-Fi buses, she can get ahead on her work. Teachers are happy, she said, because “more students are doing their homework.” And those rambunctious preschoolers are even quieter in the mornings, too. “Now that we have the Chromebooks and the Wi-Fi, they’re kind of quiet; so it’s good for everybody_” Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Tumblr Telegram Related Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Scroll down for videos  Facebook has introduced its weapon to combat 'fake news'. Users have reported seeing a pop-up window when they attempted to share articles that were deemed inaccurate by third-party fact-checkers Facebook has been criticized for the amount of fake news floating around its platform and has been attacked for not taking the steps to do anything about it. 'There have been some accusations that say that we actually want this kind of content on our service because its more content and people click on it, but that's crap,' said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg while visiting North Carolina A7T State university earlier this month.

DETAILS OF FACEBOOK'S FACT-CHECKING PROGRAM  Facebook itself will not decide what is real and what is considered fake. Instead, it is enlisting The Poynter Institute, a Florida journalism school, to sift through content. The Poynter Institute is the host of the International Fact Checking Network which bills itself as a 'global alliance of fact checkers'. The new alert system appeared when many users tried to share a story that made false claims about people from Ireland were forced to come to the US as slaves. When users attempted to share the link they were instantly met with an alert Its members include ABC News, Politico, The Associated Press and Snopes.com and The Washington Post.  The Network receives funding from various sources including the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, the Duke Reporters’ Lab, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, the National Endowment for Democracy, the Omidyar Network, the Open Society Foundations and the Park Foundation. All describe themselves as non-profit organizations.    The Network will rely on its 'code of principles' to decipher between fake and real content. It asks signatories adhere to the following principles; - Non-partisanship and fairness - Transparency of sources - Transparency of funding and organization - Transparency of methodology - Commitment to open and honest corrections The new alert system appeared when many users tried to share a story that made false claims about thousands of people from Ireland were forced to come to the US as slaves. The article, entitled 'The Irish slave trade – The slaves that time forgot', was published by Newport Buzz on March 7 and began making its way to Facebook leading up to St. Patrick's Day. However, the moment users placed the link in 'What's on your mind' box, they were notified that the article had been disputed by Associate Press and Snopes.com. Then another message appeared when users attempt to post it regardless of the warning. Then another message appeared when users attempt to post the flase article regardless of the warning. The feature appears to be on both desktop (pictured) and in the app GOOGLE TO CRACK DOWN ON FAKE NEWS  Google has over 10,000 quality raters, contractors worldwide that evaluate search results. Raters are given actual searches to conduct, drawn from real searches that Google sees. They then rate pages that appear in the top results as to how good those seem as answers. Quality raters do not have the power to alter Google's results directly. Instead, the data produced by quality raters is used to improve Google's search algorithms generally. In time, that data might have an impact on low-quality pages that are spotted by raters, as well as on others that weren't reviewed. Quality raters use a set of guidelines that are nearly 200 pages long, instructing them on how to assess website quality and whether the results they review meet the needs of those who might search for particular queries.  'Before you share this content, you might want to know that the fact-checking sites, Associated Press and Snopes.com disputed its accuracy,' reads the message. Users do have the option to 'Post Anyway', but they can also learn more about the disputed content where Facebook shares links to Snopes's and AP's pages that fact-check the article – showing users why it was deemed false news. The feature is said to only be available for some users and Facebook has not announced when it will roll out to the masses. DailyMail.com has contacted Facebook for comment and has yet to receive a response.  Facebook revealed that it would use fact-checkers to crack down on false stories in December, following accusations it allowed the spread of 'fake news' to swing the election.  Fake news stories on Facebook have touched on a broad range of subjects, from unproven cancer cures to celebrity hoaxes and backyard Bigfoot sightings. Users do have the option to 'Post Anyway', but they can also learn more about the disputed content where Facebook shares links to Snopes's and AP's pages that fact-check the article – showing users why it was deemed false news But fake political stories have drawn attention because of the possibility that they influenced public perceptions and could have swayed the U.S. presidential election. And others have dangerous real-world consequences. A fake story about a child sex ring at a Washington, D.C., pizza joint prompted a man to fire an assault rifle inside the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong. 'We do believe that we have an obligation to combat the spread of fake news,' said John Hegeman, vice president of product management on News Feed.  By partnering with respected outside organizations and flagging, rather than removing, fake stories, Facebook is sidestepping some of the biggest concerns experts had raised about it exercising its considerable power in this area.  For instance, some worried that Facebook might act as a censor — and not a skillful one, either, being an engineer-led company with little experience making complex media ethics decisions.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg insists that fake news constitutes less than one percent of what's on Facebook , but critics say that's wildly misleading. For a site with nearly 2 billion users tapping out posts by the millisecond, even one percent is a huge number, especially since the total includes everything that's posted on Facebook — photos, videos and daily updates in addition to news articles.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 140 shares Most watched News videos Shocking moment terror attacker's car speeds across bridge Dramatic video shows horror of aftermath on Westminster Bridge Terrified public flee as three shots ring out in Parliament Square Commotion outside Parliament as police react after attack Injured people lay stricken on Westminster Bridge after attack Horrifying car crash scene shows victim at Parliament railings 'Go! go!'

Matthew Brittin, the president of Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) business and operations at Google, promised to review the company’s advertising policies and practices to combat the problem. "I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Brittin said at the Advertising Week Europe event in London on Monday. Read: YouTube Starts New Program Where Users Can Volunteer To Moderate The Site Advertising firms HSBC and Marks and Spencer were the latest to pull their advertisements from the British market due to their content being attached to controversial content. Audi, McDonalds and L'Oreal previously removed ads as well. The British government also suspended its advertising campaigns on YouTube after some of its advertisements landed on videos that contained offensive material, including homophobic and anti-semitic content. According to a report from Reuters, Britain is the second-largest market for Google outside the United States. The company generated $7.8 billion from advertising in the region last year, making up nearly 9 percent of the search giant’s global revenue. Google claimed on Friday during a meeting with advertising industry leaders and government officials that it removed ads appearing on channels or videos that contain hate speech, violent or offensive content. Despite Google’s promise to continue to examine and improve its advertising practices, firms are still questioning the company’s commitment. For Google, monitoring the content on YouTube is a difficult task. The video hosting platform has an estimated 500 hours of video content uploaded every minute, most of which is left to automated moderation tools and volunteer staff. Read: Google Removes 200 Websites From Ad Network For Misleading Users Earlier this year, Google began c racking down on the content it allowed its AdWords platform to appear next to. The decision was made in response to accusations that the company provided financial benefit to fake news sites that generated ad revenue by getting clicks and views.

(FEYE) Stock Has 70% Upside. Here’s Why. Recent Posts: Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finds Growth in AI and Mobile BofA Thinks FireEye, Inc. (FEYE) Stock Has 70% Upside. Here’s Why. 6 Tech Stocks to Buy for the VR Boom View All Posts You would think that irrelevant ads on mobile devices and desktops would go away, yet Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) defies that belief. The search engine giant is as relevant as ever, and its targeted advertising model is a favorite for advertisers and marketing teams. Source: Shutterstock Near a yearly high and at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 31 times, the company faces no headwinds. Competition from Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is hardly a concern, even after GOOGL’s weak Google+ offering. Alphabet’s Electronic Money Business Google’s Gmail for the web now allows for sending money from within the Android app. This could threaten PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL). For now, though, PayPal need not worry. Google users may not even know about this money-transferring features. PayPal’s branding is so solid that it, along with investors, should not expect an erosion in its business. So, Google Wallet, and even Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, have too little of the market share in electronic payments at this time. Still, GOOGL’s foray in this business is a necessity. It cannot rely entirely on advertising for all of its revenue. Despite Google and Facebook dominating the digital advertising space, Google’s reliance on ad clicks is a clear risk. In the fourth quarter, the company faced higher hardware costs, as it invested in the new Pixel phone, Daydream View Virtual Reality and Google Home. But the good news is that Google’s revenue growth of 22% year-over-year to $26.06 billion allows the company to invest. Investors are hardly worried: the stock bottomed at the $800 per share range on Feb. 1 and has surged over $860 a share. Increasing ad content to grow profit margins brings risks for GOOGL shareholders. Google’s search results will worsen if it continues pushing too many paid ads or its own services before it connects the user to the proper search results. Just do a search for a “car,” The search results display at least five ads before the useful results show up below them. On the desktop, this is not entirely unusable because the user gets the results on one screen. On mobile, the ads add to scrolling time for the user. The more frustrating the user experience, the more likely users will start abandoning Google.com in favor of Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing or DuckDuckGo.

Here's why. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Mar 20, 2017 at 5:35PM Following a strong end to last week as the Federal Reserve decided to increase interest rates, the stock market was mostly flat on Monday, with major indexes waffling between positive and negative territory throughout the day. Still, a few stocks left investors reeling today, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) DryShips (NASDAQ:DRYS), and Sonic Corporation (NASDAQ:SONC). Let's take a closer look at what drove these declines. Is Google losing its advertising mojo? Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell a modest half percent after Pivotal Research group analyst Brian Wieser downgraded his rating on shares to hold from buy, expressing concern that advertisers are pulling marketing investments from the internet search titan's platforms over concerns regarding the placement of their ads. To blame, Pivotal says, was a Times of London report (may require subscription) last month indicating video ads from several well-known brands were seen displayed on neo-Nazi and jihadist websites. Image source: Alphabet. In particular, Pivotal notes global advertising company Havas opted to stop spending on YouTube and Google display ads last week, while separate reports indicate several industry giants like McDonald's, HSBC, and Audi are all considering similar moves to pull away from Google advertising. "While Google has apologized for the incidents," Wieser added, "and while the scale of the underlying problem may be relatively small in absolute terms, for larger marketers any one instance of an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm a brand's business value." DryShips' big offering Next, shares of dry bulk shipping company DryShips dropped more than 17% after the company filed for a massive $2 billion mixed shelf offering. The move gives DryShips the flexibility to sell a variety of its securities to raise money including common shares, preferred shares debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts, rights, and units, and provides no specific time table or limit to the number of offerings it can employ to do so. Dryships has already gone through a staggering transformation over the past year, from selling ships to pay debt, raising capital and opening revolving credit facilities to solidify its balance sheet, and announcing its strategic expansion in the gas carrier market just over two months ago. But this mixed shelf offering means more dilution for shareholders is likely coming, even after the company's questionable decision to initiate a fixed $2.5 million quarterly dividend a few weeks ago.  Sonic gives one analyst indigestion Finally, shares of drive-in restaurant chain Sonic fell 3% after receiving a downgrade to hold from buy at Canaccord Genuity. Canaccord also reduced its per-share price target on Sonic to $24 from $30 -- shares currently trade just above $23 -- citing a trend of softer sales lately and longer-term concerns over increasing competition from "non-traditional venues" like convenience stores. What's more, the analyst firm believes Sonic's recent discounting will continue, and that its lack of new menu innovation will do it no favors in today's difficult dining industry environment. As it stands, investors should receive more clarity on Sonic's business when the company releases fiscal second-quarter 2017 results next week. But in the meantime, this downgrade has pushed Sonic stock to near a fresh 52-week low. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Hacked websites on the rise: Google Technology Monday 20 March 2017 - 9:28pm FILE: Google, which inserts security warnings when it detects hacked sites, said most of those warned can clean up their pages, but that 61 percent are not notified because their sites are not verified by the search engine. Photo: Wikimedia Commons WASHINGTON - Google painted a bleak picture of cyber security trends Monday, saying the number of websites hacked rose 32 percent last year, with little relief in sight. "We don't expect this trend to slow down. As hackers get more aggressive and more sites become outdated, hackers will continue to capitalise by infecting more sites," Google said in a post on its webmaster blog. Google, which inserts security warnings when it detects hacked sites, said most of those warned can clean up their pages, but that 61 percent are not notified because their sites are not verified by the search engine. "As always, it's best to take a preventative approach and secure your site rather than dealing with the aftermath," the blog said. "Remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link." The news comes amid growing concerns over cyber security in the wake of massive hacks affecting Yahoo, the US government and major e-commerce firms. Google said certain website hacks often follow similar patterns -- some insert "gibberish" on a page, while others create Japanese text that links to fake brand merchandise sites. "Hacking behaviour is constantly evolving, and research allows us to stay up to date on and combat the latest trends," Google said. AFP Comment Now!

STEPHEN, S.C. — Eighth-grader Lakaysha Governor spends two hours on the bus getting back and forth to school each day. Thanks to a grant from Google, she can now use that time more productively and get her homework done. The aspiring forensic anthropologist is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina’s rural Berkeley County who will ride to school on one of 28, Google-funded, Wi-Fi-equipped school buses unveiled Monday. The tech giant also has given the school district 1,700 Chromebooks, the stripped-down laptops on which many schoolchildren now do their class and homework. As more class assignments and homework migrate online, such long bus rides have generally counted as lost time in preparing for the next school day. But Google said it hopes to help expand the use of Wi-Fi on school buses in other rural areas elsewhere around the country. Google has at least a decade-long relationship with Berkeley County, where it’s invested more than $1 billion in data center complexes since 2007, bringing more than 100 jobs. Google says it also has awarded nearly $2 billion in grants to local schools and nonprofits. Google hopes to see the Wi-Fi program extended into other rural areas of the U.S., including locations where it already has data centers that process search queries and other information, according to Lilyn Hester, a Google spokeswoman based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The first such effort was launched last year in Caldwell County, North Carolina, where a data center already exists. The expansions are also needs-based, Hester said, and Google is focusing on rural places where broadband internet access has been slow to spread. “Why don’t we make that instructional time?” Hester said of officials who have mused about the time many students spend on school buses. Google is also looking for ways to make the high-tech buses useful outside of school hours, working with the school district and community on places the buses can go once the school day is done to bring connectivity elsewhere, such as a community center or fellowship hall. Lakaysha, the eight-grader who has her eye on Harvard, has internet access at home like most of her friends. But thanks to the WiFi buses, she can get ahead on her work. Teachers are happy, she said, because “more students are doing their homework.” And she said even rambunctious preschoolers aboard the bus are quieter in the mornings while older students are doing homework. “Now that we have the Chromebooks and the WiFi, they’re kind of quiet; so it’s good for everybody.” Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Google thaws (a little) on defamation cases Possible legal remedies for online reputation issues are still up in the air, explains contributor Chris Silver Smith, arguing that it may be time to amend the applicable legislation. Chris Silver Smith on March 20, 2017 at 2:39 pm More Google’s recent freeze on granting defamation removal requests has thawed a little. Even so, the company’s actions around harmful and dishonest items attacking the reputations of individuals and organizations continue to be mystifyingly inconsistent. In this column, I’ll share some facts and thoughts on how defamation victims should proceed given the current environment. Before I start, let me first take a moment to disclose that I work in the online reputation management field. In my previous article on this subject, one online pundit claimed that I’d failed to disclose that I do so “in the normal place for such disclaimers,” though I mentioned working on such cases in the text of the column. While this critic did not point out anything that I had written that was erroneous, he implied that my points should be either discounted or suspect because I work to help people manage and repair their reputations online. Actually, despite my somewhat passionate railing against Google on behalf of online defamation victims in that earlier article, I stand to profit if Google halts removals because my firm makes money by helping people manage their online reputations using search engine optimization (SEO) and other tactics that aren’t necessary when removals occur. The background on the freeze As I outlined a little over a month back, Google essentially halted processing of defamation removal requests, even when accompanied by duly executed court orders specifying URLs containing defamatory content. I learned this by polling a number of the attorneys across the US that specialize in defamation cases and using court orders establishing content as defamatory as a means of petitioning Google to remove the URLs from their search results. For perhaps as long as a decade now, this process has provided relief to people who really had no other options for removing damaging and untrue representations about themselves from highly-prominent visibility. According to the attorneys I polled (some of whom showed me communications directly from Google), at that time, Google had largely suspended all new removal requests. Google thaws. A little. Since writing that article, there seems to have been a slight thawing on the part of Google’s removal evaluation team. Attorneys are now reporting that a few requests are now being acted upon — some of which were previously denied by Google. Unfortunately, other requests are still being declined, and Google continues to refuse to communicate what they will or will not do, or why they previously denied some requests and then subsequently elected to fulfill them. Here are just a few examples of cases these attorneys told me about in which Google has declined to act: A company spent two years and several hundred thousand dollars pursuing a court order establishing defamation on a Ripoff Report Page in order to petition Google to remove the URL. A real estate agent was defamed and harassed for months via weekly posts by a person in a dispute with them over rent payments. These posts falsely accused the real estate agent of being a criminal, and the defendant made other misrepresentations via online reviews. The real estate agent sued in a typical court process that was pending for over a year, and it was established that the IP address responsible for the defamatory content was connected with the defamer. Subpoenas had been issued, but before records were received, the defendant admitted to posting the content, and, on this basis, a court order was obtained identifying the material as defamatory. Google initially agreed to remove the URLs, but some were not removed due to a clerical error wherein a character was missing from the links. After this error was pointed out, and after months of communications, Google then requested more information to prove the defendant wrote the items. Eventually, Google denied the removal request despite both the attorneys for the plaintiff and the defendant repeatedly offering to provide additional information. Subsequently, Google reinstated the links they had earlier removed. An ALS charity and its founder were attacked online by someone who had a personal grievance against the founder. Though the postings did not directly allege any malfeasance on the part of the charity, its reputation, along with the founder’s, has been damaged. The charity, which has helped many people afflicted with ALS in the past 10 years, continues to be impacted by the defamatory content — likely damaging its fundraising and therefore indirectly keeping needed assistance from people suffering from ALS and their families. A company, its owner and the owner’s wife were defamed by a disgruntled investor who hid their identity and published websites, YouTube videos and a Ripoff Report. The attorneys for the harmed parties discovered who posted the information by obtaining the person’s IP address information, then sued the defamer and obtained a court order. When the removal request was initially submitted, Google denied it with no explanation. Then, when it was resubmitted, Google requested further evidence proving the defendant had been properly served notice, which was done in person via a court process server. Then, Google demanded evidence that the defendant wrote the Ripoff Report content, since the defendant had removed all of the other items. The attorneys provided the IP evidence from both the Ripoff Report and a YouTube video that was subject to the court order — both showed the same user’s email address and the IP address that was used. Google then summarily denied the request without any explanation. For a look at the other side of the coin — requests with which Google complies — we can examine yet another case. In this instance, a woman was defamed and cast in a false light by someone who posted on numerous URLs accusing her of having an affair with the accuser’s husband, in some cases even sharing a photo of the woman. Google previously had denied the removal request, and then in mid-February, agreed to remove most of the content specified. Postings that Google agreed to remove from its results included posts on Ripoff Report, Pissed Consumer and USAComplaints.com. Confusion makes decision-making in such cases very difficult For defamation victims and attorneys that represent them, this situation continues to be confusing and upsetting. Without some sort of consistency, it is quite difficult to determine whether it will be advisable to undertake expensive litigation proceedings. Imagine someone has anonymously vilified you or your business online, with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of items published that misrepresent you. The legal process to handle the issue goes something like this: You must go before a court to obtain a subpoena to get information from the publisher. That information may not identify the person doing the posting, so you may have to go back before the judge to obtain a subpoena for the ISP that operates the IP address associated with the content creator. You discover the person connected with the IP address, and then you take them to court to establish that they harmed you with false representations. Once you obtain an injunction to stop them from continuing to defame you, and a court order establishing the things they posted were false and defamatory, you then take it to the websites and to Google and ask them to remove these items. Some websites are outside of US jurisdiction and will simply ignore you. Other sites, like Ripoff Report, opt to do nothing because US law doesn’t require it. And Google may or may not decide to remove the URLs. You may have spent tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, to obtain relief at this point, only to be denied by Google without receiving any explanation. As I explained in the previous article, one can see why Google chooses to perform some assessment of the removal requests they receive to ensure everything is valid, and because there have apparently been cases of fraud perpetrated on the courts, Google seems to be performing an audit of each court order to determine whether those accused of defamation have been adequately identified and notified of court proceedings, whether the identified prohibited content is residing at URLs identified in court orders, and more. In my opinion, Google would be better off leaving such issues to the courts — which should be verifying these things during the process. Meanwhile, the persons who have perpetrated fraud upon the courts should be held accountable and face criminal charges. But the actions of a few bad apples shouldn’t be allowed to spoil the barrel for everyone. One may understand Google’s reticence in disclosing certain secrets. The company’s search engine algorithms, for example, are trade secrets. But the process and policies for evaluating legal requests are arguably an entirely different matter — a matter in which Google professes the desire for transparency by issuing regular “Transparency Reports.” To be fully transparent, Google ought to clearly communicate what criteria they will base their decisions upon. As one attorney specialized in defamation cases told Google, individuals can lose their businesses, their careers, and ultimately, their lives due to online reputation attacks. Yes, there are legitimate free speech issues that sometimes come into play, as well as the previously mentioned fraud against the courts, but the little guys with comparably far fewer resources are the underdog victims in need of advocates in this matter. US laws that allow many websites to distribute content without having the responsibility to remove defamation — specifically Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — have created a situation where many individuals and businesses are harmed, with zero recourse. There were reasonable means of obtaining relief via legal process prior to the growth of the internet which do not seem to have been preserved in the virtual space. Google’s policy of acting upon defamation removals in the past has been something of a relief-valve on the situation, but, now that it is undependable, it may create a groundswell of support for pushing some legislative or judicial adjustment. What should victims do now? As you can see from the descriptions of some cases outlined above, your situation may be very compelling, and it may be supported by a clean and valid legal process with clear-cut proof, but all that may not be sufficient to guarantee that Google will remove the links to defamatory content. If you’ve already been denied by Google in recent months, you may continue to periodically petition them to reconsider and try to provide any materials possible to demonstrate that you followed proper processes and have established the damaging material should not be allowed to stand. If you have not yet gone through a lawsuit to obtain a court order for defamatory content, you need to realize that your chances of success may be limited at this time if the content is posted on a site that will obstinately refuse to remove it. If you’re dealing with ISPs and websites that are not protected by Section 230, or which are directly responsible for the content, you might be able to get the stuff removed at the source and ask Google to update its crawl and remove the no-longer-existent URLs from search. It’s clear that this situation is still evolving. Defamation victims may still get relief through the legal process, and it may be worthwhile to start your journey toward getting a court order now, since litigation often requires months to get to the goal line, and there are statutes of limitation involved. Consult with your attorney to determine the relative merits and potential of success for your specific case. As this situation evolves, perhaps things will stabilize once more, one way or another. Until then, just realize that you are rolling the dice if you move forward with a suit. Some opinions expressed in this article may be those of a guest author and not necessarily Search Engine Land.

SEM account management: How to improve account performance In part two of his three-part series on SEM account management, contributor Ted Ives discusses how to keep your PPC campaigns running smoothly and performing well. Ted Ives on March 20, 2017 at 1:55 pm More Welcome to the second installment in my series on SEM account management. If you’re an SEM account manager and you’ve kept yourself from getting fired (see Part 1: How to avoid getting fired), you now have the opportunity and the time to focus on making your campaigns run like a top. Smoothly running and decently performing SEM campaigns require getting three things right: tracking, targeting and a good user experience. If you can master these three areas, your campaigns will “deliver the goods” and get you conversions at a decent cost per acquisition (CPA), or sales at a solid return on ad spend (ROAS). Tracking Tracking is everything. First, how can you spend thousands of dollars on your company’s behalf if you can’t track results to prove you were successful? Second, if you aren’t tracking results, then how can you optimize your campaigns by improving poor ads, favoring successful ads and using targeting methods such as keywords or demographic segments? Tracking is often overlooked or not properly maintained; without it, in the long run, most organizations will not allow you to have a budget. And if you can’t prove your results, you will get a reputation as a “bad steward.” If you’re using AdWords in combination with Google Analytics (GA), you have the luxury of using “autotagging,” where Google automatically appends a parameter with a string to all of your ads’ URLs. This unique string is a magical index number that allows GA and AdWords to look up dozens of pieces of information about the searcher’s click — city, browser, campaign, ad group, search term and so forth. It literally is a simple checkbox you enable (assuming you go through the multiple steps required to get GA to talk to AdWords as well, that’s a bit more of a challenge, as you need to set a few things on each end). If instead you’re using Facebook (or LinkedIn Ads, or any Display advertising platform), since those are not Google products, autotagging is not an option; instead you must append “utm” codes for Google Analytics to interpret, on the end of each URL. This is a bit of a pain but is crucial. If you do this, you can slice and dice by campaign, source and medium in Google Analytics, and you will be able to perform attribution analyses — deciding how much credit to give early-funnel clicks versus later-funnel clicks. Redirects There are numerous items that can cause tracking to fail and clicks to be credited instead to (not Set) in Google Analytics; we can’t cover all of them here, but the most common cause (other than neglecting to put tracking in place) is the presence of redirects. Let’s say, for instance, that your website is configured to have all URLs end in a slash. If you accidentally put into your creative’s destination URL a version of the destination page’s URL that is missing the required slash, often your web server will automatically redirect the searcher to the correct URL. Great, what’s the problem? The problem is often that many web servers will not preserve parameters on the end of a URL in the presence of redirects. So if, for instance, you have an AdWords autotagging parameter on the end of the URL — after it’s redirected — poof, your autotagging parameter is gone, and the keyword will show as (not set) in Google Analytics. Similarly, for Facebook, you can lose your utm parameters. So redirects are the bane of SEM account managers. Check for them, and fix your destination URLs. Targeting… and toilet seats I’m partial to AdWords, so I like to talk about keywords as targets, but all of this applies to Facebook and other channels, say, with demographic or remarketing target audiences. Regardless of the channel, if your campaign targeting is poor, results will be poor. For new SEM account managers, one of the most important things to get right is Google’s keyword “match types,” which define how searches will match against keywords. Defining a keyword with brackets, which represents exact match [nike shoes], will match on the query “nike shoes” but will not match on “blue nike shoes.” Phrase match with quotes “nike shoes” would match on both of those but would not match on “shoes nike.” Expanded broad match with pluses +nike +shoes would match on all of those but would not match on the related phrase “tennis shoes.” Using the keyword with no notation at all signifies broad match, e.g., nike shoes, which might match on all of those. Broad match is best to avoid where possible, although it can be useful as a method of keyword research, or if it’s used in combination with numerous negatives. Many new SEM account managers ignore match types and throw keywords into an account, not realizing the default is broad match. True story: I audited an AdWords account a few years back for an advertising agency (a classic case of the cobbler’s stepchild; I’ve worked with several ad agencies to help them get their own leads). This agency was bidding, broad match, on perfectly reasonable terms like “advertising agency,” “marketing companies” and so forth. I pulled a “search query report” from AdWords to see what actual searches had matched on their keywords, and — I’m not making this up — they had paid recently for a click on the search “toilet seat.” How that matched on one of these terms, I can’t say. So, if you don’t know what you’re doing, if you’re starting out, I recommend you use exact match and also the approach with the pluses. It allows the words to be in different orders and other words to be present, but it guarantees the words you have specified will be in the query. That should ensure you’re not bringing in anything too crazy. Running search query reports on a regular basis, and then adding negatives to the account, is crucial in order to maintain account performance. Google’s matching algorithms seem to drift and change over time, as do searchers’ interests, so you will always see new queries appearing. But a well-managed account, in my experience, should have no more than 0.5 percent to 2 percent “Wasted Spend.” Good user experience If you’re driving people somewhere, that somewhere had better be pretty compelling. Google understands this and has built features into AdWords to favor good searcher experiences, focusing in particular on landing page relevance, performance and quality. Landing page relevance Relevance and a great user experience are critical in order to get people to take action. User experience is linked closely to targeting; if you’re targeting people with a particular interest or intent, then they probably deserve a dedicated landing page that speaks to their issues and concerns. If you’re targeting 3,000 keywords, how can one landing page possibly satisfy a wide range of concerns? One rule of thumb, based on my field experience with several dozen clients over the years, is: have one landing page for every $1,000 of monthly spend. If you’re spending $500/month, then one landing page, or simply your site’s home page, or contact page, is probably adequate. If you’re spending $100,000/month, this rule of thumb suggests 100 landing pages. This can easily be achieved if your business is an e-commerce one where you’re sending people to multiple product pages; if you are doing lead generation with calls to action like “Download our free guide,” you should at least consider generating numerous landing page clones with different titles/copy on them. Landing page performance Performance is, in my opinion, about two things: the mobile experience and speed. Most landing pages look great on desktop, as that is where they were developed. But it’s critical to make sure that they are mobile-friendly. Many marketers are developing their landing pages as mobile-first, with the desktop version as the afterthought. Speed is also critical. Users have little patience and time, and Google, via its “Quality Score” mechanism, actually rewards you directly by discounting what you pay. Landing page load time is one component of Quality Score. Landing page quality Landing page quality means many things to many people, and there are numerous perspectives on this. Some things that can rapidly communicate quality to the viewer include endorsements/badges, the company’s name/address at the bottom of the screen and the presence or absence of a Privacy Policy and Terms of Service on the page. Note that of these, several of them are possible for Google to measure. I have had several clients who failed to have a Privacy Policy on their landing pages. Their quality scores (QS) all capped out at 8 out of 10; several weeks after they added a Privacy Policy, quality scores improved in their accounts across the board, and suddenly their top terms (i.e., brand, due to high CTR, which is rewarded with a high QS)  moved from 8 to 10. So, although it’s not an aspect explicitly documented anywhere by Google, I’m convinced having a Privacy Policy is a key Quality signal Google relies on. So, for landing pages, at a minimum, make sure: they load. there are no redirects. they are fast. they have a privacy policy. If you ensure these four things, you have a good shot at having your landing pages perform at least adequately, and you can then focus on usability and messaging to increase conversions. Conclusion If, as an SEM Account manager, you focus on putting in place — and checking and maintaining — tracking, targeting and a good user experience, then your campaigns have a very good chance of succeeding. Then you have a good chance of moving the ball forward for your company, and your own career. In Part 3, we’ll run over how to get more responsibility.

Twiggle offers plug-and-play semantic search to online retailers Company says its sophisticated search can be implemented without replacement of existing enterprise search. Greg Sterling on March 20, 2017 at 2:48 pm More Twiggle is a company founded by two former Google employees. It promises to bring “semantic search” to e-commerce sites with minimal technical integration. Udi Manber, formerly head of search at Google and Amazon’s A9, is a board member. Last week, the company released a “Semantic API,” which “gives retailers the ability to add a semantic layer to their existing search engines and interact with their online customers in a more personal and natural way.” The idea is that Twiggle will bring state-of-the-art search sophistication to companies that can’t develop the technology on their own. I spoke with Amir Konigsberg, CEO of Twiggle. He told me that his company spent three years building out an ontology that allows Twiggle to process and deeply understand billions of products and associated attributes. Twiggle also does data structuring and normalization and enhances products with additional metadata. Konigsberg critiques current e-commerce search capabilities as being very basic and not delivering an optimal user experience. Clicks and query matching are typically used to define relevance. He says that Twiggle doesn’t use clicks, it does semantic parsing to decipher queries and better understand them. It also allows for longer or more specialized queries. Perhaps more significantly, Konigsberg told me that Twiggle’s solution doesn’t require online retailers to replace their enterprise search infrastructure. The API passes each query in real time for Twiggle analysis. Konigsberg argues that Twiggle can process even the largest product catalog in a matter of hours and bring “Amazon-like search quality from day one.” Normally, it would take huge amounts of data to make comparable improvements in relevance. Konigsberg says with Twiggle’s ontology, sematic parsing and natural language processing (NLP), that’s no longer required. Assuming this is all accurate, it becomes especially significant in a mobile context, where users are less patient and forgiving. The structured data and semantic understanding would also shine in a voice search or virtual assistant context, where queries become more conversational and specific or elaborate. Konigsberg says, “[Our] NLP can support long and complex queries. You can be very descriptive.” He added, “We always get right [to] the product you’re looking for.” As evidence, he says that Twiggle delivers an average conversion rate lift of 18 percent to its customers.

Google: Hacked sites increased 32% in 2016 Google is encouraging webmasters and site owners to verify their sites in Google Search Console to help both prevent and fix website hacks. Barry Schwartz on March 20, 2017 at 1:11 pm More Google published its State of Website Security in 2016 today, reporting that there was a 32 percent increase in the number of hacked sites in 2016 compared to 2015. Google added that it doesn’t expect the trend to slow down any time soon. Google said that these hackers are getting even “more aggressive,” and at the same time more sites are letting their sites and content management systems become out of date, leaving themselves open to more security holes. As an incentive to verify your site with Google Search Console, one data point that is key is that “84% [of] webmasters who do apply for reconsideration are successful in cleaning their sites.” Of course, those that do take the time to verify their sites with Search Console are also more likely to care about their outdated CMS package. Google does try to warn all webmasters that their sites were hacked but said “61% of webmasters who were hacked never received a notification from Google that their site was infected because their sites weren’t verified in Search Console.” So verify your site; it is free and useful. Google then documented three common hacks and how to clean up such hacks: Gibberish Hack: The gibberish hack automatically creates many pages with non-sensical sentences filled with keywords on the target site. Hackers do this so the hacked pages show up in Google Search. Then, when people try to visit these pages, they’ll be redirected to an unrelated page, like a porn site. Learn more on how to fix this type of hack. Japanese Keywords Hack: The Japanese keywords hack typically creates new pages with Japanese text on the target site in randomly generated directory names. These pages are monetized using affiliate links to stores selling fake brand merchandise and then shown in Google search. Sometimes the accounts of the hackers get added in Search Console as site owners. Learn more on how to fix this type of hack. Cloaked Keywords Hack: The cloaked keywords and link hack automatically creates many pages with non-sensical sentence, links, and images. These pages sometimes contain basic template elements from the original site, so at first glance, the pages might look like normal parts of the target site until you read the content. In this type of attack, hackers usually use cloaking techniques to hide the malicious content and make the injected page appear as part of the original site or a 404 error page. Learn more on how to fix this type of hack. For more details, see the Google Webmaster blog.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Control What Happens To Your Social Media Accounts After You Die [Guide] Ammar Awais 3 days ago Our digital presence has become an integral part of our lives. Who can do without an email address or at least some social media activity, right? But have you ever given thought to what should happen to your accounts after you die? Definitely a tricky subject, but one worth preparing for! You need to ensure your accounts end up in the right hands after you pass on, especially if you have important data hidden away in your inbox and you want your heirs to have access to your emails. Here’s what you can do to ensure just that, considering specific company policies in this regard. Google You can add up to 10 individuals who will be notified if your Google accounts – including Gmail and Google Drive – have been inactive for a while. Your nominated friends and family members will be able to download data from your accounts for three months. To utilize this option, log in to your Google account, and set up your Inactive Account Manager. You will need to provide the following details. Your mobile number, and an optional email address Timeout period, which could be 3 months, 12 months, etc. Up to 10 ‘trusted contacts’ who will be notified if your account becomes inactive for the stated length of time The type of data to be shared with your contact(s) A typed email that will be sent to your contact(s) when your account expires Microsoft Microsoft email accounts include Hotmail, Live, Outlook, and MSN. Your family members will need to go through Microsoft’s ‘Next of Kin’ process to access your account data. To do so, your next of kin will need to send an email to msrecord@microsoft.com, providing proof of your death and their relationship to you. After verification, Microsoft will release your account data, including emails and address book, to your next of kin. Facebook Facebook allows you to select a ‘legacy contact’ who will be able to post a pinned post to your timeline, respond to friend requests, and update your profile picture. However, they cannot sign in to your account or see your private messages. Twitter Twitter’s policy does not allow anyone access to the deceased’s account. However, a close contact can request deactivation of the deceased’s account by using Twitter’s privacy form, which involves providing a copy of the death certificate. Instagram Close contacts can request the Instagram account of the deceased to be ‘memorialized’ by using this form. Memorialized accounts remain visible, but cannot be logged onto or changed. Password Managers As you can see, none of these platforms provide your heir with full access to your online account. So, if you want your trusted contacts to have unrestricted access to these after you die, then it’s best to use a password manager with a legacy feature, such as LastPass or Dashlane. These password managers let your contacts request access to your password vault and access is granted to them unless you restrict it within a certain period of time. via: cnet.com Photo credit: PBS Primary Sidebar Viral Stories airblue Gets Ahead with Youngest Aircraft Fleet in Pakistan TalentMyWay is a New Social Platform to Discover & Promote Talent On Pakistan Day, SastaTicket Offers 23% Discount on Hotels & Much More PTA Blocks Over 900 Web Addresses Belonging to Banned Organizations These Are the Top 10 Richest People in the World in 2017 LUMS to Hold Pakistan's First Ever UX Focused Conference Orient To Offer Free Giveaways For Its Customers This Pakistan Day Latest Today airblue Gets Ahead with Youngest Aircraft Fleet in Pakistan PIA Teases Emirates, Qatar and Etihad Airline First Global's Robotics Challange Comes to Pakistan Careem Celebrates Pakistan Day & Aspires to 'Make Pakistan Great Again' Bank Alfalah Launches PayPak Debit Card JazzCash Doubles its Active Mobile Accounts to 2 Million Here is the Traffic Plan for 23rd March Parade in Islamabad & Rawalpindi Home Contact Us Privacy Policy Mobile Packages Mobile Prices © 2016 Copyright Propakistani.pk

SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube. Photo: Chris Ratcliffe Britain is the largest market for Alphabet’s Google outside the United States, generating US$7.8 billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly 9 per cent of the US giant’s global revenue.”I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content,” Google EMEA president Matt Brittin said at the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London.Besides well-known British brands pulling the plug, some of the world’s biggest advertising companies responsible for placing vast amounts of marketing material for clients, said they were reviewing how they worked with Google.The boycott is the latest clash between advertising companies and the internet giants that have built up dominant positions in digital advertising by offering not only huge audiences but also the ability to apply their user data to make ads more targeted and relevant. Advertisement For big advertising groups such as WPP, internet firms are both a client and a competitor, while traditional media groups such as newspapers and general online news publishers are having to compete with them for online dollars.”Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe … and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings,” said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group.”Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem,” he said.WPP, the world’s largest advertising firm, said on Monday it was talking to clients and media partners such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished.”We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company.

While Google’s latest Android Nougat update is still slowly arriving for most, some are ready for what’s next. After rumors earlier this month it’s now available for select few as a very limited early developer preview, or beta. Here’s what’s new, where to get it right now and everything you need to know. The annual Google I/O developer event is coming up quick, and Android O will likely take center stage. Over the past few years Google’s used their even to showcase new versions of Android, and we can expect the same this year. Android O will be approaching the second beta release by then. Read: Google Pixel XL Review: A New Breed of Android Last year Android N was announced and released as a limited preview in March. Ahead of Google I/O. Just as expected, the same thing has happened for Android O. It comes with some neat new changes to icons, notifications, battery life and much more. Read on for the current changelog, what’s new and how to get it right now. After rumors earlier this week Google has made it official. Android O is here, albeit a very early preview that isn’t for daily use. We know the next version of Android will be called Android O at first, then later get a name. Google names each version in alphabetical order and after tasty treats. Like Android 4.4 KitKat, Android 5.0 Lollipop, Marshmallow, and now Android 7.0 Nougat. Next is Android O, and some Google employees have even started teasing it will be called Oreo. We’ll have to wait and see. That isn’t important though. It’s the changes, improvements and new features most will likely appreciate. I’m looking forward to Android 9.0 Pistachio, or Peanut Brittle. Android O Developer Preview Available First things first, when can you get Android O? Well, right now apparently. As long as you have the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Google Pixel, Pixel XL or Pixel C tablet. Older devices are no longer allowed in the beta. As usual Google is allowing developers or those daring enough to try, the option to get it today. Simply click below to get started. Download Android O (click here) Google notes (more so than usual) that this is an extremely early first version preview, and not stable enough for daily use. There are bugs, issues, and battery life could be worse. Even though the final version of Android O will severely improve battery life with a new restrictive app mode. Those with eligible devices can download the factory images and flash the Android O Developer Preview starting today. However, it is not a part of the current Android Beta program, so over the air updates won’t be possible. At least not yet. Meaning anyone interested will need to completely wipe out their device, and start fresh with O. What’s New in Android O Considering this is a very early developer preview, and not anywhere near the final release, nothing is final. Similar to 2016 with Android N things are subject to change, evolve, or be removed completely by the time it’s actually released to the public. That being said, here are some of the changes we’re seeing already. Background Limits: A power saving feature in addition to “Doze” that will restrict app battery usage while in the background based on priority. (Some apps may need to reload when you re-open them) More info here. Auto-Fill: Just like how our web browsers on desktops and mobile auto-fill information like email or physical addresses, we will now be able to do this in apps. Android O brings auto-fill in a more advanced method to the entire OS. Adaptive Icons & Badges: At-a-glance notification number bubbles or information right on home screen app icon badges. Similar to iOS. Not to mention adaptive icons. Imagine the clock icon always showing the right time, calendar showing the date, etc. Not to mention neat animations. Notification Channels: Our notification system is changing a little bit again, for the better. Bundled notifications thanks to a new API will let developers have more control of how and what we get from notifications. Not to mention grouped notifications, and a smarter order in which they’re displayed. We could see cross-device sync later too. More details here. Picture-in-Picture Mode: Android TV has PIP mode with Nougat, and now all Android will have it with Android O. This is picture-in-picture video. Imagine watching Netflix and YouTube at the same time. Yes please. There is also support for multi-displays. So watch something on a phone and cast another stream at the same time. Wide-gamut color for apps: Android developers can now take advantage of new devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display. Like the Galaxy S8. Apps will be more colorful and amazing. Keyboard Navigation: We already have this to some extent in Android Nougat, and it will be better in O. Audio Improvements: New low-latency audio, Bluetooth aptX, and other things. And Much More This is just a small list of some of the highlight changes coming with Android O. Although we can expect a lot more in the near future. There are also Java 8 APIs, improvements to webview, WiFi NAN, telephone framework tweaks, and other things. Stay tuned for more details. This is all just developing. Android O Feature Rumors More Google Assistant: Now that the Google Assistant works with all new Android devices, expect tons of new smart features and controls. Smart Text Selection: Also being called “Copy Less” where text selection for copy/paste, addresses, phone numbers and more can be saved and moved by the Google Assistant automatically. Or just be better than the current copy/paste method. (Could be coming in a second beta release) Gestures & Moves: Many devices have gestures, and the Google Pixel has “Moves”. Like swiping down on the fingerprint scanner to pull down the notification bar. Or drawing a C in the screen to instantly launch the camera. More Coming Soon Android O Release Date & Updates So when will Android O be released? Well, that’s anyone’s guess at this point. Last year Google unveiled N in March as a developer preview, and it wasn’t officially released until late August. According to the official announcement today there will be four Android O developer preview betas released. Preview 2 will arrive in late May (around Google IO) then we can expect a third release in June. Then likely the final and fourth sometime in August before the global and official release date for all. That should be in Q3 according to Google. That all said, Google I/O will take place this year on May 17th until May 19th. Giving developers and Android users three days worth of information. We may not see or hear anything further on Android O until the second beta is released during or right before Google IO. Expect more features and other changes at that time. Keep in mind though, this is only a beta for select developers and early adopters. The global release for all devices and manufacturers won’t be until later in the year. Google said Q3, but it will likely be around September. Then companies like Samsung will start working on updates, which will probably arrive sometime in early 2018. As soon as we know more we’ll update with all of the details. While you’re here see what changed with Android N, then compare to some of the changes mentioned above with Android O. Read: Android Nougat vs Android 6.0 Marshmallow Walkthrough: What’s New What Devices Will Get Android O? Any device released within the past two years or so should technically be capable of getting the update to Android O when it’s released. Manufacturers are required to support a device for at least 18-months from the day it’s released to the public. So like the Galaxy S6, up to the most recent LG G6. However, which devices will get it first is important. Google does what’s called a Developer Preview, or a beta where millions get early access. For now it’s limited to the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, Pixel XL and Pixel C tablet. No Nexus 5 or Nexus 5, as this is the end of the line for them. They will probably stay on Nougat, but still receive security patches. Additionally, most other device owners will need to wait for betas from those companies, or the global release date later this year. Final Thoughts In closing, this is all we know thus far. Google literally just announce the Android O beta, and things will change a lot in the coming months. Some of the features in the beta may not be in the final release, and others will change. We saw this last year, and expect it again. However, it’s nice to know we can expect three updates to Android O, and four developer preview betas in total. Then, sometime later this year the new operating system will be ready for a global release for any and all smartphones. Expect it to launch on the new Google Pixel 2, or something like the LG V30.

Contents 1 History 2 Prefs 3 Documentation 4 Engineering 4.1 Code walkthrough 5 QA 6 Telemetry 7 Links History Google Safe Browsing was an anti-phishing extension released by Google on labs.google.com in December 2005. Google has released this extension to the Mozilla Foundation under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 in order that it might be used as part of Firefox if desired. We've landed this change on the trunk as a global extension as of 7 March 2006. You can read the discussion that lead up to to its integration in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329292 Google started migrating their Safe Browsing to version 4 of the protocol in 2015. We are currently working on integrating V4 in our code base with a incremental approach. That is, we will be landing V4 patches progressively and leave the V2 stack up and running until the V4 is extensively tested and the Shavar server has been upgraded to V4. In other words, V2 and V4 will co-exist for a while to ensure we don't break Safe Browsing. See the V4 implementation plan for the milestones and bugs involved.

Ivor Bennett reports ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript For companies like Marks and Spencer, YouTube is a vital advertising platform. But it's not one it'll be using anytime soon. The British retailer is the latest company to pull its advertising from Google's platforms after other firms' campaigns appeared alongside videos carrying extremist content. Speaking at an advertising conference in London, Google's European chief made this apology. SOUNDBITE (English) MATT BRITTIN, EMEA PRESIDENT, GOOGLE, SAYING: "So I want to start by saying sorry. You know, we apologise. When anything like that happens, we don't want it to happen, you don't want it to happen, and we take responsibility for it." The problem is, it was happening quite a lot. L'Oreal's campaign with actress Helen Mirren was the first to be noticed. The Times newspaper reporting it appeared alongside preaching videos by Steven Anderson. The American pastor who notoriously praised the shooting spree at a gay nightclub in Florida last year. This Guardian advert was spotted on a post by far-right group Britain First. While the videos of former KKK leader David Duke reportedly carried advertising by the Royal Navy. For every 1000 clicks an advert generates, around 6 pounds goes to the video's host meaning the brands were effectively financing extremists. SOUNDBITE (English) MATT BRITTIN, EMEA PRESIDENT, GOOGLE, SAYING: "In general what we've found is that it's been a handful of impressions and pennies not pounds. But however small or big the issue, we need to improve and we need to get better." The company's said it's reviewing its policy on video monetisation to more clearly define inflammatory content, and simplify the controls advertisers can have on where their material appears.

Google Celebrates the Equinox with Two Doodles for the Changing Seasons GO Google's new doodles bring in a cute mouse Mar 20, 2017 21:41 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  The new season is finally here, and Google is celebrating with a pair of new doodles to match the weather, depending on where you live.  Today is the first day of spring for people living in the Northern Hemisphere and the first day of fall in the Southern Hemisphere. To mark the special occasion, Google is showing off two different doodles. As you know, March 20 marks the equinox, which marks the day in the year when the day is equal in length to the night, both lasting 12 hours. "We use the equinox to mark the change of seasons, as the balance of light shifts to make for longer days or nights. It usually means that it's time to time to rise and shine for warmer seasons, or hunker down for colder ones, as in the case of our furry friend the mouse! You may also notice that on the equinox, the sun rises directly in the east and sets directly in the west, whereas at other times in the year, it appears off-center if you're facing those directions. Today, we mark the equinox with a Doodle to celebrate the changing seasons," reads Google's description of the doodles. One mouse, two scenarios  Since the seasons are opposite depending on what side of the equator you live, folks in the North are finally getting some warm weather with the spring approaching, while folks in the South are enjoying some cooling down with the fall approaching fast. The Google doodle for the Northern Hemisphere shows a cute mouse in its undergrown burrow waking up for the day, going out into a field of flowers and picking up one. It then brings a daffodil inside its home, puts it in water and returns to take a much-needed nap after putting in so much effort. The doodle for the Southern Hemisphere shows the same little mouse in its cute burrow, but this time there are no more colorful flowers. Instead, above the ground, there are loads of orange leafs which the mouse runs through, wrapped up in a warm scarf. A hot cup of tea and some wheat complete the fall atmosphere.

Where the Pixel phones have had early access to things like Google Assistant and to new software versions, the Pixel C has been treated like a Nexus ─ that’s to say kept up to date but not given any preferential treatment. However, that has seemingly changed today… The best gifts for Android users In the latest beta version of Android 7.1.2, Google has quietly made some massive changes to the software on the Pixel C that line it up much closer with what you’d see on the Pixel or Pixel XL. First, the navigation buttons have been changed to the all-white version seen on the Pixel phone, although the home button is a solid circle here since Assistant isn’t supported on tablets. The settings menu has also been updated with the blue color scheme seen on Google’s phones. Along with that, the Pixel Launcher is now installed as a system app and has seemingly been further optimized for tablets compared to older versions of the launcher. Just like on the phone, the Pixel Launcher on the Pixel C offers the swipe-up style app drawer and the weather/date widget in the top corner. Lastly and by far the most interesting change, though, is the new multi-tasking menu. Rather than being a slightly different version of what you’d see on a phone, Google has completely swapped out this menu for a grid-based system that takes advantage of all the extra screen real-estate (if you ask me, it looks pretty Andromeda-dy). There are also some fancy new animations on that menu, especially obvious when using the quick switch feature. Unfortunately, though, this new menu is limited to only 8 apps with no scrolling features. Hopefully, that’s something that can be ironed out before the final launch.

It's a snap to set up and has more range and power than almost any other router. The Orbi's dedicated channel for router-to-extension data traffic helps the system squeeze the maximum throughput for your family's online wants and needs. Starting at $400 for a two-pack kit (or $250 for the base router alone), this is among the most expensive home Wi-Fi kits. But if you have a lot of ground to cover, the premium is well worth it. That's why we're adding the Orbi to our list of Best Wi-Fi Routers. Costs and What's Covered The two-pack kit starts at $400 and is rated to cover 5,000 square feet. An extra satellite costs $250 and adds another 2,000 square feet of coverage; the router by itself also goes for $250 and covers 2,000 square feet. (As of this writing, Costco has an exclusive $450 deal on an Orbi three-pack.) Credit: Netgear None of the other mesh-router systems on the market cost quite as much. Google Wifi costs $299 for three units, while Eero and Luma three packs each cost $400. The Linksys Velop system, possibly the closest match to the Orbi, runs $500 for a three-pack, but you can get two units for $350. However, the Orbi claims greater per-unit area coverage than any of these. Two other mesh-router systems, the $300 two-piece Amped Wireless Ally Plus and the $350 three-piece Ubiquiti AmpliFi HD, claim coverage areas of a whopping 15,000 square feet and 20,000 square feet, respectively. We're working to confirm those numbers in our lab tests. Design Instead of tiny easy-to-stash devices, which you get with the Luma and Google Wifi, the oval-cross-sectioned Netgear Orbi host and extensions are big towers, measuring 8.9 inches x 6.7 inches x 3.1 inches. You can put one in a bookshelf and use it as a bookend, but each Orbi unit is too huge to easily hide. Credit: Netgear Like Google Wifi, the Orbi units have color-coded LEDs. When an Orbi device glows white around the oval on top, it's starting up. When it's blue, everything is OK. But if it glows amber, your internet connection is weak; if it's magenta, your connection is gone. MORE: Best Wi-Fi Routers The Orbi transmits Wi-Fi data on three radio-frequency bands. The primary 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz radios provide a theoretical peak throughput of 1.2Gbps of data flow to user devices. There's a twist, though: Netgear adds a second 5-GHz, 1.7Gbps radio that's exclusively dedicated to the backhaul, the data being transmitted from the router Orbi unit to the satellite Orbis and back again. Because of this side channel, the main links between the Orbi units and your devices stay strong and fast. To support this configuration, each Orbi device has six high-performance amplified antennas around its perimeter. There's also a Bluetooth radio and antenna, but they're dormant for now. Although they look the same, the Orbi's router unit and satellite units are not interchangeable. You can't randomly decide which unit should be the router and which should be the repeater. The router can handle up to three satellites, but each satellite communicates directly with the host router in a hub-and-spoke arrangement, rather than in a true mesh topology that would let data pass from one satellite to another. (A Netgear representative told us the company was working on a firmware update that would enable satellite-to-satellite communication.) Credit: Netgear Each Orbi's backside has a power input, an on/off button and four gigabit Ethernet ports. On the router, one port is yellow and connects to your broadband modem. You can use the other LAN ports to connect to printers, network-attached storage drives and stationary PCs. There are also buttons to reset a device and to synchronize the router with extra satellites. (Orbi units sold in packs come out of the box synchronized.) Each Orbi sports a USB 2.0 port as well, but, like the Bluetooth radios, they're awaiting activation by a future software update. Performance Like Google Wifi, the Orbi is a 2x2 router, and can handle two simultaneous streams of data to properly configured devices, per frequency band. (The dedicated backhaul channel uses 4x4 radios.) But the Orbi adds the latest MU-MIMO (multi-user, multiple input and multiple output) Wi-Fi technology for sending focused data streams to several devices at the same time. With the Orbi router 30 feet and two walls away, the Orbi extension projected 429.1 Mbps to a laptop one floor above it — more than double Google Wifi's performance. Each Orbi device has Qualcomm's IPQ4019 Wi-Fi control chip and radio as well as a 710-MHz quad-core ARM-based processor with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of solid-state storage space. A QCA9984 chip controls the backhaul data channel. MORE: Best Wi-Fi Extenders Make no mistake about it: All of this makes the Orbi a powerful beast. Using IxChariot software, Purch Labs' real-world testing showed that a single Orbi router could deliver a combined average throughput of 552.1 megabits per second (Mbps) at 5 feet. It was 19 percent faster at this distance than Google Wifi, 34 percent faster than the Linksys Velop and 50 percent faster than the Ubiquiti AmpliFi HD. Router Performance Compared (in Mbps)*   AmpliFi HD Google Wifi Linksys Velop Netgear Orbi 5 feet 368.17 464.36 412.34 552.11 15 feet 377.73 +2.6% 440.90 -5.1% 527.10 +30% 510.90 -7.5% 50 feet 350.83 -4.7% 389.74 -16% 459.35 +11% 447.13 -19% 100 feet 293.82 -20% 227.22 -51% 330.06 -20% 371.42 -33% 150 feet 230.86 -37% 33.79 -93% 288.42 -30% 229.07 -58% * Line-of-sight testing with a single router point. Percentages indicate change from 5-foot measurement on same device. The Orbi's performance dropped off with distance, but not as rapidly as the Google Wifi's. The throughput averaged 510.9 Mbps at 15 feet, 447.1 Mbps at 50 feet and 371.4 Mbps at 100 feet. To put this in perspective, the Orbi's 100-foot throughput was about the same as the Ubiquiti AmpliFi HD's 15-foot speed. The Linksys Velop averaged more power at long range, but its test results were less consistent than the Orbi's. (These distance tests were conducted along a line of sight.) Netgear Orbi Distance Falloff* Credit: Purch Labs * Decrease in throughput (vertical axis, in Mbps) per distance (horizontal axis, in feet). The Orbi has a smooth falloff, and its results over five test runs (thinner lines) were very consistent. At 150 feet, the Orbi router still delivered 229.1 Mbps of throughput, nearly seven times Google Wifi's 33.8 Mbps. (To be fair, the AmpliFi HD had very similar throughput at 150 feet, and the Velop had 26 percent more.) With such results, the Orbi's claim of 2,000 square feet of coverage per unit might be an underestimation. In the Purch Labs material-penetration tests, the Orbi router's transmissions were powerful enough to punch through a metal-frame wall, a ceiling and a soundboarded wall with little drop-off. (The soundboard figure actually improved throughput by about 8 percent; we're not including regular drywall because it has little effect.) Google Wifi and the AmpliFi HD had losses of even smaller percentages when penetrating walls and ceilings, but the Orbi's better starting point put it ahead overall. Data Penetration Compared (in Mbps)*   AmpliFi HD Google Wifi Linksys Velop Netgear Orbi Metal 343.45 -9.1% 396.39 -10% 559.95 +6.2% 455.70 -11% Soundboard 369.51 -2.2% 402.55 -8.7% 381.66 -28% 549.99 +7.7% Ceiling 390.21 +3.3% 425.2 -3.6% 67.80 -87% 424.12 -17% *Throughput from a single router point passing through ceiling and walls of different compositions. Percentages indicate change from 15-foot line-of-sight measurement. In a 100-foot, single-line test, placing the Orbi extension halfway between the router and the Purch Labs laptop boosted throughput by 28 percent. By contrast, the Velop's throughput stayed about the same, while the AmpliFi HD's and Google Wifi's throughputs dropped about 25 percent each. Again, in absolute terms, the Orbi's overall speed advantage blew away the competition. Single-Line Extension Hop Test (in Mbps)*   AmpliFi HD Google Wifi Linksys Velop Netgear Orbi Single Hop (100 feet) 219.93 -25% 175.57 -23% 331.62 +0.5% 475.87 +28% Double Hop (150 feet) n/a 128.90 +282% 223.22 -23% n/a *Extensions placed every 50 feet between router and endpoint. Percentages indicate change from line-of-sight tests at same distances without extensions. The Orbi also did well in complicated, 3D tests, with results very similar to the Linksys Velop's. With the router 30 feet and two walls away, the Orbi extension projected 429.1 Mbps to a laptop one floor above it — more than double Google Wifi's average, and two and a half times more than with the Orbi router alone. Moving the laptop further away decreased the throughput, but the Orbi extension helped greatly. 3D Extension Hop Tests (in Mbps)*   AmpliFi HD Google Wifi Linksys Velop Netgear Orbi 30 feet thru 2 walls (point A to point B) 393.32 251.09 371.03 333.64 33 feet thru wall, ceiling (A to point C) 192.47 36.75 121.81 119.99 48 feet thru 2 walls, ceiling (A to point D) 99.72 4.42 40.29 47.35 One hop, 45 feet thru ceiling, 2 walls (A to B to C) 202.08 +5.0% 189.92 +417% 427.00 +250 429.13 +258% One hop, 68 feet thru ceiling, 4 walls (A to B to D) 158.01 +58% 73.23 +1,557% 332.79 +726% 245.66 +419% Two hops, 80 feet thru ceiling, 4 walls (A to B to C to D) n/a 56.63 +1,181% 145.41 +261% n/a *First three tests involve direct router-to-client communication, with client laptop moving to new rooms and floors. Second three tests add extensions to same configurations. Percentages indicate change in data throughput between two sets. In a three-story home with lots of thick walls, the Orbi stayed connected with client devices as far as 125 feet from the router. That's the best score we've seen among recent routers, and was 20 feet and 35 feet farther than the Google Wifi and AmpliFi HD routers managed, respectively. Signal Strength, Router Only Orbi router (star) placed in corner of Purch Labs floor. Red is strongest, blue is weakest. Credit: Purch Labs The Orbi network easily covered a 3,500-square foot home; with the router placed in the basement and the extension on the main floor, the signal easily reached to the top floor. The Speedtest.net broadband test pegged the Orbi as delivering between 50 Mbps and 95 Mbps of download speed from a 100-Mbps broadband connection. Signal Strength, Router and Extension Orbi extension (circle) added. Red is strongest, blue weakest. Credit: Purch Labs With its MU-MIMO technology, the Orbi served several devices simultaneously. It stood up well to our informal saturation test, in which we played videos on Surface Pro 3 and iPad Pro tablets as a Samsung Tab Pro S moved data on and off a network-attached storage system and a MacBook Air played an online radio station. The video and audio came through on all devices without a skip, stutter or drop-out. Setup, Warranty and Support Netgear has taken the lead in the race to create a home Wi-Fi network system that all but sets itself up. The devices come pre-paired, and the installation doesn't require knowledge of IP addresses, Ethernet or encryption. You don't even need to install a mobile app. Setup can be done using a PC or Mac connected via Ethernet to the Orbi router, or via a smartphone or tablet connected via Wi-Fi. Just type orbilogin.com into a computer web browser, or download the Orbi app for iOS or Android. You can also use the Netgear Genie app, which is available for Windows and Mac as well as Android and iOS. Netgear has taken the lead in the race to create a home Wi-Fi network system that all but sets itself up. After Orbi's software does a network check, the router will be set up. Power up the Orbi satellite in the place where you want it to stay, and let the router scan for it. You may have to move the satellite closer to the router. Credit: Brian Nadel/Tom's Guide Then change the network name, access the password and administrative passwords (you'll absolutely want to do this for security's sake), and restart the devices. It took us 10 minutes to create a fully operating network that filled a suburban house with Wi-Fi. MORE: What Is a Mesh Router, and Do You Need One? Netgear includes a one-year warranty for the Orbi system, but only three months of tech support. The Orbi support section on Netgear's website includes not only startup tips and videos, but also  a downloadable manual that explains everything you can do with the Orbi. Netgear has technicians standing by 24 hours a day to help with a phone call, online chat or email. You can also connect with the help desk through the mobile app. Customization All the Orbi mobile-app screens use portrait mode, and the app's functions are limited to the basics, without even a network-speed monitor. (Netgear told us that it will soon add more capabilities to the Orbi app.) For more fine-grained control and diagnostic information, you'll have to use the desktop browser local interface or the Netgear Genie software, which applies to many Netgear routers but has many more features than the embryonic Orbi app. The Orbi app Dashboard shows the network name and password, but you can obscure the password. The Device Info screen shows the router's firmware version, but to update the firmware, you'll need to go to the bottom of the main Dashboard page. By contrast, the browser interface is more detailed, with a network speed and usage monitor. It also lets you set up a guest network so that visitors can access the internet from their laptops or smartphones without using your main network's access password. (Some security experts recommend putting smart-home devices on the guest network as well.) Credit: Brian Nadel/Tom's Guide You can also do more-technical things, such as adjust the router's maximum transmission unit, perform port forwarding and configure IPV6 addressing, but you can't adjust the Orbi's transmission strength or channel width. Nor can you assign static IP addresses, although the Orbi supports DHCP IP address reservations. Smart-Home Integration Since the Orbi first shipped early in 2017, a firmware update has added Amazon Alexa compatibility. To use Alexa, you'll need to create a Netgear account and install the Netgear Genie mobile app on a smartphone or tablet. For now, Alexa commands are limited to turning the guest network on and off, rebooting the router, and reading out the Wi-Fi settings. (Alexa does not yet work with Netgear's line of Arlo security cameras.) Security and Parental Controls The Orbi ships with a semi-random network name and a unique alphanumeric administrative passcode that should be safe enough to use during the short setup routine. Still, you should change both the name and code to something more personal as soon as possible. While the Orbi apps don't let you quickly pause the internet connection for dinner or family time, you can do so with the browser interface or the Genie app. (Netgear engineers are working on adding this ability to the Orbi apps.) Credit: Brian Nadel/Tom's GuideTo make the most of Orbi's parental controls, you should use the Netgear Genie app for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, and create an OpenDNS account. That way, you can choose to block specific websites or let Netgear take care of the details by adjusting the overall filtering level between none and high. The Orbi uses the WPA2 security standard to encrypt Wi-Fi transmissions and protect your data and network, and supports the somewhat weaker WPA standard. (The old WEP standard is not supported, so you won't be able to connect some PCs that were made before 2005.) MORE: Your Router's Security Stinks. Here's How to Fix It We aren't thrilled that the Orbi supports the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) configuration protocol, which is anything but protected. But WPS does let people uncomfortable with mobile apps and passwords set up and use an Orbi system just by pressing a few buttons. Like most mesh-router systems, the Orbi automatically updates its own firmware. (Netgear told us that the updates are encrypted and verified.) Few standard routers do this, which leaves them vulnerable to attackers, so it's good to see this trend. Bottom Line Netgear's Orbi blasts off with not only the best-performing Wi-Fi router-extenders kit, but also the easiest setup. The Orbi's dedicated mobile apps are rudimentary, but both the browser-based interface and Netgear's generic Genie app have more options. It's expensive, and its security could use some improvement, but for now, the Orbi is the mesh router to beat.

(Photo: Ben Margot / AP) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE San Francisco — Before Donald Trump’s election, Laurence Berland viewed political protest as a sort of curiosity. He was in a good place to see it: San Francisco’s Mission District, once an immigrant enclave in the country’s heartland of radicalism that is increasingly populated by people like him — successful tech workers driving up rents while enjoying a daily commute to Silicon Valley on luxury motor coaches. Berland regarded the activism of his adopted city with a mix of empathy and bemusement, checking out Occupy Wall Street demonstrations and protests against the gentrification of his own neighborhood. But now there is less distance between him and activists on the street. On a recent day Berland stood with about 100 others — from software engineers like himself to those who work in tech company cafeterias — outside a downtown museum for a rally against President Trump. “Everyone come closer! We’re going to practice some chanting, and we’re going to get to know each other,” called a woman wearing a union T-shirt with a bullhorn pressed to her lips. The crowd closed in around a banner reading “Workers in Tech Say No Ban No Wall.” A clipboard-carrying organizer approached Berland to ask if he wanted to join a network of grassroots activists, but Berland waved him away. He had already signed up. In the place that fought against the Vietnam War and for gay rights and, more recently, has been roiled by dissent over the technology industry’s impact on economic inequality, an unlikely alliance has formed in the left’s resistance against Trump. Old-school, anti-capitalist activists and new-school, free-enterprise techies are pushing aside their differences to take on a common foe. For years, these two strands of liberal America have been at each other’s throats. There’ve been protests against evictions of those who can’t afford the Bay Area’s ever-soaring rents. And think back, not so long ago, to the raucous rallies to block those fancy buses shuttling tech workers from city neighborhoods to the Silicon Valley campuses of Yahoo, Facebook, Apple and Google, where Berland once worked. Cat Brooks, a Black Lives Matter activist in Oakland, has seen the toll the tech industry has taken on some. Her daughter’s elementary school teacher just moved to a distant suburb after her rent skyrocketed, and Brooks thinks more tech money must find its way into local communities. She nevertheless welcomes the infusion of new energy to the protest arena. “It’s not about the business of we were here first,” Brooks said. “We’re about the business of how can we support? Division at this time is not helpful.” Such improbable partnerships scramble the historical protest model that used to pit working-class people against everyone else, said Rory McVeigh, director of the Center for the Study of Social Movements at the University of Notre Dame. “There are new cleavages that can produce alliances that weren’t possible before,” McVeigh said. “When you feel all of you are being threatened but in different ways … trade-offs are minimized. You realize at times such as that that you need allies more than ever before.” If all politics is personal, as the saying goes, the moment it got personal for the tech industry was when the Trump administration imposed its initial travel ban on immigrants and refugees from seven majority Muslim nations. The industry prides itself on its openness to immigrants, who comprise about one-quarter of the U.S. technology and science workforce and include the founders of iconic institutions. Nearly 100 tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Uber, filed a court brief urging suspension of the ban, while Google co-founder Sergey Brin, a Russian immigrant, joined protests at San Francisco International Airport. That was followed by an unprecedented companywide walkout at Google . “People in Silicon Valley, it’s really hard to get them excited about things that aren’t technical,” said Anita Rosen, a technology project manager who has started an activist group in the Valley suburb of Mountain View. “But everything that Trump says is the opposite of what we believe. He hates technology. He hates foreigners.” The morning after the election, Jesse Pickard convened the daily meeting at the technology firm he runs, Elevate. He could see the fear and heartbreak in the faces of his staff of 21, some of whom are legal immigrants. He tried to inspire them to fight for all the things that made them first fall in love with the United States. Then he set about doing that himself. Pickard wondered if the door-knocking he’d done for Hillary Clinton had been the right use of his talents. “I didn’t feel I was having the impact I could have if I was meaningfully using my design skills,” he said. And so Pickard launched DeBug Politics, a series of hackathons where teams of software engineers create apps to fight Trump and get more people involved in politics. Winning products include a Chrome browser extension that points viewers to news that doesn’t match their ideological viewpoint, and a tool that allows people to urge followers on social media to contact elected representatives. Pickard’s company is based out of a three-story converted brewery in San Francisco’s trendy South of Market district. Sitting at a picnic table on the rooftop deck, where the company chef sometimes serves employees lunch and dinner, Pickard acknowledged that tech workers generally had a protected life. “Prior to the election … you didn’t have a lot to worry about if you got a six-figure job right out of school and got catered lunches every day,” he said. “They had all these left-leaning and progressive opinions, but they didn’t feel like they had to fight very much.” He’s been to a couple of demonstrations — his first in years — but Pickard thinks he can make more of an impact through technology. Ka-Ping Yee feels the same. Yee moved to the Bay Area from Canada in 1998, earned his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, and landed a job as a software engineer in Google’s philanthropic unit in 2007. Now he works at a startup to help immigrants send cash home. Though he’s rarely been to a protest, the 40-year-old Yee sees himself as a kindred spirit with his leftist neighbors. “I do sympathize with a lot of the goals and the values behind these protests,” he said, “but have focused my effort on work.” Part of that work has been creating an online pledge, signed by thousands of technology workers, against building databases for any potential Muslim registries or to aid deportations of immigrants. Yee is a Canadian citizen, though he is a legal permanent resident of this country, and he’s been shocked at having to think about a contingency plan should life in the U.S. become impossible. “People whose pedigree is knocking on doors and calling representatives and waving signs are getting together with people who design apps,” Yee said. “People are working with people who do really, really different things because they realize it’s an emergency.” Veteran activists said they are heartened by the civil awakening among tech workers. Debra Cleaver runs VOTE.org, which tries to make absentee voting easier with online tools. She said the greatest help may be tech companies using their copious coffers to fund legal challenges or otherwise fight back. Google, for example, created a $4 million crisis fund to help those affected by Trump’s travel ban. However, Cleaver cautioned against efforts to “engineer” a way around the effects of Trump policies. “I’m sure they’re all trying” to design new apps and systems to fight Trump, she said, “and they’re going to find out that tech can’t solve this problem.” Others aren’t so sure about sharing the streets because they don’t think they share the same ultimate goals. Franki Velez, an Iraq War veteran on disability, stood outside an Oakland rental office recently with other longtime activists and renters fighting eviction. There was not a technology worker in sight, and she worried that they are missing the point anyway. They want to change, but preserve, a system that’s benefited them, she said, while protesters like her want to tear the system down and start from scratch. “They don’t understand it’s a colonial system that’s never meant to be reformed,” she said. Still, while their approaches can be strikingly different, Velez’s causes are increasingly being adopted by people not like her. Velez’s group marched to a Wells Fargo branch to hand over a demand that the bank stop investing in the Dakota Access Pipeline. Two hours later, in the comfortable Silicon Valley suburb of Campbell, biotech executive Michael Clark drew cheers after telling a gathering of anti-Trump activists that he’d closed his Wells Fargo account to protest the pipeline. Clark grew up in New Hampshire and then in Silicon Valley, when his mother took a job at Apple in the 1990s. He always considered himself a political independent, a moderate. But Trump’s election horrified him and, with a friend who runs a gourmet chocolate shop, he founded a chapter of the national liberal group “Indivisible” in Campbell. “The country has moved so much to the right that puts me in the middle with people I wouldn’t have previously been aligned with,” Clark said. “It’s interesting that someone like me is on the same side as a lot of socialists.” The two worlds don’t always intersect, but when they do it can verge on the surreal. At the anti-Trump protest Laurence Berland attended outside the Children’s Creativity Museum, union leaders railed against the president, as did immigrant cafeteria workers in Spanish. Dana Sniezko, a veteran of local progressive causes who had worried the city was losing its radical edge amid tech-driven yuppie-ization, passed out homemade stickers reading “Resist” and said: “I think San Francisco is waking up.” Passers-by stopped and stared. A handful wearing tags that showed they were in town for a cryptography conference flashed a thumbs-up. Praveen Sinha, a cryptographer who works at a Silicon Valley digital security firm, began to address the crowd. Sinha, who was born in the U.S., has long been active in liberal causes but despaired that many of his immigrant colleagues were afraid to protest for fear of encountering problems with the Trump administration in the future. “We’re all in the same boat here,” he told the crowd, bemoaning how Trump was playing on racism to deny people from around the world the chance to contribute to America. Afterward, Betsy Stone approached Sinha and identified herself as a member of the Socialist Workers Party who spent the previous year talking to voters. “We didn’t find racism or sexism or xenophobia,” she said. “We found people who say, ‘We need jobs like we used to have.’” Stone, 77, was a blast from the Bay Area’s radical, working-class past. She toiled as a janitor and told Sinha about once being dismissed by an airline company after it hired a contractor who could use immigrant labor for less money. “Great energy comes from all walks of life,” Sinha told her. “The whole world cannot come to the U.S.,” Stone countered. She and Sinha obviously disagreed about much, but then the conversation turned from their differences to their mutual disgust of Trump. Finally, Stone handed Sinha a copy of a socialist newspaper and went on her way. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

While there, I decided I wanted to get a pedicure. My search turned into quite the adventure — one that involved cutting edge translation technology, and a key word lost in translation. Google and Baidu (which is often referred to as China's Google) have built voice translation apps, available here and here. You speak into them, they listen and then they translate into the language you choose. They do it in writing, by displaying text on the screen as you talk; and out loud, by using your phone's speaker to narrate what you've said once you're done talking. These robot translators can radically change your experience in a foreign land — or at least that's what happened for me. Though it was not a promising start. A small miracle I was in the city of Zhengzhou. It was 10 p.m. and I had cabin fever. For days I'd felt stuck in the tourist vortex, and the Internet said that just four kilometers away, there was a late-night pedicure salon open. Apps like Google Translate could radically change your experience traveling abroad. Google Translate/Screenshot by NPR hide caption toggle caption Google Translate/Screenshot by NPR A hotel concierge put me in a cab. Using my Baidu Translate app, I asked him: "Will [the driver] put on the meter for the taxi?" I wanted to make sure I wouldn't get charged inflated prices for a quick ride. But he didn't quite understand. The translation was butchered. No matter. I took off anyway. The driver dropped me at a crowded corner, but I didn't see the salon. And I couldn't read the numbers on the buildings. It's all Chinese. So I walked into a store and went up to a woman inside. I shoved the address and my phone in her face. And a small miracle happened. She spoke slowly and clearly, and the app began to transcribe. I read the words on my screen: "Go forward 10 meters and turn right." This is mind-blowing. The directions are so specific, something you could never get with just body language. I thanked her (undoubtedly butchering the word for "thank you") and set off. I turned the corner, just as she instructed, and I saw a storefront with feet on the window. I had arrived. "Pedicure" Only it's not quite what I had in mind. Turns out the pedicure salon was actually a dingy hole-in-the-wall, kind of like a dive bar. Aging men were paying to get their enormous callouses pounded down and their toenails scraped with large, surgical-looking scalpels. All Tech Considered Machines, Lost In Translation: The Dream Of Universal Understanding I decided to stick around because, hey, it's an authentic local experience. Trouble is, my translation apps kept crashing. It could be because the Internet connection was weak. The apps need the Internet to work. I tried to ask the lady attending to me about the service options: What do I get for one hour exactly? She spoke into my phone over and over, and I got this broken non-sentence back — with a key word repeated. 'Give Money' 0:29 Toggle more options Embed Embed <iframe src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/520832901/520846591" width="100%" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="NPR embedded audio player"> This is unedited audio. Note the long pauses between each speaker and the translator. The delays could be because of a poor Internet connection, or because of background noise. Money! The lady wanted me to pay 88 yuan (a little less than $13). She put me in a torn faux leather recliner, right across from a drunk guy who was shouting non-stop and threw his complimentary green tea to the floor. This is my Chinese "pedicure." Experts weigh in "That actually raises a good issue, which is that there's a lot more to translation than mapping one word to another," says Macduff Hughes. "The cultural understanding is something that's hard to fully capture just in translation." Hughes is translation chief at Google, in charge of the main app I used in China. I went to his office in Mountain View, Calif., and it turns out, he's more critical of the app than I am. All Tech Considered Turn On, Tune In, Transcribe: U.N. Develops Radio-Listening Tool Hughes says Google has worked for nearly two decades to perfect search so that even if you (the user) don't quite know the words for what you want or can't spell them, Google helps you figure it out. Hughes wants the translation tool to do that: not just fixate on grammar, syntax and diction, but pay attention to intent and cultural differences. "You can imagine that if in addition to translating the word 'pedicure' from English to Chinese, we had shown you some pictures of Chinese pedicure salons, that might have been more helpful to you," he says. Google and Baidu use machine learning to power their translation technology. Here's how it works, in principle: you could have a human linguist dictate all the rules for going from one language to another. But that would be tedious, and yield poor results because a lot of languages aren't structured in parallel form. So instead, these companies have moved to pattern recognition through "neural machine translation." They take a mountain of data — really good translations — and load it into their computers. Algorithms then mine through the data to look for patterns. The end product is translation that's not just phrase-by-phrase, but entire thoughts and sentences at a time. Wu Hua and Zhao Shiqi, leaders with Baidu's translation team, say that according to their data, Chinese nationals traveling abroad — say to Europe or the U.S. — rely on their app to talk with locals. Baidu has also developed an off-line neural translation system, enabling the users to use the translation service when a 3G or better connection isn't available. Pedicure, round 2 Before harping too much on what went wrong for me, let's turn to Chapter 2 of my quest, which took place in Shanghai. Enlarge this image Shanghai pedicurist Ju-wen Zu and NPR's Aarti Shahani talk, aided by a translation app that may change the way we travel abroad forever. Aarti Shahani/NPR hide caption toggle caption Aarti Shahani/NPR Shanghai pedicurist Ju-wen Zu and NPR's Aarti Shahani talk, aided by a translation app that may change the way we travel abroad forever. Aarti Shahani/NPR I spotted a shop with nail polish in the window and the word "pedicure" in English on the door. It felt like a safe bet. I stepped in and used the Google Translate app to ask the pedicurist for her name. She told me it's Ju-wen Zu. Ju-wen was patient, curious and willing to talk with me using this strange new tool. It also helped that the app behaved, and the store was quiet. She put my feet in water that's the perfect temperature, and we chatted just like in salons back home. I learned that Ju-wen's parents are farmers. She's 36 years old and followed her big sister to Shanghai. She met her husband here and has a teenage boy. (A human translator listened to these exchanges and confirmed their accuracy.) I asked her if life in the big city is hard or easy. She answered, and the app said: "Shanghai outsiders difficult place to exist because the housing is very expensive. Rent is also high." I was surprised by how nuanced that answer was. Then Ju-wen and I had this seamless exchange: 'The Housing Is Very Expensive' 1:14 Toggle more options Embed Embed <iframe src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/520832901/520847057" width="100%" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="NPR embedded audio player"> Notice how seamless the conversation can be when the translation app works quickly — translating immediately after a speaker is done talking. I learned that her rent is 3,000 yuan per month and her pay is 8,000 yuan. As I got personal, she got personal too and asked a question women around the world seem to love asking each other: "Do you have a boyfriend?" This experience strikes me as profound. While political leaders, like President Trump, talk about erecting walls and closing borders, technology is marching in the opposite direction, knocking down the most fundamental wall that divides us: language. Technology is enabling this little foray into pedicure diplomacy. "You are awesome!" she told me. I told her she is too. We talked for about an hour this way. Google's Hughes says, "That is fantastic." According to the tech companies' data, my pedicurist and I set a world record of sorts. Google tracks how long conversations typically last, and the vast majority are just three to four exchanges. Baidu says conversations on its translation app average seven to eight exchanges.

The latest was a major December update aimed at improving the game. There’s plenty to love about the latest changes, but it’s also causing problems for some. Here we’ll explain how to fix the “Device is not compatible” error while trying to update Clash of Clans on Android. Additionally, we have more details about Google accounts not syncing correctly for saved villages. It’s one of the most popular titles on Android and iOS. Millions of people play it daily. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this error message, but recently it has been happening more frequently. Most other issues can be fixed with the instructions below. Read: Clash of Clans Updates: 7 Things We Want Next The last update added tons of level 11 troops, cheaper costs and other things. However, it also added some problems. In fact, some can’t update the game at all. As a result it can’t be played. This is a big issue, and hopefully the few suggestions below can help. If you haven’t updated you’ll see a notification upon launching the game that an update is available. You cannot play until you accept this, go to the Google Play Store, and update to the latest version of the game. Everything is fine for those on iOS, but Android users are being met with a very odd problem. Users are getting an error on the Google Play Store for Clash of Clans that says, “Device is not compatible with this version” and are unable to update. Supercell confirmed this is a problem, and has offered up a fix for those having issues. Players affected by "Your device is not compatible with this version", please try: Settings >App Manager>Google Play Store>Clear data/cache — Clash of Clans (@ClashofClans) January 26, 2016 If you can’t update, you can’t play. Some are even in an active Clan War and can’t update in order to fight before time runs out. Which as many can imagine, would be very frustrating. Update: On February 26th Supercell made some changes and had another small maintenance break to fix the device incompatible and other Google services issues. Let us know in the comments below if the problem is still going on. Update #2: On March 4th Supercell finally fixed the Google Play Store device not compatible Clash of Clans problem, as well as the Google Games ID and sync issue many users have been experiencing. According to them, those who were unable to sync their Google Games account to restore or save a village, and the thousands of users who couldn’t update, should all be able to download the latest update from the Google Play Store release late last night and this morning. Head into the Play Store, check for updates, and download it right now to get back to Clashing. Update #3: The new December Clash of Clans update made this issue appear again. Users have also experienced crashes while in global chat, chat logs being out of order and other small things. Supercell may release another optional update to fix this. Even people that have been using the same device for well over a year are having issues. We’re seeing reports all over Twitter that people with tablets, the LG G3, Galaxy S6 and other devices are all experiencing this error. I’ve updated a Galaxy S7, Nexus 6P, Pixel C tablet and Nexus 9 all without any problems. So we’re not sure what is causing this at the moment, or what Android devices are experiencing it. been playing #COC on the same phone for 3 months and today its telling me that my device is not compatible with this version @ClashofClans — EllisWard✌️ (@fan_paige_wwe) January 26, 2016 If you are trying to update Clash of Clans on an Android device but running into problems, there are a few potential fixes. There is either something messed up with the Google Play Store, or something Supercell did. They’re blaming it on the Google Play, and suggest users clear the Store cache or data to resolve it. Above are basic instructions, but below are screenshots to help those experiencing issues. Instructions To fix the Clash of Clans update “your device is not compatible with this version” error message, try clearing the Google Play Store cache, and then data. Next, restart the Google Play Store and accept the update again. Pull down the notification bar on your Android device and hit the gear-shaped settings icon, or find “settings” in the application tray. From here navigate to Apps, or App Manager. Next scroll down and find Google Play Store. Select this, and tap “Clear Cache or Data” as shown below. This should erase everything, and get rid of any corrupt files that seem to be causing this problem. Supercell claims this will fix the error. Multiple comments suggest it worked. Now go back and download the update. Other Options However, if this doesn’t solve the problem another option is to uninstall Clash of Clans and re-install it. Yes, that sounds scary, and no one wants to lose their entire village by uninstalling the game. You won’t. Obviously proceed at your own risk and use caution. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone If the game is backed up to Google+ or Google Games (an option in settings) your progress is saved. Meaning you can uninstall Clash, reinstall it, and restore your progress simply by going into settings and connecting to Google+, and it will restore your village in less than 10 seconds. However, if you never linked the two, this won’t work. So do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it’s backed up. The guide above goes over a few details regarding transferring the game to a new phone, which is also how you can save progress. That said, if you can’t open the game you can’t link it to Google Games. Do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it is saved. Conclusion This is a big problem. Supercell states that clearing the Google Play Store cache is your only option, and it should solve any issues. They’re currently looking into other options, and will offer up additional information if available. At the end of the day, did clearing the cache or data fix it for you? Let us know in the comments below. Those who fixed it using other methods, feel free to share it below. The December update was loaded with content and a Christmas theme. Expect a bug fixing update in 2017 along with removal of the winter theme. 240 Responses 01/26/2016 kim Reply No, it did not work for me.

Sims Reply Listen to the man or woman lol… Delete all data in “Google Play Store” & “Google Play Services” from your phones settings… this guaranteed to work (then go back to Google play store, accept terms. Then update the app)… from what I know it works with newer phones, if not you could be out of luck. 04/19/2016 ScottManJo Reply Finally got all my favorite Supercell games loaded onto my Galaxy Tab E Lite. Be sure to clear out the Cache & Date from the following 3 apps: Google Play Services, Google Play Store AND Google Play Games. I was able to get CoC & Boom Beach by clearing the first 2 but only could get Clash Royale after clearing Google Play Games. Hope this helps! Good luck & god speed! 05/02/2016 Jeremy Reply ^^ had to do all 3 for mine to work also! Thanks. 07/17/2016 Michael Reply OMG DUDE THANKS!! I got the same device and got super nervous when I couldnt get clash of clans!

Thanks! 02/06/2016 Laryssa Reply I have the g4 it didn’t work for me. Won’t even come up when I search it. Neither does boom beach so I am guessing it has something to do with supercell.

I have nothing to clear out. I don’t understand. 07/03/2016 wardojr Reply try updating play store service… 01/26/2016 sol goslin Reply No it diddnt work. I had hopes it would but no such luck. This sucks. I cant even get to the supercell customer service/help line. There may be other issues with this though. Im also noticing a significant drop in the speed of my device, so it may be something that either supercell got in its system, or someone hacked google and delivered a little viral surprise. If thats the case Im sure it will make itself known in a bigger than life fashion. Hopefully that isnt the case. Keep posting updates on what happens. A LOT of people are locked out of the game through this. 07/22/2016 Clara Icasiano Reply just uninstall in play games then install it again.

This isn’t the first time and they always say the same fixes and is not working. He brought a new phone and 3_4 months , the same problem. And with their lack of customer service good luck on their emails telling you to contact them in the game. If not fixed soon I will retire my three accounts and so will my friend with four, and its sad seeing that we both spent over $150 on accounts each. 01/28/2016 Nathalie Blues Reply I have spent over $1300 and lead a clan where my friends have spent the same. This is not acceptable SuperCell. Get with the freaking program and fix this. Fix it now ! 01/26/2016 dan Reply Did not work for me either. Th 9 and 3 years of playing gone. They need to sort this shit out. That’s bullshit. 01/26/2016 Scott Reply Didn’t work on my galaxy s5 active. Thus is very frustrating being I’m in a active war and can’t attack.

What worked was clearing cache per the suggestion, but when doing the update go to my apps and bulk update all apps that need an update. If I went directly to COC under my apps I still got a message stating it wasn’t compatible. 01/26/2016 Dave Reply I deleted the game and now its completely gone from the google play store, same for boom beach 01/26/2016 Bethany Reply Nope didnt work 01/26/2016 Ryan Reply After just clearing the cache my problem was fixed . hope that helps everyone else 01/26/2016 LEI Reply Me too..tried to uninstall coc but unforunately when i try to download it again, cannot find coc in play store… Help pls… 01/26/2016 Anthony Williams Reply Didn’t work for my kindle fire. 01/26/2016 Bob the clasher Reply Figured it out!! MUST SIGN CLASH OF CLANS INTO GOOGLE PLAY! go to settings→apps→clash of clans and then clear data (i know scarry). Then go to play store and my apps.

Re-tried clearing the GP cache and data, still not available. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply For those not seeing in Google Play store after installing, You have to go to Google Play Games app in order to install after uninstalling. Your device is listed as not compatible so it will not show up. Also, if you find a copy of the new update By searching coc apk file on Google, it will install by side loading also. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply Here is a link to the latest download for sideloading. http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/supercell/clash-of-clans/clash-clans-8-116-2-android-apk-download/ 01/27/2016 Shawn Reply S5 being playing for a year now suddenly cant play, this is unacceptable, why was the upgrade not tested, when will you resolve it?! 01/27/2016 Umang Reply For everyone who’s facing this problem..go to Google play store through your browser, log in and install the game.

Read comment here and have tried clear cache, data and uninstall update for play store, play game, and play service. Still no luck. Not even show up in play store. 3. Post my comment here and back try again. It just suddenly show up. Install it and play.. No lag no issue. Around 1 hours of time for me to make that god damn stupid install button appear in my play store for doc game! Stupid conclusion from me after tried to install it. Someone say clear 3 time and bulk update. So, MAYBE after we have clear that, it will automatic download the update for playstore and it need sometime for that and without any notification on it. Give it some time after clear cache and data than try again. Hope that’s help. 01/27/2016 Sean Reply Motorola moto 3. Cleared cacache. Nope. Cleared data. Nope.

Then you get the message of incompatibility. I cleared Play Store cache and data once. Not solved. Did it once more and restarted the phone. Not solved. Instead chose option ‘update all’ on notification drop-down menu. It updated CoC! Opened CoC page in Play Store. Did still after update say device not compatible and no option to open the game.

I decided to uninstall the game and check the store, where it still said my device (LG phone) wasn’t compatible. Vexing to say the least.

My son however, just got a new Alcatel One Touch when he opened it, we updated all apps. Google Play shows the app as attached to his previous apps, but will not let us load it on his phone. We tried the “Clear Cache” fix even thought the phone was 2 hours old. This did not fix it. He is the entire reason I play the game. If his can’t be fixed, I will delete mine soon as well. Please give him a solution as to how we can load Clash Of Clans on his new Alcatel. 10/09/2016 CaPtAiN_DrOgO Reply try downloading the apk file from any website(latest ver) and then update google play services and google play games from play store…….worked for me…gd lk 04/06/2016 jarie Reply i have a problem in my ohone rio craze junior its open my village and a few minutes clash of clans is error and back to main menu 04/07/2016 jarie Reply please help me to fix this problem 04/11/2016 kim diamse Reply I did everything you said in this post, cleared my data and cache and forced stopped the app. But I still can’t install clash of clans or clash royale.

LGBT? Oh, no, that's sensitive More like this Isp Google Fiber Personal Tech Google Fiber goes full Wizard of Oz: We're not in Kansas any more City wakes up to emails cancelling long-awaited 1Gbps broadband 20 Mar 2017 at 20:45, Kieren McCarthy Analysis Looking back, it should have been obvious: when Google announced in 2011 that it would roll out its own super-fast internet service for just $70 a month, offering 1Gbps over its own fiber, it started out in Kansas. Another extravaganza that started in Kansas, in the very center of the United States, was the Wizard of Oz – the classic tale of a naïve child taken ill, who underwent a series of delusions in which she believed she was fighting against evil but knew she would win thanks to having a good heart. But just as Dorothy had her dreams shattered when it turned out the Wizard of Oz did not possess magic powers and could not make her dreams come true, so Google has come to realize that it simply can't afford to keep running Google Fiber at a loss out of some naïve fantasy of how internet access should work. This week, hundreds, possibly thousands, of hopeful Google Fiber customers awoke from their reverie to find an email from the ad-serving giant in which they were told, finally, that their multi-year wait for fast, cheap internet access was over: they wouldn't be getting it after all. "Thanks for signing up for Google Fiber," it began. "Although we've been working hard to bring you service, we're unable to build our network to connect your home or business at this time. "Unfortunately, that means we'll need to cancel your Fiber account. If you paid a deposit, we'll refund your deposit amount to your original form of payment in the next two weeks." Yellow brick no Unsurprisingly, Kansas City dwellers are not too impressed with this turn of events. Former IT worker Larry Meurer told Kansas City telly station KSHB that he'd signed up over 18 months ago but despite having seen numerous Google Fiber trucks in the neighborhood, he never got an email – until the cancellation came through. "I'm left wondering what is going on," he said. He's not the only one: Google refuses to divulge what's happening, saying only that it "loves Kansas City and is here to stay." While it also claims to be expanding in some parts of the city (the up-and-coming Raymore area and the densely populated Overland Park), the Google Fiber website notes that people only have until March 23 – later this week – to sign up for service in the limited areas where it is expanding. Estimates are that several thousand people have received the cancellation notices, representing a further retreat away from Google's grand mission. Google is slowly killing its plan to take on Big Cable. When Fiber CEO Craig Barratt stepped down back in October, Google didn't replace him. Last month it finally announced Greg McCray was taking over – and the first thing he did was slash staff. Since then, Google has been pushing people to its wireless Webpass service (if you check out eligibility for Fiber, chances are you'll be redirected to Webpass). In short, Google is killing off its plans for rolling out fiber and for some reason has decided to be infuriatingly chummy about it rather than just admit to the situation. "Google Fiber remains committed to our customers and cities. We want to bring Google Fiber to customers faster, so we're focused on making deployment more efficient and less intrusive," we were told. The web ad giant said the same to KSHB – it is "committed to Kansas City" – although wouldn't comment further. Click your heels It was only a year ago that Google was so sure of its Kansas City bet that it announced it was going to offer free internet access to nine public housing facilities in the area. Over 80 per cent of the city has said it was interested in getting the service. But as we noted at the time, that approach was flying in the face of financial realities: Google Fiber is a big part of the "Other Bets" division of the company and it has lost $3.5 billion in the previous 12 months. Just two months later, the inevitable: it was killing off its free internet program. But, Google noted – as it notes every time it withdraws Google Fiber projects – it will continue supplying those it has already connected. As to who and how many those people are however, well, Google won't tell anyone that. But it wasn't all a complete failure. In fact, Google Fiber's most useful legacy may be that it shone a spotlight on the lack of real competition in the ISP market and flagged up the fact that Big Cable can do much more than it is currently doing if it's in its interests. Big Cable repeatedly sued Google as a way of slowing down its rollout of fiber in Kansas City. When that failed, in 2015, AT&T suddenly announced that it would also offer a new 1Gbps service for the same $70 a month price (plus $29 a month if you don't want it to sell your personal details). Even more amazingly, two months after that, Comcast decided it would be able to offer no less than 2Gbps service. Both companies have been equally responsive to Google Fiber's problems. AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues, Joan Marsh, wrote a blog post mocking Google Fiber as an "experiment," writing: "Google Fiber will no doubt continue its broadband experiments, while coming up with excuses for its shortcomings and learning curves ... It will also no doubt continue to seek favoritism from government at every level." And just today, Comcast showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that less competition does not mean it will slow down: it is more than doubling the speed of its Performance service for no cost in Kansas City. That's right: from 25Mbps to 55Mbps for just $60 a month.

Bradford Monday, March 20, 2017 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print SMS More Reddit Google Stumbleupon Download Download PDF File Download the policy brief Summary In this policy brief, we highlight the impact of the speed and the scale that digital innovation will have in disrupting labor markets in the future, which requires anticipating policy responses now. We advocate for the formation of new social partnerships between business, labor, governments, financial institutions, and social stakeholders to forge comprehensive policy responses to address the coming social impact of technological change. This brief was used at the VISION 20 Workshop held at the Brookings Institution on February 27, 2017 to help generate new “big picture” policy approaches for the German G-20 Summit in Hamburg in July. The workshop was sponsored by the University of British Columbia Institute for Asia Research, the Munk School at the University of Toronto, the Boell Foundation, and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung with the participation of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and the German Development Institute. Editor's Note: This paper is part of a two part series focused on investment in skills development and new public-private partnerships as potential policy responses to the perceived failure of the market economy and globalization to deliver politically sustainable social outcomes. BACKGROUND The G-20 needs more agile governance structures to create policies that avoid a “luddite backlash” against the accelerating level of labor market dislocation caused by widespread automation due to “digitalization.” The productivity benefits of digitalization will drive valuable GDP growth and will be necessary to offset the declining growth in the global labor force.[1]  However, without action, certain groups will be “left behind” and inequality of income and opportunity is likely to rise, further fueling the current wave of populist political movements. The accelerated pace of technological change will require a matching pace of policy development and execution and a level of public-private sector coordination that has not been seen outside wartime. Participating private companies will gain from both regulatory and legal certainty, and social stability. Authors Roger Burkhardt Technology Advisor - Former CTO, NYSE Colin I. Bradford Nonresident Senior Fellow - Global Economy and Development The rise of populist movements successfully challenging the post-war consensus around globalization and free trade has been driven by a narrative of communities permanently left behind by economic and social dislocations from the increasingly free movement of labor and goods.  This can be seen in the regions that voted for Brexit in the United Kingdom, from the rise of populist European parties, and in “rust belt” states in the United States that switched parties to give Donald Trump the presidency. These movements exploit “fear of the other” by railing against immigration and outsourcing but have not, so far, targeted the hollowing out of middle-class jobs by technology dislocation. For example in the U.S. rust belt, well-paid skilled manufacturing jobs have been lost to automation and the new jobs generated since 2007 are often lower paid services jobs in metropolitan areas benefiting different racial groups.  Since late 2007 there has been a gain of 9 million jobs overall in the U.S., but for white workers age 25-54 years old there was a net loss of 6.5 million jobs, while minorities gained 5.5 million jobs.[2] Conclusion Current political systems are struggling to address the rise of populist movements in reaction to the dislocations from globalization. There will be a greatly accelerated pace of dislocation from the current wave of software driven automation, demanding a more rapid and effective response. Public-private partnerships including business and labor organizations at national and international (e.g., European Union) levels are the central recommendation. These partnerships should be supported by strong information sharing among the G-20 to address the global nature of the technology changes and the global nature of the leading private players such as Google, Facebook, Uber, Amazon, Baidu, and Tencent. The current pace of legal and regulatory responsiveness is quite inadequate to match the accelerating pace of technological change and dislocation. This mismatch constrains both the productivity benefits of digitalization and the ability to define, model, and test regulatory and economic policy changes to mitigate the attendant dislocations. These public-private partnerships need to provide opportunities to experiment with regulatory and economic frameworks in realistic pilots that test policy at the requisite pace.  The U.S. has a long history of this kind of experimentation at the state level. Discussion Digitalization – Exponential pace of change: The impact of dislocation due to digitalization is now broadening to white collar and professional jobs and is accelerating rapidly because of the exponential economics of Moore’s law,[3] which observes that the number of transistors on mass-produced chips doubles every two years. Since manufacturing cost per chip changes little, this represents an exponential improvement in the cost of computer processing and enables artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as “deep learning” by large neural networks.   The latest leap forward comes from chips optimized for this AI software now being rolled out by digital leaders such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon. These “deep learning” techniques need large volumes of training data to be functional and this vital input is also growing exponentially—the total volume of data doubles every 3 years.[4]  We have seen the impact of these new software capabilities in image and speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and language translation, among many other fields. Related Content Up Front Merkel and Trump find common ground on workforce training Colin I. Bradford Friday, March 17, 2017 Fixed industrial robots are pervasive, but now with new AI technologies enabling environmental awareness, robots are becoming mobile and taking on tasks like wind turbine maintenance.  Costs are falling such that large Chinese manufacturing firms like FoxConn are investing in robots,[5] and robots such as Baxter are being designed to work alongside and be directed by humans without explicit programming.[6] These advanced robots apply logic to handle less structured work and are predicted in a Boston Consulting Group analysis of global manufacturing to automate 25 percent of all tasks by 2025.[7] Other examples of the impact of machine learning include diagnosis programs that are more accurate than human radiologists and “robotic process automation” software in financial services that eliminates 90 percent of the large staffs currently processing certain compliance and mortgage documents. Analyses of global labor market impact: The scale of impact can be seen in Frey and Osborne’s systematic occupational analysis of the potential impact across the U.S. economy, which estimates that 47 percent of jobs are at risk[8] in the next 10-20 years. Frey cites a 2013 McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) study looking at the potential impact on knowledge workers and estimates that 140 million workers would be affected worldwide. Most recently MGI’s deeper task-based global analysis estimates that 49 percent of jobs are at risk from automation (ibid, n.1).  Clearly, in many cases jobs will be partially rather than fully automated, but the impact on the volume and nature of employment will still be profound. The pace of impact is harder to predict but will accelerate as software plays a greater role. The rollout of automation in manufacturing over the last 20 years has been constrained by the high capital costs of industrial robots. As AI software becomes the critical value element driving performance, however, we will see a dramatic acceleration in adoption. Put simply, the marginal cost of replacing a worker with a robot system in manufacturing is approximately $130,000 today (ibid, n.7), but the marginal cost of applying AI software to white collar work can be as little as the cost to download software into existing infrastructure. So, for example, in both the radiology and financial services examples, documents are already digitally scanned so the marginal cost of replacing a worker with AI powered software is small compared with the 90 percent productivity gains. As these accelerating effects become evident in the broad economy there is a very real risk that populist movements gain additional strength, and, in addition to potentially reversing the benefits of trade, they will challenge the introduction of productivity improving technology that has been an important engine of wealth creation in the modern age. Proposed governance approach: An agile public-private sector partnership The pace of governmental response today is too slow to keep up with the exponential pace of modern information technology driven change. As a result major societal changes occur without a public dialogue or meaningful government involvement—at least not until after the “facts on the ground” are already established. For example, consider the global adoptions of Uber and AirBnB, which in many cases ignored local regulations. The structure of government response is typically driven by individual departmental agendas and fragmented between different levels of government without an overarching strategy, or consideration of the interplay between actions taken by different departments and different levels of government. In the existing patchwork, the private sector often lacks the legal and regulatory predictability to make large investments. Major structural changes are often driven by a few global technology companies, raising concerns about future employment at national companies that currently play a vital role in the industrial base. These challenges can best be addressed by a set of fast moving public-private multi-disciplinary teams, incorporating government, business, and labor. The teams will adopt best practices from industry and use an iterative collaborative approach to create comprehensive and consistent policy and regulatory frameworks, model their economic and social effects and test them in pilots. These teams can learn from the agile software methodology that has swept the information technology industry over the last 15 year.[9] This agile methodology integrates all stakeholders up front and has driven better quality deliverables aligned with real end user needs. The various public participants must work to conceive a holistic and comprehensive framework to meet agreed social and economic goals. The scope should include job redesign, job retraining, as well as the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks. The private participants will include leading global and national industry participants, likely organized through business and labor organizations. An iterative consultative approach will identify and mitigate negative dislocations. A critical characteristic of this agile approach is a rapid and iterative cycle of policy development, perhaps a biweekly cycle delivering an integrated set of recommendations that have been modeled and are ready for a pilot implementation in a six-month period. Implementing this new approach will be challenging and should be limited initially to a small number of critical domains. These domains can be prioritized by leveraging research that identifies those occupations and tasks that are most subject to technological disruption (see research cited above). These critical domains clearly include substantial areas of white-collar work. (See Appendix A for a worked example in the autonomous vehicle field.) Specific policy tools will naturally be developed at the national level, but as the technology and the dominant private participants are global, it makes sense for the G-20 to create rapid information sharing mechanisms by industry segment. These policy tools will best come from public-private groups focused on specific industry changes at the national level and with the ability to rapidly approve policy frameworks for pilots. (See Appendix B for a set of policy tools that are likely to be broadly relevant.) Appendix A: Worked example of the impact of autonomous vehicles There has been wide coverage of how ride-sharing services such as Uber have expanded rapidly as their technology platforms enable millions of “amateur” drivers to replace licensed taxi drivers creating new “gig economy” jobs and downward pressure on wages and benefits of professional drivers. Barriers to entry such as the cost of a taxi medallion and the “knowledge” that a London taxi driver must acquire are replaced with the download of an Uber app, which in turn relies on the GPS, and map-enabled smart phones. Given these pervasive platforms, the marginal cost of the technology to replace one taxi driver is tiny: just one download. More fundamentally, we see evidence that autonomous vehicles may be able to eliminate professional drivers and truckers altogether. Dismissed as impossible as recently as 2004,[10] advances in machine learning and sensors have enabled Google, Uber, and others to test autonomous vehicles on public roads safely covering over a million miles, and Uber and Otto are now piloting commercial use for taxi and delivery services respectively in Pittsburgh and Ohio. This dramatic acceleration in innovation is because of semiconductor advances captured by Moore’s law and the near zero cost of distributing capabilities through software. As Moore’s law has driven down the cost of computing, deep learning software can accurately perceive the environment around it through RADAR and LIDAR sensors, which have collapsed in price from tens of thousands of dollars per car to a few hundred dollars as they shrunk to single chip implementations.[11] The impact on society is broad and substantial including: Safety of transportation by road.  (Proponents predict greatly reduced accidents.) Radical reductions of the jobs of millions of currently employed professional drivers. Reduced benefits for drivers who become part of the “gig economy” working for firms like Uber. Issues of liability by the various providers including vehicle manufacturers and service providers such as mapping services and ride sharing services. Impact on income inequality as large global technology companies capture most of the benefits of productivity gains and reduced wage costs. A public-private partnership team for autonomous trucking would include vehicle manufacturers, trucking businesses, labor unions, state, and federal licensing authorities and regulatory agencies covering safety, insurance, labor, and driver licensing. Specific policies to be modeled and then trialed include: To require a driver/loader for each truck but allow certain distance highway driving on complete “auto-pilot” thus capturing some but not all of the productivity benefits. Relaxing the current constraints on driver hours to recognize that they can sleep for approved highway sections while the truck proceeds autonomously. A set of legal, liability and regulatory changes that support this. An investment in retraining displaced drivers including a living wage for a transition period of up to 12 months Appendix B: Representative set of policy tools for consideration A faster cycle time for economic research and labor market data:  Government surveys every 5 years are inadequate; a much faster pulse in affected industries will be required with input from employers and unions.  Investment is required for research into: Which jobs are being automated and under which economic circumstances? Which jobs can be elevated in skill (and wages) through software assistants? The consequent changes in employment patterns. The skills required for new jobs and re-training approaches that work. Economic and other factors that block workers from retraining. Educate government and industry decision makers on the new AI automation capabilities and their potential impact on employment and the opportunity for jobs to be upgraded to more valuable and challenging work. Examples of opportunities to upgrade jobs include: Financial services compliance such as onboarding new customers where AI can currently automate 80-90 percent of the document reviews and flag 10 percent of possible exceptions for human review and resolution. The remaining 10 percent require deeper knowledge, broader experience, and greater cross-functional collaboration and so may well be candidates for on shoring. In IT operations, more than 90 percent of trouble tickets can be resolved by AI software with the remaining tickets being resolved by systems administrators operating at higher levels of expertise. In customer service situations, robotic software can assist the worker in resolving a customer’s issue and in parallel suggest a cross-selling opportunity, thus increasing both customer satisfaction and revenue. Incentivize worker training for displaced workers: This critical element is the subject of a separate proposal to accelerate social mobility by incentivizing greater private investment in the skill development of 21st century workers (“Training Tax Credit Proposal”). Wage “top up” support during the transition period to a new role to enable mid-career workers to continue to meet their financial obligations to their families through a training period that could take a year. The objective is to avoid cash flow issues driving workers to lower wage jobs by providing “top up” wages during a transition period of a year or less where they undergo employer-sponsored training supported through the tax credits in the Training Tax Credit Proposal. This temporary assistance can build on the concepts of the guaranteed minimum income that has included adherents such as Milton Friedman[12] and programs such the Progressive Wage in Singapore,[13] which specifically targets higher wages via skills upgrading. Other foundational systems in the G-20 include: the French Revenue de Solidarité Active (RSA),[14] the German Socialhilfe, and the U.K. Tax Credit System. In a few countries there is considerable debate on the national adoption of a living wage but referenda have failed and broad acceptance is not likely in the near term. Targeted use of “wage top up” programs to address dislocation should not wait. Working Hours: Speculation on how automation will drive down working hours and increase time for leisure and unpaid voluntary work goes back at least to Keynes but attempts to address unemployment through caps on weekly working hours have at best a mixed record.[15]  There is however a long run trend among OECD economies for a slow reduction in hours. Despite this history it is worth examining topics such as: How current overtime, tax, benefits, and regulatory structures drive employers to employ fewer people with longer hours. There is a public policy benefit to changing these structures to share available work. The impact of weakening overtime regulations in the U.S. as more workers fall into exempt categories (administrative, professional, etc.) and the dramatic reduction through inflation of the salary cap to $24,000. There is a pending attempt to reset this to $48,000. Catalog critical regulatory elements and policy trials and share them across the G-20. Regulations will need to be modified and clarified to support the benefits of automation. There should be sharing of scenario modeling, pilot results, best practices, and minimum standards in areas such as privacy, workplace regulation, public safety, tax, and accounting to help governments reduce potential: Regulatory arbitrage by global companies. Unintended negative social (and business) consequences. Dampening effects of regulatory uncertainty on private companies. Invest in lifetime learning programs that can be accessed by workers throughout their careers and minimize skills shortages to companies due to a mismatch of worker supply and demand (see the Training Tax Credit Proposal). A public-private collaboration to define and plan skills for different sectors is required. The Economist January 2017 special report on lifetime learning mentions some examples: Singapore’s Skills Future initiative includes industry skills planning over a 3-5 year horizon, with a system of small vouchers for all citizens and 90 percent funding for training for people over 40 years of age. Denmark’s Flexisecurity system, a public-private tripartite system for skills planning with paid leave for training as part of collective bargaining agreements. Technology can help with online training through massive online open courses. MOOC systems like Coursera and Udacity offer the prospect of lower costs for students (though they are currently largely accessed by college-educated students[16] and often only for computer science). Generation is a rare example of educational innovation aimed at entry-level jobs and claims 90 percent employment rates for more than 10,000 graduates.[17] It is currently supported by charity but aims to migrate to funding from employers. Corporate investments in training are declining in the U.S. and U.K. but AT&T is an example of a company that is retraining its workers for the digital age with both generous support via tuition fees and an expectation that employees take responsibility for their own training that is assessed in the performance appraisal system. United Technologies also provides up to $12,000 a year in tuition refunds with no strings attached.

Lakysha is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina's rural Berkeley County benefiting from a grant from Google, which on Monday unveiled one of its WiFi-equipped school buses in the area. (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard) Posted: Monday, March 20, 2017 10:04 am | Updated: 12:52 pm, Mon Mar 20, 2017. Wi-Fi on wheels: Google helps students get online, on the go Associated Press | 0 comments ST. STEPHEN, S.C. (AP) — Eighth-grader Lakaysha Governor spends two hours on the bus getting back and forth to school each day. Thanks to a grant from Google, she can now use that time more productively and get her homework done. The aspiring forensic anthropologist is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina's rural Berkeley County who will ride to school on one of 28, Google-funded, Wi-Fi-equipped school buses unveiled Monday. The tech giant also has given the school district 1,700 Chromebooks, the stripped-down laptops on which many schoolchildren now do their class and homework. As more class assignments and homework migrate online, such long bus rides have generally counted as lost time in preparing for the next school day. But Google said it hopes to help expand the use of Wi-Fi on school buses in other rural areas elsewhere around the country. Google has at least a decade-long relationship with Berkeley County, where it's invested more than $1 billion in data center complexes since 2007, bringing more than 100 jobs. Google says it also has awarded nearly $2 billion in grants to local schools and nonprofits. Google hopes to see the Wi-Fi program extended into other rural areas of the U.S., including locations where it already has data centers that process search queries and other information, according to Lilyn Hester, a Google spokeswoman based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The first such effort was launched last year in Caldwell County, North Carolina, where a data center already exists. The expansions are also needs-based, Hester said, and Google is focusing on rural places where broadband internet access has been slow to spread. "Why don't we make that instructional time?" Hester said of officials who have mused about the time many students spend on school buses. Google is also looking for ways to make the high-tech buses useful outside of school hours, working with the school district and community on places the buses can go once the school day is done to bring connectivity elsewhere, such as a community center or fellowship hall. Lakaysha, the eight-grader who has her eye on Harvard, has internet access at home like most of her friends. But thanks to the WiFi buses, she can get ahead on her work. Teachers are happy, she said, because "more students are doing their homework." And she said even rambunctious preschoolers aboard the bus are quieter in the mornings while older students are doing homework. "Now that we have the Chromebooks and the WiFi, they're kind of quiet; so it's good for everybody." ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

The assistant will have its own dedicated button on the left side of the phone, just below the volume controls, and aims to differentiate itself from Apple's Siri and Google Now by offering a “deeper experience” than its rivals, thanks to its “completeness, context awareness and cognitive tolerance”. According to InJong Rhee, executive vice president and Head of R&D Software and Services at Samsung, Bixby will essentially be able to control almost every task that the application is capable of performing using the conventional interface, rather than supporting only a few selected tasks. This ‘completeness’ will make the assistant less confusing as to what actions users can perform or not. Much like Google Assistant, Bixby will also be context aware, which means that users will be able to call on the assistant at any time and have it understand the current context and state of an app. But it reportedly goes a step beyond by letting users combine voice and touch interactions, whichever they feel is most comfortable and intuitive, without losing progress of the task at hand. Lastly, in the area of 'cognitive tolerance’, Samsung says its digital assistant will be able to understand commands with incomplete information, executing the command in piecemeal by taking care of what it did understand and prompting users to provide more information as needed. Samsung is framing Bixby as more about controlling complex tasks within apps using your voice, rather than being an extension of search that can offer quick facts and silly jokes. Right of the bat it will only work with 10 Samsung apps, however, which will significantly limit its usefulness. It will also be limited to just English and Korean at first, with Chinese and US Spanish to be added shortly after launch. The vision for Bixby doesn’t end with smartphones. Samsung says eventually the assistant will be embedded within all its appliances, so you can control your air conditioner or TV through Bixby.

If you were to read the latest comparisons, you might get the impression Siri is a bit behind the other guys, mainly because Amazon Echo is doing well as the first real standalone speaker product for a personal assistant, and Google Home is following closely behind with its new ‘Assistant’. But with what’s rumored to be in store for iPhone 8 from good sources, I think Siri and Apple’s standalone Siri speaker product will have some big advantages. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Multi-language support An always-on, Wi-Fi connected Siri speaker in your home could be the next major step we see for Apple’s assistant this year. The latest reports claim the secretive Siri speaker product is far along enough to be in prototype testing after a couple of years of development and will likely debut this year. It sounds similar to connected speaker products already on the market, but Apple’s big advantage is Siri. And Siri’s first big advantage versus Amazon Echo and Google Home: Multi-language support. It already supports a long list of languages and region-specific accents and data, something Amazon and Google are way behind on. How behind? Alexa speaks English and German with varying support for features, Google Home/Assistant speaks only English. Siri, on the other hand, speaks over 20 languages with localized accents for many and support for all the big markets including English, French, Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese and many more. HomeKit It also already has a quickly growing ecosystem of home automation products through the HomeKit platform— homebuilders in the US and UK are now preinstalling HomeKit accessories— and controlling those kind of products will undeniably be a big part of these always-on personal assistant speaker products. Apple has expanded with support for new types of accessories and features each year at WWDC, and I’d expect this year will be the same. It’s already a step ahead of the competition with HomeKit, and that will make for a ton of possibilities at launch for a Siri speaker. Apple is also said to be working on facial recognition features for the Siri speaker, according to recent reports from Bloomberg and others, which means it could have a camera and that would allow for many features the current assistant speakers don’t have. If a camera and facial recognition do indeed show up in a Siri speaker, that could also mean built-in HomeKit security camera features and other HomeKit functionality, for example, intelligent multi-user support. The ability to recognize who is in a room and or talking seem like natural possibilities, but a tie-in to Apple’s work with augmented reality is another… AR/Camera features – Facial recognition – Apple TV A camera and facial recognition sound like huge differentiators for the in-development Siri speaker versus the competition. It could mean Apple’s Siri speaker could be truly context aware, versus just voice-activated. A number of reports claim Apple is working on 3D sensing and augmented reality tech for the next-generation of iPhones. Most of those reports seem to indicate Apple will first debut the tech by way of some sort of facial recognition camera applications for the iPhone 8. It wouldn’t be much of a stretch to imagine that Apple’s facial recognition tech for iPhone 8 might be similar or even tie-in to Siri speaker functionality in some way. And with a camera attached to an always on Siri speaker with facial recognition in your living room, perhaps also connected to an Apple TV, a whole new category of app possibilities will emerge. Apple TV apps could tap into the Siri speaker’s camera, for example, giving Apple TV apps a camera for things like video chat, security, gaming and AR applications. A recent concept (pictured above and below) imagined how Apple could use Siri for its augmented reality camera experience with the new iPhones. But it’s not just a concept. With all the recent reports, it’s looking like AR is going to be a big part of the next iPhones, so we know it’s likely on Apple’s radar for a Siri speaker too. Apps/SiriKit Last year’s Siri updates were notable. Siri debuted on the Mac for the first time, and it finally gained the ability to integrate with third-party apps with a Siri SDK. So far the app support is limited to a handful of categories like messaging, payments, VoIP calling, and ride booking. However, expanded SDK support to include functionality for any kind of app could supercharge Siri with new abilities quickly and often as developers inevitably look for innovative ways to approach integration. At the very least, a few more app categories for the SDK could get added at WWDC. Especially for third-party music, video and podcast apps could make Siri much more powerful. Either way, SiriKit has already prepared developers well ahead of time, which means lots of apps will already support Siri features by the time a Siri speaker rolls around likely later in the year. Apple’s Siri Speaker advantage  If you start to imagine a Siri speaker with these features–a camera for facial recognition, 3D sensing and augmented reality, an already robust and quickly growing home automation accessory ecosystem with HomeKit, multi-language support, and Apple TV apps–it’s easy to see Apple’s advantage. With the right timing alongside iPhone 8, these features could make Siri speaker look more like an innovative new product from Apple versus just its answer to the current crop of Amazon Echo and Google Home products.

Today the second beta build for that version has started rolling out over-the-air to devices that are enrolled in the Android Beta Program. If you have a device running the first beta build, you too should get the update notification soon. The list of supported devices hasn't changed with this release, so giving Android 7.1.2 a try before anyone else is still only possible if you have a Google Pixel, Pixel XL, or Pixel C, Huawei Nexus 6P, LG Nexus 5X, or Asus Nexus Player. For all of those products the build number for the new software is NPG47I. With Android Nougat Google has moved into a quarterly release cycle for new incremental versions, though it is unlikely that the final 7.1.2 build will actually roll out before March (and thus Q1) is over. We assume this might become public alongside next month's security patches on April 3. Obviously that's only true for the devices Google still supports. If you have a handset that isn't a Nexus or Pixel, many months will pass before you see any trace of Android 7.1.2 on it. That however might not be such a huge loss, since this iteration of the OS is basically all about bug fixes and small enhancements here and there. It has no big new features or anything like that.

Despite loudly touted efforts, the tech industry is making very little progress in diversifying its workforce, especially in technical and leadership positions. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that haven‚Äôt changed since. (File/Virginia Mayo/The Associated Press) Related Stories Tegan and Sara, Tyler Oakley blast YouTube 'restricted mode' blocking of LGBT content Google calling on students to design a doodle for Canada's 150th birthday Here's how the FBI says Russian hackers stole Yahoo account secrets Google apologized on Monday for allowing ads to appear alongside offensive videos on YouTube as more high-profile firms such as Marks & Spencer and HSBC pulled advertising for British markets from Google sites. The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic and anti-Semitic messages, prompting a flood of major companies to follow suit.​ YouTube faces social media storm over LGBT-blocking 'restricted mode' Britain is the largest market for Alphabet Inc.'s Google outside the United States, generating $7.8 billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly nine percent of the U.S. giant's global revenue. "I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Google EMEA President Matt Brittin said at the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London. Besides well-known British brands pulling the plug, some of the world's biggest advertising companies responsible for placing vast amounts of marketing material for clients, said they were reviewing how they worked with Google. The boycott is the latest clash between advertising companies and the internet giants that have built up dominant positions in digital advertising by offering not only huge audiences but also the ability to apply their user data to make ads more targeted and relevant. For big advertising groups such as WPP, internet firms are both a client and a competitor, while traditional media groups such as newspapers and general online news publishers are having to compete with them for online dollars. Hostile Industry "Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe…and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings," said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group. 'We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company.' - Martin Sorrell, WPP "Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem," he said. WPP, the world's largest advertising firm, said on Monday it was talking to clients and media partners such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished. "We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements," said Martin Sorrell, the founder and head of the British firm. Here's how the FBI says Russian hackers stole Yahoo account secrets Google offers a glimpse into its fight against fake news Publicis, the world's third largest advertising firm, said in a statement on Monday that it was clear Google had fallen short of meeting advertising standards and that the French company was reviewing its relationship with Google. Google said on Friday it worked hard to remove ads appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute it did not always get it right. Brittin said Google had made a commitment to doing better and would simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investment to enforce its ad policies faster. A spokeswoman for Google UK said it would look again at the way it defines incendiary commentary and hate speech to raise the bar on videos and sites allowed for advertising. On Friday, Google executives were called in to face questions from the advertising industry and Britain over the issue. Representatives for retailers Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's and Argos, British banks HSBC and RBS, McDonald's, the UK branch of advertising group Havas and the BBC told Reuters their firms had stopped ads. A source at Lloyds Banking said the lender had pulled the plug as well. Others such as Vodafone, Barclays and Tesco were reviewing policies, their representatives said.     © Thomson Reuters, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines U.K. attacker was British-born, had been investigated for 'violent extremism' video 'She was my only girl': Nunavut teen's death sheds light on failures in fighting TB After a nightmare attack, the resilience of Londoners resurfaces video Liberal budget avoids taxing rich, and misses a chance to make Canadians happier: Don Pittis Ivanka in the West Wing: Ethics concerns collide with hope for a 'moderating' voice Latest Technology & Science News Headlines New categories of dinosaur family tree proposed by scientists New wintertime low for Arctic sea ice: scientists Ground-breaking bat cave discovery gives Alberta researchers baseline in fight against deadly disease audio Lip-reading program more accurate than humans could help hearing-impaired Waste not on World Water Day: Bob McDonald Quirks & Quarks Digging up Pharaohs, Biofuels in the Sky, Lawrence Krauss on Why We're Here One Minute of Exercise, Fukushima Robots Fail, DNA Stores Everything but the Kitchen Sink Most Viewed New categories of dinosaur family tree proposed by scientists Earthquakes could cause Los Angeles area to sink abruptly: study Lip-reading program more accurate than humans could help hearing-impaired Trump approves human exploration of Mars and signs off on NASA's budget Waste not on World Water Day: Bob McDonald World saw record temperatures in 2016 — and it's getting warmer: study Strep infections that could threaten your life Rusty-patched bumblebee first of species declared endangered in continental U.S. Tiger crushed to death by rescue workers in northern India Archeologists find 400,000-year-old cranium fossil related to Neanderthals Don't Miss How Canadians are keeping Black Lives Matter website online The Current Fun and games: Why we should take time to play Antimatter Scientists measure antimatter atom for 1st time Blog Climate change as seen from space: Bob McDonald Who would want access to 1 billion Yahoo accounts?

While there, I decided I wanted to get a pedicure. My search turned into quite the adventure — one that involved cutting edge translation technology, and a key word lost in translation. Google and Baidu (which is often referred to as China's Google) have built voice translation apps, available here and here. You speak into them, they listen and then they translate into the language you choose. They do it in writing, by displaying text on the screen as you talk; and out loud, by using your phone's speaker to narrate what you've said once you're done talking. These robot translators can radically change your experience in a foreign land — or at least that's what happened for me. Though it was not a promising start. A small miracle I was in the city of Zhengzhou. It was 10 p.m. and I had cabin fever. For days I'd felt stuck in the tourist vortex, and the Internet said that just four kilometers away, there was a late-night pedicure salon open. Apps like Google Translate could radically change your experience traveling abroad. Google Translate/Screenshot by NPR hide caption toggle caption Google Translate/Screenshot by NPR A hotel concierge put me in a cab. Using my Baidu Translate app, I asked him: "Will [the driver] put on the meter for the taxi?" I wanted to make sure I wouldn't get charged inflated prices for a quick ride. But he didn't quite understand. The translation was butchered. No matter. I took off anyway. The driver dropped me at a crowded corner, but I didn't see the salon. And I couldn't read the numbers on the buildings. It's all Chinese. So I walked into a store and went up to a woman inside. I shoved the address and my phone in her face. And a small miracle happened. She spoke slowly and clearly, and the app began to transcribe. I read the words on my screen: "Go forward 10 meters and turn right." This is mind-blowing. The directions are so specific, something you could never get with just body language. I thanked her (undoubtedly butchering the word for "thank you") and set off. I turned the corner, just as she instructed, and I saw a storefront with feet on the window. I had arrived. "Pedicure" Only it's not quite what I had in mind. Turns out the pedicure salon was actually a dingy hole-in-the-wall, kind of like a dive bar. Aging men were paying to get their enormous callouses pounded down and their toenails scraped with large, surgical-looking scalpels. All Tech Considered Machines, Lost In Translation: The Dream Of Universal Understanding I decided to stick around because, hey, it's an authentic local experience. Trouble is, my translation apps kept crashing. It could be because the Internet connection was weak. The apps need the Internet to work. I tried to ask the lady attending to me about the service options: What do I get for one hour exactly? She spoke into my phone over and over, and I got this broken non-sentence back — with a key word repeated.

Note the long pauses between each speaker and the translator. The delays could be because of a poor Internet connection, or because of background noise. Money! The lady wanted me to pay 88 yuan (a little less than $13). She put me in a torn faux leather recliner, right across from a drunk guy who was shouting non-stop and threw his complimentary green tea to the floor. This is my Chinese "pedicure." Experts weigh in "That actually raises a good issue, which is that there's a lot more to translation than mapping one word to another," says Macduff Hughes. "The cultural understanding is something that's hard to fully capture just in translation." Hughes is translation chief at Google, in charge of the main app I used in China. I went to his office in Mountain View, Calif., and it turns out, he's more critical of the app than I am. All Tech Considered Turn On, Tune In, Transcribe: U.N. Develops Radio-Listening Tool Hughes says Google has worked for nearly two decades to perfect search so that even if you (the user) don't quite know the words for what you want or can't spell them, Google helps you figure it out. Hughes wants the translation tool to do that: not just fixate on grammar, syntax and diction, but pay attention to intent and cultural differences. "You can imagine that if in addition to translating the word 'pedicure' from English to Chinese, we had shown you some pictures of Chinese pedicure salons, that might have been more helpful to you," he says. Google and Baidu use machine learning to power their translation technology. Here's how it works, in principle: you could have a human linguist dictate all the rules for going from one language to another. But that would be tedious, and yield poor results because a lot of languages aren't structured in parallel form. So instead, these companies have moved to pattern recognition through "neural machine translation." They take a mountain of data — really good translations — and load it into their computers. Algorithms then mine through the data to look for patterns. The end product is translation that's not just phrase-by-phrase, but entire thoughts and sentences at a time. Wu Hua and Zhao Shiqi, leaders with Baidu's translation team, say that according to their data, Chinese nationals traveling abroad — say to Europe or the U.S. — rely on their app to talk with locals. Baidu has also developed an off-line neural translation system, enabling the users to use the translation service when a 3G or better connection isn't available. Pedicure, round 2 Before harping too much on what went wrong for me, let's turn to Chapter 2 of my quest, which took place in Shanghai. Enlarge this image Shanghai pedicurist Ju-wen Zu and NPR's Aarti Shahani talk, aided by a translation app that may change the way we travel abroad forever. Aarti Shahani/NPR hide caption toggle caption Aarti Shahani/NPR Shanghai pedicurist Ju-wen Zu and NPR's Aarti Shahani talk, aided by a translation app that may change the way we travel abroad forever. Aarti Shahani/NPR I spotted a shop with nail polish in the window and the word "pedicure" in English on the door. It felt like a safe bet. I stepped in and used the Google Translate app to ask the pedicurist for her name. She told me it's Ju-wen Zu. Ju-wen was patient, curious and willing to talk with me using this strange new tool. It also helped that the app behaved, and the store was quiet. She put my feet in water that's the perfect temperature, and we chatted just like in salons back home. I learned that Ju-wen's parents are farmers. She's 36 years old and followed her big sister to Shanghai. She met her husband here and has a teenage boy. (A human translator listened to these exchanges and confirmed their accuracy.) I asked her if life in the big city is hard or easy. She answered, and the app said: "Shanghai outsiders difficult place to exist because the housing is very expensive. Rent is also high." I was surprised by how nuanced that answer was. Then Ju-wen and I had this seamless exchange: 'The Housing Is Very Expensive' 1:14 Toggle more options Embed Embed <iframe src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/520832901/520847057" width="100%" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="NPR embedded audio player"> Notice how seamless the conversation can be when the translation app works quickly — translating immediately after a speaker is done talking. I learned that her rent is 3,000 yuan per month and her pay is 8,000 yuan. As I got personal, she got personal too and asked a question women around the world seem to love asking each other: "Do you have a boyfriend?" This experience strikes me as profound. While political leaders, like President Trump, talk about erecting walls and closing borders, technology is marching in the opposite direction, knocking down the most fundamental wall that divides us: language. Technology is enabling this little foray into pedicure diplomacy. "You are awesome!" she told me. I told her she is too. We talked for about an hour this way. Google's Hughes says, "That is fantastic." According to the tech companies' data, my pedicurist and I set a world record of sorts. Google tracks how long conversations typically last, and the vast majority are just three to four exchanges. Baidu says conversations on its translation app average seven to eight exchanges.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's iPhone 8 with Glass Backside may use Physical Direct Connection Technology to Enhance Wireless Charging | Main | IDC sees the Smartwatch eventually dominating the Wearables Market due to an Explosion of new Form Factors & Niches » March 20, 2017 Politics Likely Played a Role in Softbank's Decision to Back Off their Investment in a new Apple Rival Led by Andy Rubin   In January Patently Apple posted a report titled "A Next-Gen Smartphone Designed by Ex-Apple and Google Engineers will Launch Later this Year." One of the key people behind Essential was Android inventor Andy Rubin. It was very surprising to learn that Apple's number one supplier was now working against Apple in backing the new smartphone company. Our report also covered Essential's trademark and patent filings. The patent showed a completely new design methodology for a smartphone and one made with a ceramic back which would technically support wireless charging as reported on earlier today.   Today the Wall Street Journal reports that "SoftBank Group Corp. scrapped a planned $100 million investment in a smartphone startup founded by the creator of Google's Android software, partly because of the Japanese investor's increasingly close relationship with Apple Inc., according to people familiar with the matter."   What's not clear exactly is whether Bloomberg's earlier foxconn references made in January were really a part of the Softbank investment or a separate investment. If it was really a Softbank vision fund investment framed as a Foxconn investment, then that investment is now dead.   However, if it was a true independent Foxconn investment then it's a complication for Apple. Politics could be at play being that Apple is working with Winstron in an Indian iPhone plant and with Pegatron hinting that they would be willing to work with Apple for a plant in the U.S. should they decide to close their Mexican plant.   Was this a part of the true behind the scenes manuevering by Apple to send Softbank and Foxconn a messages to back off their investment in Essentials?   The Wall Street Journal further reported that "The planned investment would have valued the startup, Essential Products Inc., at $1 billion, these people say, a lofty amount for a startup that has yet to sell a product in one of technology's most cutthroat industries. The offer banked on the pedigree of Essential's founder Andy Rubin, who sold his previous startup, Android, to Alphabet Inc. 's Google in 2005, then helped turn its software into the world's most used smartphone operating system, powering devices rivaling Apple's iPhone.   The episode is a window into the unpredictable investing style of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who is set to enhance his position as one of the tech industry's most powerful investors with his $100 billion tech-focused Vision Fund. That mammoth fund is expected to close as early as this month, according to a person familiar with the matter.   As part of the proposed deal with Essential, Mr. Son had promised that SoftBank's telecom subsidiary in Japan would provide a big marketing push for the release of Essential's high-end smartphone, scheduled for this spring, the people said, ahead of Apple's expected fall release of its 10th anniversary iPhone.   In January, Apple agreed to commit $1 billion to the Vision Fund. Though Apple didn't block the Essential deal, according to the people, its investment complicated SoftBank's interest in a competing smartphone company. In February, after months of negotiations and when final investment contracts were being drawn up, Mr. Son backed out of the deal.   Masayoshi Son began discussing an investment with Mr. Rubin last fall, according to people briefed on the talks. They outlined the basic structure of a possible deal, including the funding amount and valuation, as well as plans for SoftBank's mobile subsidiary to put its marketing firepower behind the Japan launch of Essential's first phone. The deal had proceeded to the stage where final investment contracts were being drawn up.   From Mr. Rubin's perspective, the investment was nearly complete, according to people familiar with his thinking, having progressed to the last steps before such venture deals are typically signed. But Mr. Son did another gut check on the deal after Apple committed to investing in his new fund, say people familiar with his thinking, deciding to kill it rather than align himself too closely with an Apple rival."   What may still be hanging in the wind is whether Foxconn is still involved in the deal with Essentials so as to win over the production contract. It may surface in a future report or we may see Apple continually making plant deals with more of Foxconn rivals.   While this ongoing story can't be concluded today with the Wall Street Journal's report, it sure hit a home run in showing us the chess games that companies like Apple have to be constantly playing behind the scenes so as to protect their interests. Business is business and Apple will strike out against a potential enemy or current supplier as needed and do it as quickly as a King Cobra without mercy.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Facebook Twitter Email a day ago Family of Missing Ex-FBI Agent Levinson Files Suit Against Iran The family of a former FBI agent turned CIA consultant who vanished in Iran ten years ago filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the government of Iran, saying it had lied to cover up its role in his detention. The suit seeks damages from Iran for allegedly inflicting emotional distress on the wife and seven children of Robert A. Levinson, a private investigator who was last seen in 2007 on the Iranian island of Kish. He was apparently on an unauthorized CIA mission at the time. The Iranian government says it does not know what happened to Levinson. The family received a proof of life photo in 2011 showing Levinson in an orange jumpsuit holding a sign saying, "HELP ME." Levinson, whose 69th birthday was on March 10, was apparently kidnapped on March 9, 2007. The suit alleges that the Iranian government is using photographs and video of Levinson in captivity to create the false impression that someone other than the government is holding him. This undated handout photo provided by the family of Robert Levinson after they received it in April 2011, shows retired-FBI agent Robert Levinson.\ Levinson family via AP Facebook Twitter Email 2 days ago The FBI Doesn't Call You Up and Ask for Money The FBI is warning the public to beware of calls from the FBI. According to the FBI’s Denver field office, scammers are calling victims from what appears to be an FBI number and telling them they are being investigated by the bureau for violations and owe money. If the victims don’t pay up immediately, the scammers claim, they will be arrested. The scheme has targeted victims throughout the region. "FBI" scammers who have called victims in northern Colorado have been able to "spoof" an actual phone number from an FBI office in the western part of the state, meaning the FBI number is fraudulently displayed by caller ID. The FBI strongly suggests that given the rushed and threatening nature of the calls, victims should hang up on the scammer right away and contact their local FBI field office. Last year, the FBI’s St. Louis, Missouri Division issued a news release warning the public about a similar spoofing scam in which a fake FBI agent told victims the bureau was investigating a tax violation. Scammers spoofed numbers from the FBI’s offices in Eastern Missouri to call victims in Western Missouri.  “These are old scams that keep evolving with a new twist,” said William Woods, special agent in charge of the FBI St. Louis Division. “Just remember, the FBI does not call or e-mail private citizens to demand money or threaten arrest.” Facebook Twitter Email 2 days ago Trump Organization Rushes To Register Trump Tower After NBC News Call After NBC News contacted The Trump Organization on Tuesday to let the firm know it was in violation of New York City law for not registering Trump Tower, the company has completed the necessary paperwork and registered the property. The Trump Organization, the umbrella corporation for Donald Trump's holdings, owns the skyscraper at 725 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and is headquartered there. Donald and Melania Trump have a penthouse in the tower and Trump's sons also maintain offices in the building. Property owners of certain residential buildings are required by city law to register with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development every year, but Trump Tower’s registration expired in 2016 and The Trump Organization never renewed it. Failing to register can result in a fine of up to $500, and revokes some of the rights usually enjoyed by property owners. On Tuesday morning, NBC News contacted The Trump Organization. Not long after, according  to city officials, a representative of The Trump Organization sent the necessary paperwork to the agency. "This was an inadvertent clerical error that has since been remedied," a spokesperson for the Trump Organization told NBC News.   Trump Tower in New York in May 2016. Jason Szenes / EPA, file Facebook Twitter Email 2 days ago Trump's Business Is In Violation of New York City Law Donald Trump’s business, The Trump Organization, is in violation of New York City law, NBC News has learned. The Trump Tower skyscraper located at 725 Fifth Avenue -- where President Trump and Melania live in the penthouse apartment and his two eldest sons work in offices just below -- is not registered this year with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development, a spokeswoman for the department confirmed on Tuesday. Property owners of certain residential buildings are required by law to register annually by Sept. 1, but Trump Tower’s registration expired in 2016 and The Trump Organization did not renew it until today. Failing to register can result in a fine of up to $500, and revokes some of the rights usually enjoyed by property owners. The Trump Organization has a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower. The loan was written by Wall Street firm Ladder Capital Financial and it now resides in a trust and has been securitized. The managing agent on the expired registration for Trump Tower is listed as the Trump Corporation. The “head officer” is Richie Ukaj, whose LinkedIn profile says he is the resident manager at The Trump Organization. The “officer” is listed as Sonja Talesnik, whose LinkedIn profile says she is the assistant general counsel and vice president, property administration at The Trump Organization. Calls and messages to a spokeswoman for The Trump Organization were not immediately returned. Facebook Twitter Email 3 days ago Royal Jordanian Tells Passengers U.S. Is Barring Electronic Devices From Its Flights Royal Jordanian Airlines told passengers on flights to and from the U.S. Monday that because of a directive from the U.S. government, no laptops and other electronic devices could be brought into the cabin of a plane. In messages posted on both Twitter and Facebook and now deleted, the international carrier said cellphones and electronic devices needed for medical reasons could be carried on-board,but everything else had to be stowed in checked baggage "following instructions from the concerned U.S. departments."  The directive takes effect Tuesday, and applies to flights to and from New York, Chicago, Detroit and Montreal.  According to a Royal Jordanian spokesperson, so far there is no time frame and the airline has no information about any directives that may have been issued to other carriers. Royal Jordanian will provide an update with more details on Tuesday. Post by NBC News. Facebook Twitter Email 3 days ago Companies Pull Ads From Google, YouTube Over Racist, Terrorist Content Major European clients are pulling their ad dollars out of Google and YouTube because of fears that their ads will end up next to videos promoting terrorism, racism and hate, and earn money for the extremists who posted the content. Three of Britain’s biggest banks just removed their ads from Google when they saw their campaigns appearing next to extremist content. According to Adweek and the Guardian, ad agency giant Havas Worldwide has also yanked all its ad money out of Google and YouTube in Britain, after Havas and Google couldn’t agree on how to keep the ads of French firm’s clients away from videos of terrorists and white supremacists. McDonald’s, Audi, and the U.K. government have already stopped using the platforms in the U.K., amid concerns that extremist groups will earn money from their advertising. When an ad appears alongside a YouTube video, the individual or organization that posted video earns a small amount of money per viewing of the video.   Facebook Twitter Email 6 days ago Secret Service Racks Up Bills for Trump Kids' Trips. Next Stop Aspen? President Donald Trump's family is reportedly headed to the ski resort town of Aspen this weekend, a trip that could cost taxpayers a pretty penny in security costs judging by the clan's recent globe-trotting. The Trump family visit to Aspen has not been officially announced, but the Aspen Times, quoting anonymous local law enforcement sources, reported Thursday that Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump and their families were expected and that the Secret Service had met with the Aspen Police Department. There are no hotel bills for Aspen in the Federal Procurement Data System yet, but the database does show a $12,208.25 contract by the Secret Service with Aspen Valley Ski/Snowboard Club for "recreational good rental/ski equipment lease" between the dates of March 10 and March 23. No further details were given, and the club's spokeswoman did not respond to requests for more information. Federal documents examined by NBC News outline hotel bills for the U.S. Secret Service and State Department coinciding with other out-of-town visits by Trump's sons and daughters, including: $53,155.25 during Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump's business trip to Vancouver in late February. $16,738.36 during Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump's business trip to Dubai in mid-February. $97,830 for Eric Trump's business trip to Uruguay in early January. In addition, the records show the Secret Service spent $4,0162.02 on rental vehicles in the Dominican Republic on Jan. 29, just ahead of Eric Trump's business visit to Cap Cana.

Pentagon Asks Employees Not to Watch March Madness March Madness is not a threat to our national security, but Pentagon officials are giving employees their annual reminder not to go crazy over college basketball. In an email sent Wednesday night, the Defense Department asked workers not to stream games from the tournament or they would feat up the Pentagon’s valuable internet bandwidth, and slow down the computers that run the U.S. military: "Your JSP support team acknowledges and appreciates that college basketball fans within the DoD are excited to cheer on their favorite teams, update brackets, and otherwise obsess over the Big Dance." "Please keep in mind; if you’re streaming video to watch your favorite player shooting free throws, you’re consuming network resources that could be served to support the Warfighter." Facebook Twitter Email 7 days ago Russians Got Flynn to Take a Pay Cut for Moscow Speech Documents released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee show a representative from RT, the Russian television network, successfully negotiating a lower speaking fee from Mike Flynn, the retired general who served briefly as Donald Trump’s national security advisor before stepping down amid questions about his foreign ties. Flynn spoke at an RT conference in December 2015, and was famously seated at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin. The documents released this afternoon by the Oversight Democrats show Flynn’s booking agent for speeches, a company called Leading Authorities, negotiating logistics for the visit with the head of marketing for RT, a state-sponsored broadcaster. Click Here to Read the Documents While critics have suggested that Flynn was influenced by Russian money, the email chain shows RT asking for a discount, and getting a quick yes from Flynn’s rep. “Sorry it took us longer to get back to you” writes Alina Mikhaleva of RT on Nov. 9, 2015, “but the problem is that the speaking fee is a bit too high and exceeds our budget at the moment, so we had to negotiate it with the management. Do you think there is any possibility to reduce the price to 45K?” Flynn’s rep responds, “Great news! He has accepted (followed by a smiley face emoticon) … I can get a contract over to you stat.” The size of the fee Flynn originally requested is not in the document, but at the time Leading Authorities was asking for up to $55,000 for appearances in Europe and $75,000 for events in Asia, according to Yahoo News.  The top Republican and top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Defense Department on Feb. 17 saying they were looking into Flynn's speaking engagements. "We are attempting to determine the amount Lieutenant General Flynn received for his appearance, the source of the funding, and whether he may have received payments from any other foreign sources for additional engagements," wrote Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R.-Utah, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D.-Maryland. Facebook Twitter Email advertisement advertisement Top stories J.

Name: Subject: Message: Android 7.1.2 beta 2 finally brings notification fingerprint gesture support to Nexus 6P Newsby Jimmy Westenberg3 days ago 15 1115 26 When the first beta version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat was announced back in January, it came as no surprise that not many new features were present. Google originally said it was meant to be an incremental maintenance release focused on refinements and bug fixes, and for the most part, that was true. That is, except for Nexus 5X owners who got a little somethin’ extra. Google brought a handy feature to the Nexus 5X that allows users to swipe down on the fingerprint sensor to reveal the notification shade. This feature was present on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, along with most recent phones from Huawei. If you’ve never used a phone with this little feature, it’s super helpful, especially on bigger phones… like the Nexus 6P. Unfortunately, when the Nexus 6P’s 7.1.2 beta update finally arrived (and arrived late, I might add), this feature wasn’t present. Odd, I know, but Google clearly struggled a bit with getting this update out on time. Now Google has just started rolling out the second Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta update to Pixel and Nexus owners, and whaddya know, the feature has finally been added to the Nexus 6P! I’ve only had a few minutes to test it out so far, but it’s been working pretty well for me. Just enable the toggle under the Moves section of the settings menu, and you’ll be able to swipe down on the fingerprint sensor to bring down the notification shade. You also swipe down again to access your quick settings, and swipe up on the sensor to collapse the notification shade, too. Are you a Nexus 6P owner? If so, are you happy to see this new feature added? Let us know in the comments.

Seems the company is exploring AR glasses, like Google did with Google Glass, and will target our eyes after tackling the iPhone. Apple has plans for augmented reality, or AR, glasses Insider sources speaking with Bloomberg say Apple plans to put AR-enabled glasses on our faces after it brings the features to the iPhone. Apple’s glasses will reportedly pair with the iPhone to display information, video, maps, other images that overlay what you’re seeing. The lead for Apple’s AR project includes a former Dolby executive, presumably Mike Rockwell. He ran Dolby’s Advanced Technology Group and was part of the Dolby Vision display team and was involved in the company’s mobile products, too. He also served as an advisor for Meta, which already makes AR glasses. Other team members previously worked on Microsoft’s HoloLens and the Oculus, now owned by Facebook. Apple’s Augmented Reality Vision Moving into the AR space seems like an obvious move for Apple since company CEO Tim Cook already confirmed it’s an area he’s keenly interested in. The iPhone is a good place to start since it includes cameras and it’s an always with you device. Moving into glasses, however, will be a more tricky prospect. When Google Glass was the hot tech topic Mr. Cook pointed out that wearing glasses is something you do because you have to, and not because you want to. Making glasses with the radios, cameras, and projectors they’d need for an AR experience are bulky. So far the products we’ve seen in that space reflect that and are less than stylish, to say the least. Apple will need to figure out how to make glasses that are light weight, comfortable, and good looking. That’s no small task because they’ll need batteries, antennas, cameras, projectors, and possibly microphones, too. The company still has plenty of time to figure that out because its AR project for the iPhone is still in the development phase. Apple’s glasses won’t come until some time after AR finds its way onto the iPhone, and considering the company already knows glasses are a hard sell it’s a safe bet the team is working hard to get everything right.

Google has baked in some basic customization options for those looking to personalize the new tab page and there’s plenty more manipulation to be had if you venture into the world of extensions. By default, the New Tab page shortcuts are populated based on recently visited websites. Removing a site from the list is as easy as hovering over the thumbnail and clicking the “X” in the top right corner. In the event you remove a site by accident, simply clicking “Undo” or “Restore all” will undo the last edit or start you over fresh. It goes without saying that simply closing out a thumbnail will not impact your browsing history (hence why thumbs can be recovered with a single click). Go Blank or Add a Default New Page If you’re worried about having your browsing history show up on the New Tab page, you can always make the page blank. This can be accomplished using an extension like Empty New Tab Page or Blank New Tab Page from the Chrome Web Store. Constantly clearing our your history or surf in Incognito Mode would be an alternative as well. Optionally, you can replace the New Tab page with a website of your choosing by using an extension such as Replace New Tab Page. Setup is simple and once configured, each new tab will open the website you specify. Make It Your Own There are a wealth of additional Chrome extensions that modify and add all sorts of additional functionality to the New Tab page. It's up to you how far you want to go down the rabbit hole here, however we'd suggest, depending on your browsing habits, go with something that adds a little eye candy or adds to your productivity by adding single-click access to frequently visited sites (Opera/Safari Speed Dial style). Momentum replaces your new tab page with a calm yet powerful and customizable page, which brings you cool daily wallpapers, weather info, search, an inspirational quote and to-do list which can be tied to your account in Wunderlist, Trello, or Google Tasks. Dream Afar is somewhat similar to Momentum, it's as slick and customizable, but with more emphasis on search and it does keep an unobtrusive speed dial at the bottom of the page. Dayboard is a popular extension that replaces your new tab page with a minimal to-do list. The idea is to set up to 5 goals each day and kill those off one by one with less distractions. Dayboard will keep a history to show you your progress and can keep tasks in sync on different machines. If what you want is strictly a Speed Dial extension, there are a handful of good ones to pick from. TabMark (screenshot below) and Speed Dial 2 are both popular and well reviewed. For pure eye candy purposes, Google's own Earth View from Google Earth extension displays a beautiful satellite image from Google Earth every time you open a new tab. It will also let you save those images to be used as desktop wallpapers. Unfortunately there is no usable UI on top of the wallpapers, we wish Google added minimalistic speed dial functionality to go with the mouthwatering satellite photos. It’s worth noting that you’ll want to pay close attention to the permissions that some extensions will ask for. For example, another extension called "Speed Dial 3" which we don't recommend installing, offers quick access to your apps, bookmarks and history, but it can read and change all your data on the websites you visit, read and change your browsing history and read and change your bookmarks. That’s a lot of power to relinquish for the sake of convenience; just know what you’re getting yourself into before adding a given extension. Add a Theme If you prefer to keep Google's utilitarian New Tab page, know you can add themes that introduce backgrounds and additional styling without adding extensions in the mix. Trying a theme is as simple as installing it from the Chrome Web Store; if you don’t like it, just go to the Settings menu in Chrome and click “Reset to default theme.” I’m a bit surprised that Google hasn’t baked more customization options directly into the New Tab page interface although on the other hand, keeping things simple is rarely a bad idea. Such is especially the case considering there’s a robust extension marketplace full of options to add additional flexibility at your own discretion. 5 days, 5 killer tech tips is a TechSpot monthly feature On the third week of every month, we'll publish 5 killer tech tips, one for each day of the week for a given app, service, or platform.

Whether you're new to Google Maps or a veteran, let's take a look at the best ways to get the most out of it. Save Your Home and Work Addresses First things first, adding in your home and work address makes using Google Maps a little more pleasant, because it simplifies navigating to either place. Tap the three-line menu bar in the search box, then Your Places, and add your home and work address. Add Multiple Destinations to a Trip Need to snag some lunch on a long road trip? Or stop off at the pharmacy on your way home from work? Setting up multiple destinations makes that easy, though it's easy to miss that it's even an option. You have two different ways to add multiple stops. First, map out directions to your final destination like you always do. Then, tap the three-dot icon in the top right corner > Add Stop. Enter a second location and Maps will navigate you between them. You can add up to nine different stops here. Alternately, you can add a stop along your route midway through a drive. This makes the most sense for something like snagging lunch on a road trip or if you're walking around a city in need of a quick cup of coffee. Go ahead and start up navigation to your final destination. Once Maps is navigating, tap the big search button, then search for whatever you need. Maps will only show you options along your current route. Save Your Parking Spot In the most recent version of Google Maps, you can have Google save your parking spot. When you park, you'll see a pop-up that asks you to save your location. Do so and you can then add additional info, like what lot you're in or how much time is on your meter. This feature is brand new, so if you don't see it right now keep an eye out for it over the coming weeks. Use Maps to Save Locations You're Interested In Depending on how you use Google Maps, you have a couple of handy ways to save locations. Historically, My Maps, was always the go-to, but that requires that you have access to a desktop computer. Head to the My Maps site on your computer, and you can create a private or public map that's accessible in Google Maps on your phone. This is handy if you're trying to create an itinerary for a holiday, planning out an event, or you're working on a collaborative map with friends. The Best Ways To Use Google's New My Maps Tool Yesterday, Google updated its long-forgotten My Maps tool. The service has been masquerading as Maps Engine Lite, but with a new release, a shiny new Android app, and integration with Google Maps proper, it's worth knowing just what all you can do with it. Read more Perhaps more useful when you're on the go is a new lists feature. Search for a location in Google Maps, then tap the Save button. Here, you'll find a list of your places, included pre-defined lists called Favourites, Want to Go and Starred Places. You'll also see an option to add that location to a custom list or to create a new list entirely. I've found these lists helpful for both planning holidays and keeping track of things I want to do when I'm home. They also come in handy when you have family in town and desperately need to find a good restaurant you've been to nearby. You can also share these lists or make them public. This means that even if you don't do the legwork to plan a holiday, you can reap the rewards of someone more organised than you. Google Maps Now Lets You Organise Your Favourite Places Into Shareable Lists If you wanted to save a location in Google Maps, for years your only option was to add a little star icon. Google's improving this process now by letting you add places to custom lists. Read more Look at Your History to See Every Trip You've Taken By default, Google Maps keeps a running history of every trip you've taken. This is either very cool and useful or very creepy. Tap the three line menu button, then Settings > Map History. Here, you'll see all the different places you've navigated to. If you don't like that Google Maps does this, you can disable it by flipping the toggle at the top of the screen to Off. I personally don't see any use in keeping a history because I'm not an amnesiac in a Christopher Nolan movie, but you might find it useful yourself. Use the Explore Button to Find Interesting Places Around You If you're in a new place and have no idea where to start, the Explore button is incredibly useful. Tap the three-line menu button, then Explore. You'll see a list of food options, cafes and bars. I ignored this little feature for a long time, but ever since I accidentally tapped it one time I use it pretty frequently. Download Maps for Offline Viewing If you have a bad data plan with your phone or you're travelling internationally, offline maps are a must. Search for a city or place name, then tap the name or address on the bottom bar. Tap the Download button to save that map. You can see what you've saved by tapping the three line menu button in the search bar, then tapping Offline Areas. In most cases, you can still navigate and search for destinations in this mode. Google Maps Offline Mode Gets Navigation, Destination Search And More Android. Google Maps is getting an update today that will add in a ton of information to downloaded offline maps. Beyond just being easier to download, you also get turn-by-turn navigation, location search, and more. Read more Zoom One-Handed If you're walking around with your phone trying to navigate with Google Maps, pinching to zoom is tough. Instead, double-tap on the screen, then drag your finger up and down. This zooms in and out on the map. Send Directions from Your Computer to Your Phone If you're looking at directions to a place on your computer and want to do the actual navigation on your phone, you can send that data to your phone as long as you're logged into your Google account on both devices. First, search for a destination and find a route. Once you do, you'll see an option to send the directions to your phone (or car, if it supports Google Maps). Dig Deeper Into Transit Directions If you use public transit, Google Maps is a fantastic way to get around and Google does a pretty good job of providing you with a lot of search parameters to fine tune your search results. Search for a destination in Google Maps, then tap the public transportation button. Here, you'll see a list of the various ways to get to your destination. If you need to change the time around, tap the Depart at button and change that to whatever option you need. You can also tap the options button to fine-tune your results, including which forms of public transportation you want to use (or not use), and change how much walking you to do. The Last Transit Mode You Used Will Always Be the Default If you use a lot of different modes of transportation and bounce between different styles of directions, then you might have noticed that Google saves the your last used mode as the default. So, if you got walking directions last time, you'll get walking directions in your next search. You can always change modes by tapping the big transit mode icon on the search results and then picking the mode you want from the options bar. Avoid Highways, Tolls and Other Options Sometimes, you don't want to deal with highway driving. On those days, it's nice to force Google Maps to steer clear of highways. Enter in your destination, then tap the three dot icon in the top right. Tap the Route options button. Here, you can choose to avoid highways, tolls and ferries. More importantly, you can also toggle whether Google Maps uses your options for every trip or just this one. If you want to always avoid highways, tolls or ferries, set the Remember Settings toggle to on. If you want to do so for only this trip, set it to off. I prefer to leave it in the off position so I don't accidentally get routed some weird way because I forgot to turn highways back on. Adjust Your Guidance Volume and Where It Plays You wouldn't think that something like guidance volume would matter, but if you're driving around in a car with weird speakers, it's nice that Google gives you a lot of options. Tap the three line icon in the search bar, then Settings > Navigation Settings. Here, you can set the volume to soft, normal or loud. You can also choose whether the voice navigation plays over Bluetooth or not. You can even mute navigation completely, or choose the "Alerts Only" function so you're only alerted to traffic, construction or accident alerts.

ST. STEPHEN, S.C. >> Eighth-grader Lakaysha Governor spends two hours on the bus getting back and forth to school each day. Thanks to a grant from Google, she can now use that time more productively and get her homework done. The aspiring forensic anthropologist is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina’s rural Berkeley County who will ride to school on one of 28, Google-funded, Wi-Fi-equipped school buses unveiled Monday. The tech giant also has given the school district 1,700 Chromebooks, the stripped-down laptops on which many schoolchildren now do their class and homework. As more class assignments and homework migrate online, such long bus rides have generally counted as lost time in preparing for the next school day. But Google said it hopes to help expand the use of Wi-Fi on school buses in other rural areas elsewhere around the country. Google has at least a decade-long relationship with Berkeley County, where it’s invested more than $1 billion in data center complexes since 2007, bringing more than 100 jobs. Google says it also has awarded nearly $2 billion in grants to local schools and nonprofits. Google hopes to see the Wi-Fi program extended into other rural areas of the U.S., including locations where it already has data centers that process search queries and other information, according to Lilyn Hester, a Google spokeswoman based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The first such effort was launched last year in Caldwell County, North Carolina, where a data center already exists. The expansions are also needs-based, Hester said, and Google is focusing on rural places where broadband internet access has been slow to spread. “Why don’t we make that instructional time?” Hester said of officials who have mused about the time many students spend on school buses. Google is also looking for ways to make the high-tech buses useful outside of school hours, working with the school district and community on places the buses can go once the school day is done to bring connectivity elsewhere, such as a community center or fellowship hall. Lakaysha, the eight-grader who has her eye on Harvard, has internet access at home like most of her friends. But thanks to the WiFi buses, she can get ahead on her work. Teachers are happy, she said, because “more students are doing their homework.” And she said even rambunctious preschoolers aboard the bus are quieter in the mornings while older students are doing homework. “Now that we have the Chromebooks and the WiFi, they’re kind of quiet; so it’s good for everybody.” Get the latest news by email Sign Up Share this: PREV NEXT Most Read Fukumoto says aloha to GOP Trump: ‘Somewhat’ vindicated after surveillance briefing 5 dead in vehicle, knife attack at British Parliament Sears has ‘substantial doubt’ about its future State sweeps Diamond Head homeless encampments Comments () By participating in online discussions you acknowledge that you have agreed to the TERMS OF SERVICE.

SHARES There's a science to achieving your goals, and Isaac Newton's law of motion does a good job of summing it up: Objects that are at rest stay at rest, while objects in motion stay in motion. And as former Google career coach Jenny Blake tells CNBC, "Being stuck in one place for too long is not going to work." Blake personally helped more than 1,000 people advance while at Google and lays out her wisdom in "Pivot: The Only Move that Matters is Your Next One." She says there are specific strategies any professional can use to stop feeling stuck. Here are methods ways she suggests for giving your life and your career a boost: 1. Draw a "mind map" A "mind map" is a visual diagram of your interests and goals, and drawing one can help you recognize what's important to you. Write the year in the center of a piece of paper, and then draw spokes with different themes that are important to you. Your spokes, for example, could include personal life, career, health and fitness or skill building. Then, for each one of those themes, add additional spokes for specific goals in that area. "It's my favorite way to brainstorm," says Blake. show chapters Kickstart your new year with this visual trick    Monday, 19 Dec 2016 | 2:48 PM ET | 01:04 2. Think of personal or work projects you could start If you're lacking a sense of excitement or challenge at work or in your personal life, create it. "Start asking, 'What projects am I most excited to tackle in terms of what I can learn the most from?'" Blake tells CNBC. Personal side projects, or "pivots" as Blake likes to call them, can be starting a blog, reading a list of books on a new topic, taking a course or building something from scratch. Work pivots can be taking on a new responsibility in your current role or asking your boss if you could explore a new opportunity. Doing these small projects will give you a sense of purpose and add fun to your life, she says. They also take the pressure off of feeling like you have to have one all-consuming passion in life, which many people don't. 3. Focus on the skills you'd like to have The days of landing a great job simply by rising through the ranks of a company are in the past, according to the career coach. "A career is not a ladder anymore," Blake says. Instead, the best way to continue to rise in your career is by building a cache of skills that make you valuable. For example, if you know you need to know more about a certain subject, or improve your collaboration, writing or technology skills, find a way to learn that skill either inside or outside of the office. Pursuing even one skill to develop will give you a sense of personal or professional progress. show chapters Your career is like a smartphone, says a former Google career coach    Wednesday, 30 Nov 2016 | 8:30 AM ET | 00:57 4. Don't stay stuck because of fear The biggest mistake people make in their careers and in their personal lives, the career expert says, is not doing anything because they are scared. If you're worried something, figure out a plan to address it. Whether it's having a conversation with your boss, asking for help or making more time for yourself, moving is better than staying still, Blake says. "A lot of people ask, 'What if I make the wrong move? What if I make the wrong decision?'" she says. "But almost no one — in fact, no one — that I spoke with regretted their pivots." Check out what Blake's advice for what to do if you've hit a career plateau show chapters Former Google career coach shares tips on what to do if you hate your job    Wednesday, 9 Nov 2016 | 9:00 AM ET | 01:39 Marguerite WardReporter, CNBC Make It Primetime Shows Watch full episodes | TV schedule To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

The apology from Matt Brittin, president of Google's Europe, Middle East and Africa division, came after UK banks HSBC and RBS, along with major retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S), decided to suspend their adverts from appearing on platforms such as YouTube. "I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Brittin said in a statement. "We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously". Brittin said Google was already making improvements thanks to increased investment - resulting in it "raising the bar for our ads policies, simplifying advertiser controls and adding safer defaults". Refunded payments HSBC said in a statement on Monday it takes "breach of our digital advertising standards very seriously and have put advertising with Google on hold at this time". An M&S spokesperson added: "In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through." The British arm of French advertising agency Havas suspended such advertising last week. Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, are the BBC, Guardian newspaper group and McDonalds UK. In the UK, a committee of MPs has meanwhile demanded that Google explain how government adverts have appeared on "inappropriate and hate-filled sites" and whether the government and advertisers will be refunded payments made to the US tech giant.

Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images Business (Australia) Australian advertising industry holds talks to protect brands against extremist content Australian Association of National Advertisers says digital media supply chain needs to be cleaned up Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Amanda Meade Monday 20 March 2017 16.00 EDT Last modified on Monday 20 March 2017 18.15 EDT The Australian advertising industry is holding talks this week aimed at curbing unsafe digital media advertising that damages brands amid a backlash in the UK against Google’s advertising practices. The chief executive of the Australian Association of National Advertisers, Sunita Gloster, said local brands wanted to be confident their ads would not end up next to extremist or other undesirable content. Last week the Guardian withdrew online advertising from Google and YouTube after it emerged that its ads were being inadvertently placed next to extremist material via Google’s AdX ad exchange. Google braces for questions as more big-name firms pull adverts Read more “As [Procter and Gamble’s] Marc Pritchard said in his four-point global action plan for cleaning up the digital media supply chain – the time for talking is over,” Gloster said. In a frank speech earlier this year, Pritchard said: “We have a media supply chain that is murky at best and fraudulent at worst. We need to clean it up and invest the time and money we save into better advertising to drive growth.” Traditional media advertising has been rapidly replaced by computerised, or programmatic, advertising systems, where the parties transact digitally in a similar way to buyers and sellers on the auction site eBay. This means advertisers have no control over where their ads end up. Gloster’s industry lobby group is holding a media forum in two states this week to address the pitfalls of digital advertising. “Chief marketing officers around the world are now focused on a very significant set of challenges in digital media,” she said. The threat is coming from rising ad fraud from bots and criminal syndicates and the lack of accountability for measuring ads in the global media supply chain, as well as the unpredictability of ad placement. “Advertisers now want fast, decisive action for achieving real transparency and accountability through the media supply chain,” Gloster said. “It’s important – media is the biggest single expense in the marketing budget.” In the UK and France several corporations, advertising firms and government departments are pulling their adverts from Google and its YouTube video site after they were placed next to extremist material. MCN is an Australian agency that sells advertising for Foxtel, Fox Sports and Network Ten. Its chief executive, Anthony Fitzgerald, said brand safety was a big selling point for the agency, which set it apart from YouTube or Facebook. “This is an issue that is growing rapidly,” he said. “There is growing momentum in the market and advertisers are starting to get an understanding of the impact this may be having on their business.” Guardian pulls ads from Google after they were placed next to extremist material Read more Brands could suffer significant damage from being associated with extremist content, he said. “First of all the ads are not going to be effective,” he said. “If you’ve got somebody sitting at a computer and they’re not feeling good and they’re feeling anxious and then they see a pop-up video consisting of hate speech and then a client’s brand ad comes up before, during or after it, you’d have to be thinking, ‘This is not doing my brand health any good.’ “No one is suggesting that Google and Facebook don’t have a place. Google says it believes absolutely in free speech but they don’t yet have the tools in to ensure that their environment is brand safe. “This applies to newspapers as much as it does to broadcast and I am a huge believer in brand safe content. “Most of the advertising that is bought today outside of premium publishers and broadcast networks is bought programmatically and you could probably describe it as not brand safe. “Advertisers should buy their media from premium broadcast and publishers who create, curate and control all the content that they run.” Topics Business (Australia) Australian media Google YouTube The Guardian Facebook news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Google Apologizes To McDonald’s, BBC, For Running Their Ads Alongside Offensive YouTube Clips Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Apologizes To McDonald’s, BBC, For Running Their Ads Alongside Offensive YouTube Clips Image courtesy of Google March 20, 2017 3:22 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler ADS advertising google Looking Into it offensive content pulling ads review youtube Google is apologizing to some very big companies that stopped running YouTube ads after learning that their brands were being featured alongside offensive and hateful videos. Reuters reports that brands including Marks & Spencer, HSBC, the BBC, and McDonald’s pulled ad content from Google sites in the UK after promotions appeared alongside YouTube videos featuring hate speech, gore, and other offensive content. “I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content,” Google EMEA President Matt Brittin said at an Advertising Week Europe event in London. as reported by Reuters. Brittin added that Google has expedited an ongoing comprehensive review of its advertiser policies and controls in order to avoid similar fiascos in the future. Despite this, CNBC reports that several ad firms, including Havas — which handles promotions for Hyundai Kia and Domino’s — have paused ads in the U.K. while they discuss the issues with Google. Meanwhile, firm WPP tells Reuters that it is talking to Google, along with companies like Facebook and Snapchat, about ways in which the companies can ensure that the image of brands advertising on their platforms aren’t adversely affected. Publicis, a French ad firm, tells Reuters that it believes Google has fallen short of meeting advertising standards. CNBC reports that Brittin said at Monday’s conference that is working with the affected companies. “I’ve spoken personally to a number of advertisers,” Brittin said. “Those that I have spoken to, we have been talking about a handful of impressions, and pennies not pounds of spend, but however small or big the issue, it is an important issue that we address.” March 20, 2017 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler ADS advertising google Looking Into it offensive content pulling ads review youtube Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related kids today YouTube Kids Accused Of Running Beer Ads, Crotch-Grabbing Lessons, Wine-Tasting Tips kids today YouTube Kids App Accused Of Deceptive, Excessive Advertising driving out the auto-playing demon Google Chrome Will Block Flash Ads, Auto-Playing Videos Starting Sept. 1 brought to you by the letter $ Expect To See More Ads Pretending To Be Editorial Content All about the toy Ad Board Recommends McDonald’s Focus On Actual Meal, Not Just The Cool Toy Previous Is Your DVR Acting Funny?

Three hours and 20 minutes of debate. Very hard to say who came out on top. Here’s one succinct and trenchant view: Pierre Briançon (@pierrebri) The debate in a nutshell: Fillon isn't dead, Macron needs to work on the gravitas thing, Le Pen fails to score, Mélenchon elbows Hamon out. March 20, 2017 Our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis will be filing her report shortly and the pundits will have their say tomorrow. Le Pen came across as shouty and angry (and seriously flakey on the economy); Fillon mostly quiet but with a few strong moments, particularly on pensions and foreign policy; Macron enthusiastic, idealistic, passionate at times. Conservative commentator Christophe Barbier reckons Le Pen did herself no favours: not presidential, too pugnacious: Christophe Barbier (@C_Barbier) #LeGrandDébat Marine Le Pen à la fois faible en arguments et pugnace en invectives. Peu présidentielle, trop vindicative. March 20, 2017 And Barbier gave the candidates these marks out of 20, conceding they weren’t very scientific: Fillon: 12/20; Hamon: 11/20; Mélenchon : 14/20; Macron: 14/20; Le Pen: 9/20. But all will have pleased their own voters, I imagine. The next few rounds of polls will show whether this evening’s debate made any difference. That’s it from me: good night! Updated at 7.47pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.24pm EDT 19:24 Summing up Fillon: a real change of politics is needed and I’m the only candidate who can deliver it. I’m the only one who could have a stable majority to deliver it. I may have committed a few errors, who hasn’t. But I have experience, and the will to do this. Hamon: I’m offering you a vote that will be useful to you, your children, your grandchildren. You are used to voting against; I suggest you vote for: for the environment, for purchasing power for the poorest families; for a sixth republic; for a desirable future. Le Pen: Most of the promises you’ve heard tonight cannot be put into practice because the EU will prevent them. You, the French, have the right to decide. Uncontrolled globalisation has been a disaster for you. I will do nothing against your will. I will start negotiations with Europe, and I will organise a referendum. I call on you to vote for liberty. If you make the right political choices things will improve immediately. Mélenchon: We cannot affront the threats the world faces with hands tied by money. I want to give the republic back to France by relieving it of this presidential monarchy. I am ready for this responsibility ... to put in place a programme that will upset lots of vested interests. Macron: Thank you for this debate. I want to reconcile opinions. Our country is divided, by fear, and by the way some people play on fear. You are not the problem – the problem is that the established order is not the right one. I propose pragmatism, with zero tolerance. My project is one that will make France proud. Profound change, that’s our project. It’s a profound renewal of French politics. I want France, our country, to offer a chance – a chance for each and every one of you. Updated at 7.26pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.12pm EDT 19:12 Terrorism The debate has now been going on for more than three hours. Chris Terry (@CJTerry) #LeGrandDebat has now become an endurance test. The last Presidential candidate to collapse on stage will triumph. March 20, 2017 Le Pen says to avoid future terrorism attacks must be prevented by regaining control of France’s frontiers, expelling known militants, banning fundamentalist organisations, closing fundamentalist mosques ... “We must give ourselves the means to wage this necessary war against Islamic fundamentalism,” she says. Fillon says the world faces a longterm war that will take a decade at least. It will need alliances with Russia, the Middle East and others, and in the meantime France must secure itself: deporting anyone who has a “proven relationship with the enemy”, stripping French nationality from anyone who takes up arms against his country. Macron says no one can guarantee no new attacks. “It needs responsibility, maturity.” A diplomatic solution in the Middle East; punishment for those who have fought against France; improving intelligence cooperation. Updated at 7.14pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.01pm EDT 19:01 Macron says he is the only candidate who has pledged to fulfil France’s responsibilities to Europe. He says the French people will give him a mandate to defend France’s economic independence and its security. He says France’s place is at the heart of Europe, working with Europe. Le Pen snorts. “You have said nothing,” Le Pen says. “You have talked for seven minutes and said nothing.” Pierre Briançon (@pierrebri) Macron efficient by taking on Le Pen on foreign policy :"I want France's independence within Europe." #FrenchPresidentialDebate March 20, 2017 Updated at 7.02pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.51pm EDT 18:51 France's place in the world The final stage of the debate: foreign policy. Hamon says France should always be capable and willing to intervene militarily abroad in defence of international law. He says Trump and Russia’s ambitions have changed everything: less America (on the world stage) should lead to more Europe, he says. Le Pen says no one should decide for France. “I don’t want to force our soldiers to fight in wars that we have not decided,” she says. The French army is in a parlous state, she says, and defence spending must be raised to 3% of GDP by the end of the next presidency. Fillon says that’s ridiculous: completely unaffordable. Mélenchon says the world has become a dangerous place. He wants to be a president of peace, he says. No war, but negotiations ... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.43pm EDT 18:43 Le Pen has spoken longer and louder than everyone else ... Evan O'Connell (@evanoconnell) Le Pen comes off as angry and incoherent, on health and pensions. But maybe it works for her electorate. #LeGrandDebat March 20, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.39pm EDT 18:39 Healthcare Another lengthy and detailed discussion. Mélenchon says everyone should be reimbursed in full for all their healthcare expenses: “We know how to fund that, it’s not complicated.” Fillon says the system has to be “debureaucratised” and GPs need to be at the heart of the system. They need to be paid properly, to be able to work in teams. Hospitals need to be more independent. Macron also wants healthcare professionals to have more autonomy. Le Pen says France has to cut waste in its healthcare system. As a mother of three, she says, she could have started a pharmacy ... Alexander Clarkson (@APHClarkson) UK observers should note the amount of time healthcare, pensions and employment issues are taking up in the French presidential debate March 20, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.30pm EDT 18:30 There is a lengthy debate on the age of retirement ... Fillon proposes raising the retirement age to 65. Macron says he will reform the pension system from top to bottom. It is unclear and confusing and unfair, he says. One euro paid into the system should be worth one euro at retirement age, he says.

Three of Britain’s biggest banks just removed their ads from Google when they saw their campaigns appearing next to extremist content. According to Adweek and the Guardian, ad agency giant Havas Worldwide has also yanked all its ad money out of Google and YouTube in Britain, after Havas and Google couldn’t agree on how to keep the ads of French firm’s clients away from videos of terrorists and white supremacists. McDonald’s, Audi, and the U.K. government have already stopped using the platforms in the U.K., amid concerns that extremist groups will earn money from their advertising.

Qari Mohammad Yasin, also known as Ustad Aslam, died in a drone strike in Afghanistan's Paktika province. He was linked to an attack ‎on the Pakistani military headquarters in Rawalpindi and an attack on a bus carrying Sri Lanka's national cricket team. "We lost a brave man and the trainer of trainers in a U.S drone attack," said Asad Mansoor, the spokesman of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan Jamaatul Ahrar ( TTP-JA), a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, presently based in Afghanistan.  Yasin was given the title "Ustad," or teacher, because he trained suicide bombers. Facebook Twitter Email a day ago Family of Missing Ex-FBI Agent Levinson Files Suit Against Iran The family of a former FBI agent turned CIA consultant who vanished in Iran ten years ago filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the government of Iran, saying it had lied to cover up its role in his detention. The suit seeks damages from Iran for allegedly inflicting emotional distress on the wife and seven children of Robert A. Levinson, a private investigator who was last seen in 2007 on the Iranian island of Kish. He was apparently on an unauthorized CIA mission at the time. The Iranian government says it does not know what happened to Levinson. The family received a proof of life photo in 2011 showing Levinson in an orange jumpsuit holding a sign saying, "HELP ME." Levinson, whose 69th birthday was on March 10, was apparently kidnapped on March 9, 2007. The suit alleges that the Iranian government is using photographs and video of Levinson in captivity to create the false impression that someone other than the government is holding him. This undated handout photo provided by the family of Robert Levinson after they received it in April 2011, shows retired-FBI agent Robert Levinson.\ Levinson family via AP Facebook Twitter Email 2 days ago The FBI Doesn't Call You Up and Ask for Money The FBI is warning the public to beware of calls from the FBI. According to the FBI’s Denver field office, scammers are calling victims from what appears to be an FBI number and telling them they are being investigated by the bureau for violations and owe money. If the victims don’t pay up immediately, the scammers claim, they will be arrested. The scheme has targeted victims throughout the region. "FBI" scammers who have called victims in northern Colorado have been able to "spoof" an actual phone number from an FBI office in the western part of the state, meaning the FBI number is fraudulently displayed by caller ID. The FBI strongly suggests that given the rushed and threatening nature of the calls, victims should hang up on the scammer right away and contact their local FBI field office. Last year, the FBI’s St. Louis, Missouri Division issued a news release warning the public about a similar spoofing scam in which a fake FBI agent told victims the bureau was investigating a tax violation. Scammers spoofed numbers from the FBI’s offices in Eastern Missouri to call victims in Western Missouri.  “These are old scams that keep evolving with a new twist,” said William Woods, special agent in charge of the FBI St. Louis Division. “Just remember, the FBI does not call or e-mail private citizens to demand money or threaten arrest.” Facebook Twitter Email 2 days ago Trump Organization Rushes To Register Trump Tower After NBC News Call After NBC News contacted The Trump Organization on Tuesday to let the firm know it was in violation of New York City law for not registering Trump Tower, the company has completed the necessary paperwork and registered the property. The Trump Organization, the umbrella corporation for Donald Trump's holdings, owns the skyscraper at 725 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and is headquartered there. Donald and Melania Trump have a penthouse in the tower and Trump's sons also maintain offices in the building. Property owners of certain residential buildings are required by city law to register with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development every year, but Trump Tower’s registration expired in 2016 and The Trump Organization never renewed it. Failing to register can result in a fine of up to $500, and revokes some of the rights usually enjoyed by property owners. On Tuesday morning, NBC News contacted The Trump Organization. Not long after, according  to city officials, a representative of The Trump Organization sent the necessary paperwork to the agency. "This was an inadvertent clerical error that has since been remedied," a spokesperson for the Trump Organization told NBC News.   Trump Tower in New York in May 2016. Jason Szenes / EPA, file Facebook Twitter Email 2 days ago Trump's Business Is In Violation of New York City Law Donald Trump’s business, The Trump Organization, is in violation of New York City law, NBC News has learned. The Trump Tower skyscraper located at 725 Fifth Avenue -- where President Trump and Melania live in the penthouse apartment and his two eldest sons work in offices just below -- is not registered this year with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development, a spokeswoman for the department confirmed on Tuesday. Property owners of certain residential buildings are required by law to register annually by Sept. 1, but Trump Tower’s registration expired in 2016 and The Trump Organization did not renew it until today. Failing to register can result in a fine of up to $500, and revokes some of the rights usually enjoyed by property owners. The Trump Organization has a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower. The loan was written by Wall Street firm Ladder Capital Financial and it now resides in a trust and has been securitized. The managing agent on the expired registration for Trump Tower is listed as the Trump Corporation. The “head officer” is Richie Ukaj, whose LinkedIn profile says he is the resident manager at The Trump Organization. The “officer” is listed as Sonja Talesnik, whose LinkedIn profile says she is the assistant general counsel and vice president, property administration at The Trump Organization. Calls and messages to a spokeswoman for The Trump Organization were not immediately returned.

In messages posted on both Twitter and Facebook and now deleted, the international carrier said cellphones and electronic devices needed for medical reasons could be carried on-board,but everything else had to be stowed in checked baggage "following instructions from the concerned U.S. departments."  The directive takes effect Tuesday, and applies to flights to and from New York, Chicago, Detroit and Montreal.  According to a Royal Jordanian spokesperson, so far there is no time frame and the airline has no information about any directives that may have been issued to other carriers. Royal Jordanian will provide an update with more details on Tuesday. Post by NBC News.

Next Stop Aspen? President Donald Trump's family is reportedly headed to the ski resort town of Aspen this weekend, a trip that could cost taxpayers a pretty penny in security costs judging by the clan's recent globe-trotting. The Trump family visit to Aspen has not been officially announced, but the Aspen Times, quoting anonymous local law enforcement sources, reported Thursday that Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump and their families were expected and that the Secret Service had met with the Aspen Police Department. There are no hotel bills for Aspen in the Federal Procurement Data System yet, but the database does show a $12,208.25 contract by the Secret Service with Aspen Valley Ski/Snowboard Club for "recreational good rental/ski equipment lease" between the dates of March 10 and March 23. No further details were given, and the club's spokeswoman did not respond to requests for more information. Federal documents examined by NBC News outline hotel bills for the U.S. Secret Service and State Department coinciding with other out-of-town visits by Trump's sons and daughters, including: $53,155.25 during Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump's business trip to Vancouver in late February. $16,738.36 during Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump's business trip to Dubai in mid-February. $97,830 for Eric Trump's business trip to Uruguay in early January. In addition, the records show the Secret Service spent $4,0162.02 on rental vehicles in the Dominican Republic on Jan. 29, just ahead of Eric Trump's business visit to Cap Cana.

Pentagon Asks Employees Not to Watch March Madness March Madness is not a threat to our national security, but Pentagon officials are giving employees their annual reminder not to go crazy over college basketball. In an email sent Wednesday night, the Defense Department asked workers not to stream games from the tournament or they would feat up the Pentagon’s valuable internet bandwidth, and slow down the computers that run the U.S. military: "Your JSP support team acknowledges and appreciates that college basketball fans within the DoD are excited to cheer on their favorite teams, update brackets, and otherwise obsess over the Big Dance." "Please keep in mind; if you’re streaming video to watch your favorite player shooting free throws, you’re consuming network resources that could be served to support the Warfighter." Facebook Twitter Email 7 days ago Russians Got Flynn to Take a Pay Cut for Moscow Speech Documents released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee show a representative from RT, the Russian television network, successfully negotiating a lower speaking fee from Mike Flynn, the retired general who served briefly as Donald Trump’s national security advisor before stepping down amid questions about his foreign ties. Flynn spoke at an RT conference in December 2015, and was famously seated at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin. The documents released this afternoon by the Oversight Democrats show Flynn’s booking agent for speeches, a company called Leading Authorities, negotiating logistics for the visit with the head of marketing for RT, a state-sponsored broadcaster. Click Here to Read the Documents While critics have suggested that Flynn was influenced by Russian money, the email chain shows RT asking for a discount, and getting a quick yes from Flynn’s rep. “Sorry it took us longer to get back to you” writes Alina Mikhaleva of RT on Nov. 9, 2015, “but the problem is that the speaking fee is a bit too high and exceeds our budget at the moment, so we had to negotiate it with the management. Do you think there is any possibility to reduce the price to 45K?” Flynn’s rep responds, “Great news! He has accepted (followed by a smiley face emoticon) … I can get a contract over to you stat.” The size of the fee Flynn originally requested is not in the document, but at the time Leading Authorities was asking for up to $55,000 for appearances in Europe and $75,000 for events in Asia, according to Yahoo News.  The top Republican and top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Defense Department on Feb. 17 saying they were looking into Flynn's speaking engagements. "We are attempting to determine the amount Lieutenant General Flynn received for his appearance, the source of the funding, and whether he may have received payments from any other foreign sources for additional engagements," wrote Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R.-Utah, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D.-Maryland. Facebook Twitter Email advertisement advertisement Top stories J.

Billed as Google’s Amazon Alexa competitor, the speaker was supercharged with Google Assistant and the power of Google’s powerful machine learning AI. After all this time, people are quickly starting to realize that maybe Google Home isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be. The problem? The tiny speaker still can’t execute basic Google Assistant commands you can already do on your smartphone. Illustrating this perfectly is Ars Technica’s Ron Amadeo who uploaded a delightful video showing his frustrations with the smart speaker. Take a look: A re-review of Google Home, 7 months in. pic.twitter.com/N5bHZg2iTk — Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) March 20, 2017 Even though we’re almost half a year into its launch, Google Home still can’t “set a reminder,” a basic Google Assistant feature that’s been available for some time now.

"We don't expect this trend to slow down. As hackers get more aggressive and more sites become outdated, hackers will continue to capitalize by infecting more sites," Google said in a post on its webmaster blog. Google, which inserts security warnings when it detects hacked sites, said most of those warned can clean up their pages, but that 61 percent are not notified because their sites are not verified by the search engine. "As always, it's best to take a preventative approach and secure your site rather than dealing with the aftermath," the blog said. "Remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link." The news comes amid growing concerns over cybersecurity in the wake of massive hacks affecting Yahoo, the US government and major e-commerce firms. Google said certain website hacks often follow similar patterns -- some insert "gibberish" on a page, while others create Japanese text that links to fake brand merchandise sites. "Hacking behavior is constantly evolving, and research allows us to stay up to date on and combat the latest trends," Google said.

IN ADDITION, MARKET SOUNDINGS WERE TAKEN IN RESPECT OF THE MATTERS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, WITH THE RESULT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS BECAME AWARE OF SUCH INSIDE INFORMATION. UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS INSIDE INFORMATION IS NOW CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND SUCH PERSONS SHALL THEREFORE CEASE TO BE IN POSSESSION OF INSIDE INFORMATION. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, CAPITALISED TERMS IN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAVE THE MEANING GIVEN TO THEM IN THE DEFINITIONS SECTION INCLUDED IN THE APPENDIX.     mporium Group plc („MPM”, the „Company” or the „Group”)   Company Update and Placing   mporium Group plc (AIM: MPM), the „mobile native” technology company, is pleased to announce its intention to conduct a placing of up to approximately 20 million new ordinary shares of 0.5 pence each in the Company (the „Placing Shares”), at a price expected to be not less than 15 pence per Placing Share (the „Placing”). The expected minimum Placing Price represents the Closing Price on 17 March 2017, being the last practicable trading day prior to the release of this Announcement.   The Placing Shares are being offered by way of an accelerated bookbuild („Bookbuild”), which will be launched immediately following this Announcement. It is anticipated that the Placing will raise approximately £3 million before expenses. The final price and number of the Placing Shares will be determined following the Bookbuild. N+1 Singer will be acting as sole bookrunner in connection with the Bookbuild.   The Placing Shares represent up to approximately 4.1 per cent. of the Company’s existing issued share capital.   Highlights of the Placing   ·     MPM intends to raise approximately £3 million pursuant to the Placing at a price expected to be the Closing Price on 17 March 2017, being the last practicable trading day prior to the release of this Announcement (the „Placing Price”). ·     The net proceeds of the Placing will primarily be used to enable the Group to continue with its IMPACT and INSIGHTS product roll-out, in line with the Group’s existing growth strategy. ·     The Placing is being made under existing authorities and is conditional on, amongst other things, admission of the Placing Shares to trading on AIM. ·     The Bookbuild will close at such time as N+1 Singer and the Company may determine in their absolute discretion. ·     Following the close of the Bookbuild, a further announcement will be made as to the final number of Placing Shares to be issued pursuant to the Placing and the Placing Price, the gross proceeds and the estimated net proceeds.   Background to and reasons for the Placing   MPM is a „mobile native” technology company which uses proprietary technology to monetise the transformation that smartphones have had on consumer digital behaviour: achieving successful digital advertising campaigns on mobile devices, from brand advertising to direct response.   The Company has and continues to develop two technology products – IMPACT and INSIGHTS. The directors have been encouraged by results to date . IMPACT is digital advertising technology that enables campaigns to be managed across Google AdWords, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, by leveraging in real-time, events such as TV content, sports, news, weather and social media. INSIGHTS continues to evolve into a decision making support tool that delivers actionable information to enable users to manage their websites and the digital advertising campaigns that drive web traffic to their websites.   Market opportunity The Company has identified an opportunity to take advantage of the marketing evolution and smartphone revolution. Marketing spend is no longer focused on newspapers and television but rather is trending strongly towards digital marketing. Google’s revenue has increased by more than 10 fold since 2005. In 2016 alone Google global revenue reached an astounding $89.5 billion.   Alongside the marketing evolution we have the smartphone revolution – adoption of smartphones has grown at an unprecedented rate since the launch of the iPhone in June 2007. The number of smartphone users overtook the global number of PC users in 2014 and the gap continues to grow. Critically, while the PC is not a „one per person on the planet” product, the smartphone, for most part, is making it the true device of reach.   It has been estimated that the PC install base will settle around 1 – 1.2 billion while the smartphone install base will settle around 4 – 4.5 billion. It is therefore not surprising that the global digital adspend at the end of 2016 was c.$186 billion of which mobiles accounted for more than 50 per cent. of all digital expenditure.   The solution – IMPACT IMPACT is designed to provide event driven automated and scalable marketing technology in real timing by constantly monitoring for relevant micro moments, identifying those micro-moments and then automatically launching advertising campaigns on the relevant platform(s) for a specific time frame.   The technology enables brands, and the agencies that serve them, to achieve better outcomes from digital advertising campaigns on mobile devices from brand advertising to direct response.     Monetising the micro-moment The Company’s focus is now on generating revenue by exploiting the IMPACT technology that captures and monetizes the micro-moment by establishing relationships with media agencies. Advertisers are demanding to see measurable, targeted performance of their adspend and the IMPACT technology delivers this capability.   As announced, at the end of 2016, following a trial of IMPACT on the digital marketing campaign for one of Jellyfish’s largest blue-chip clients, the Company reached an agreement to provide its IMPACT technology product to Jellyfish. Jellyfish is an independent digital agency which has a global client base which includes Experian, Under Armour, Nestlé, Toyota, Fitbit and Samsung.   Further as recently announced, the Company has entered into a new commercial agreement to provide its IMPACT technology product to Essence, a global digital agency that is majority owned by WPP. This framework agreement gives the Company the exciting opportunity to work with Essence’s global client base and represents another exciting step forward for the Company.   The Company’s business model is to charge a percentage of the advertising spend that IMPACT manages. This model is consistent with the standard agency model and successful adoption will naturally depend on the results and value add which IMPACT can demonstrate.   Preliminary results The Company expects to publish its annual report and accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2016 in late April 2017   For the year to 31 December 2016, the Company expects to report revenues of £1.84m and a cash position of £1.3m at the year end.     Outlook Given the framework agreements the Company is now establishing which gives them access to attractive global clients, the Company is focussing on building those relationships and generating revenues streams from those contracts. The Board believes that the Company’s partnerships with agencies gives the Company an efficient route to market and exciting scalability.    The Placing The proceeds of the Placing will be used to continue with the Company’s current strategy and building on its development of the Group’s IMPACT and INSIGHTS products, to accelerate growth through investment in sales and marketing activities, product development and for general working capital purposes.   The Company will use its existing general share authorities for the issue and allotment of the Placing Shares. The existing authorities were those granted at the Company’s annual general meeting in May 2016 and at the general meeting held in July 2016 (noting that the latter authorities have not been required to be used for the set-up of an external advisory board which the Board has explored but decided not to proceed with at the current time).   Risks and Uncertainties A description of the principal risks and uncertainties associated with the Group’s business and how they are being managed is included in the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 (on pages 8 – 10). The Board considers that these principal risks and uncertainties are those applicable to the Group at the current time. Expected Timetable Closing of the Bookbuild 21 March 2017 Admission and commencement of dealings in the Placing Shares 8.00 a.m. on 24 March 2017   Each of the times and dates refer to London time and are subject to change by the Company (with the agreement of N+1 Singer), in which case details of the new times and dates will be notified to the London Stock Exchange and the Company will make an appropriate announcement through a Regulatory Information Service.   Additional information on the Placing is included below. Attention is drawn to the section headed ‚Important Information’ below and to the Appendix containing the terms and conditions of the Placing (representing important information for Placees only).   The Placing Shares will be allotted under the Company’s existing authorities granted by shareholders of the Company at the annual general meeting held on 18 May 2016 and at the general meeting held on 18 July 2016. The number of Placing Shares to be issued in connection with the Placing will be agreed by MPM and N+1 Singer following the close of the Bookbuild to further orders, and the results of the Placing will be announced as soon as practicable thereafter. The timing of the closing of the book, acceptance of any orders received after a close of Bookbuild announcement, the pricing and final allocations are determined at the absolute discretion of MPM and N+1 Singer. The number of Placing Shares is expected to be up to 20 million and in any event no more than 50 million (representing approximately 9.7 per cent. of the Company’s existing issued share capital). Such number of Placing Shares remains within the Company’s existing shareholder authorities to issue and allot securities on a non pre-emptive basis, which are in accordance with the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles on Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights.   This Announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014 („MAR”). In addition, market soundings (as defined in MAR) were taken in respect of the Placing with the result that certain persons became aware of inside information (as defined in MAR), as permitted by MAR. This inside information is set out in this Announcement. Therefore, those persons that received inside information in a market sounding are no longer in possession of such inside information relating to the Company and its securities.

The Group cautions readers that any forward-looking statement is no guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. A forward-looking statement can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as „aim”, „anticipate”, „target”, „expect”, „estimate”, „intend”, „plan”, „goal”, „believe”, „predict” or other words of similar meaning. Examples of forward-looking statements include, amongst others, statements regarding or which make assumptions in respect of the planned use of the proceeds of the Placing, the liquidity position of the Group, the future performance of the Group, future foreign exchange rates, interest rates and currency controls, the future political and fiscal regimes in the overseas markets in which the Group operates, the Group’s future financial position, plans and objectives for future operations and any other statements that are not historical fact. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances, including, but not limited to, economic and business conditions, the effects of continued volatility in credit markets, market related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities, changes in legislation, the further development of standards and interpretations under International Financial Reporting Standards („IFRS”) applicable to past, current and future periods, evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application of standards under IFRS, the outcome of pending and future litigation or regulatory investigations, the success of future acquisitions and other strategic transactions and the impact of competition. A number of these factors are beyond the Group’s control. As a result, the Group’s actual future results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in the Group’s forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made in this Announcement by or on behalf of the Group speak only as of the date they are made. These forward-looking statements reflect the Group’s judgement at the date of this Announcement and are not intended to give any assurance as to future results. Except as required by the FSA, the London Stock Exchange, the AIM Rules or applicable law, the Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this announcement to reflect any changes in the Group’s expectations with regard thereto or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.   APPENDIX – TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PLACING UNLESS DEFINED BELOW CAPITALISED TERMS ARE AS DEFINED AT THE END OF THIS APPENDIX.

Details of the Placing Agreement and the Placing Shares N+1 Singer has today entered into the Placing Agreement with the Company under which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out therein, N+1 Singer, as agent for and on behalf of the Company, has agreed to use its reasonable endeavours to procure Placees to subscribe for the Placing Shares at the Placing Price, such subscription commitments being conditional upon the conditions (summarised below) being satisfied by the Company or otherwise waived by N+1 Singer. The Placing Shares will, when issued, be subject to the articles of association of the Company and credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Existing Ordinary Shares, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of such Ordinary Shares after the date of issue of the Placing Shares. Application for admission to trading Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for admission of the Placing Shares to trading on AIM. It is expected that Admission will take place at 8.00 a.m. on or around 24 March 2017 and that dealings in the Placing Shares on AIM will commence at the same time. Principal terms of the Placing 1                 N+1 Singer is acting as nominated adviser, financial adviser and broker to the Placing, as agent for and on behalf of the Company. N+1 Singer is authorised and regulated in the United Kingdom by the FCA and is acting exclusively for the Company and no one else in connection with the matters referred to in this Announcement and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company for providing the protections afforded to the customers of N+1 Singer or for providing advice in relation to the matters described in this Announcement. 2                 Participation in the Placing will only be available to persons who may lawfully be, and are, invited by N+1 Singer to participate. N+1 Singer and any of its respective affiliates are entitled to participate in the Placing as principal. 3                 The Placing Price per Placing Share will be payable by all Placees to N+1 Singer (as agent of the Company). The Placing Price and number of Placing Shares will be agreed between the Company and N+1 Singer at the close of the Bookbuild and confirmed to Placees by telephone and/or email along with their final allocation, and will be disclosed in the announcement confirming the result of the Placing. 4                 Each Placee’s allocation is determined by N+1 Singer in its discretion following consultation with the Company and has been or will be confirmed orally by N+1 Singer. That oral confirmation will give rise to an irrevocable, legally binding commitment by that person (who at that point becomes a Placee), in favour of N+1 Singer and the Company, under which it agrees to acquire the number of Placing Shares allocated to the Placee at the Placing Price and otherwise on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this Appendix and in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. Except with N+1 Singer’s written consent, such commitment will not be capable of variation or revocation at the time at which it is submitted. 5                 Following the oral confirmation referred to above, each Placee’s allocation and commitment will be evidenced by a form of confirmation issued to each such Placee by N+1 Singer. The terms of this Appendix will be deemed incorporated in that form of confirmation. 6                 Each Placee will have an immediate, separate, irrevocable and binding obligation, owed to N+1 Singer (as agent for the Company), to pay to it (or as it may direct) in cleared funds an amount equal to the product of the Placing Price and the number of Placing Shares such Placee has agreed to acquire and the Company has agreed to allot and issue to that Placee. 7                 Irrespective of the time at which a Placee’s allocation(s) pursuant to the Placing is/are confirmed, settlement for all Placing Shares to be acquired pursuant to the Placing will be required to be made at the same time, on the basis explained below under „Registration and Settlement„. 8                 All obligations of N+1 Singer under the Placing will be subject to fulfilment of the conditions referred to below under „Conditions of the Placing” and to the Placing not being terminated on the basis referred to below under „Termination of the Placing”. 9                 By participating in the Placing, each Placee will agree that its rights and obligations in respect of the Placing will terminate only in the circumstances described below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by the Placee. 10              To the fullest extent permissible by law and applicable FCA rules, none of (a) N+1 Singer, (b) any of N+1 Singer’s affiliates, agents, directors, officers, consultants, (c) to the extent not contained within (a) or (b), any person connected with N+1 Singer as defined in the FSMA ((b) and (c) being together „affiliates” and individually an „affiliate” of N+1 Singer), (d) any person acting on N+1 Singer’s behalf, shall have any liability (including to the extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) to Placees or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise. In particular, neither N+1 Singer, nor any of its respective affiliates shall have any liability (including, to the extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) in respect of their conduct of the Placing or of such alternative method of effecting the Placing as N+1 Singer and the Company may agree.     Registration and Settlement If Placees are allocated any Placing Shares in the Placing they will be sent a form of confirmation by N+1 Singer, as soon as it is able which will confirm the number of Placing Shares allocated to them, the Placing Price and the aggregate amount owed by them to N+1 Singer. Each Placee will be deemed to agree that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed as directed by N+1 Singer in accordance with either the standing CREST or certificated settlement instructions which they have in place with N+1 Singer. Settlement of transactions in the Placing Shares (ISIN: GB00BGDW0L56) following Admission will take place within the CREST system, subject to certain exceptions. Settlement through CREST is expected to take place on 24 March 2017 unless otherwise notified by N+1 Singer and Admission is expected to occur no later than 8.00 a.m. on 24 March 2017 unless otherwise notified by N+1 Singer. Admission and Settlement may occur at an earlier date, which if achievable, will be notified through a Regulatory Information Service. Settlement will be on a delivery versus payment basis. However, in the event of any difficulties or delays in the admission of the Placing Shares to CREST or the use of CREST in relation to the Placing, the Company and N+1 Singer may agree that the Placing Shares should be issued in certificated form. N+1 Singer reserves the right to require settlement for the Placing Shares, and to deliver the Placing Shares to Placees, by such other means as they deem necessary if delivery or settlement to Placees is not practicable within the CREST system or would not be consistent with regulatory requirements in a Placee’s jurisdiction. Interest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with the arrangements set out above, in respect of either CREST or certificated deliveries, at the rate of 2 percentage points above prevailing LIBOR as determined by N+1 Singer. Each Placee is deemed to agree that if it does not comply with these obligations, N+1 Singer may sell any or all of their Placing Shares on their behalf and retain from the proceeds, for N+1 Singer’s own account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the amount owed by it and for any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with any interest or penalties) which may arise upon the sale of their Placing Shares on their behalf. If Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees must ensure that, upon receipt, the conditional form of confirmation is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation. Insofar as Placing Shares are registered in a Placee’s name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such Placing Shares should, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. Placees will not be entitled to receive any fee or commission in connection with the Placing, unless agreed otherwise agreed with N+1 Singer in its sole discretion.   Conditions of the Placing The Placing is conditional upon the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional and not having been terminated in accordance with its terms. The obligations of N+1 Singer under the Placing Agreement are, and the Placing is, conditional upon, inter alia: (a)             the fulfilment by the Company of its obligations under the Placing Agreement to the extent that the same fall to be performed prior to Admission; (b)             the Placing Agreement not having been terminated by N+1 Singer in accordance with its terms including, inter alia, for a breach of any of the warranties contained in the Placing Agreement prior to Admission; and (c)              Admission occurring by not later than 8.00 a.m. on 24 March 2017 (or such later date as the Company and N+1 Singer may agree in writing); (all conditions to the obligations of N+1 Singer included in the Placing Agreement being together, the „conditions„). If any of the conditions set out in the Placing Agreement are not fulfilled or waived in accordance with the Placing Agreement within the stated time periods (or such later time and/or date as the Company and N+1 Singer may agree, provided that the time for satisfaction of the condition set out in (b) above shall not be extended beyond 8.00 a.m. on 22 March 2017), or the Placing Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Placing will lapse and the Placee’s rights and obligations shall cease and terminate at such time and each Placee agrees that no claim can be made by or on behalf of the Placee (or any person on whose behalf the Placee is acting) in respect thereof. By participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations cease and terminate only in the circumstances described above and under „Termination of the Placing” below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by it. Some or all of the conditions may be waived in whole or in part by N+1 Singer, in its absolute discretion by notice in writing to the Company and N+1 Singer may also agree in writing with the Company to extend the time for satisfaction of any condition. Any such extension or waiver will not affect Placees’ commitments as set out in this Announcement. N+1 Singer may terminate the Placing Agreement in certain circumstances, details of which are set out below. Neither N+1 Singer, the Company nor any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers, employees shall have any liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in respect of any decision any of them may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time and/or date for the satisfaction of any condition to the Placing nor for any decision any of them may make as to the satisfaction of any condition or in respect of the Placing generally and by participating in the Placing each Placee agrees that any such decision is within the absolute discretion of N+1 Singer.   Termination of the Placing N+1 Singer may terminate the Placing Agreement, in accordance with its terms, at any time prior to Admission if, inter alia: 1                 there shall occur or come into effect any change in national or international financial, economic, fiscal, political or market conditions or changes in legislation which in the opinion of N+1 Singer (acting reasonably), is likely materially and adversely to affect the financial position or prospects of the Group taken as a whole or in the opinion of N+1 Singer is or will or is likely to be materially prejudicial to the Group or to the Placing or to the acquisition of the Placing Shares by the Placees; 2                 any statement contained in any Placing Document is or has become untrue, inaccurate or misleading in any material respect; or 3                 there has, in the opinion of N+1 Singer, occurred a material adverse change in the financial or trading position or prospects of the Group taken as a whole which in the opinion of N+1 Singer is or will or is likely to be materially prejudicial to the Company or to the Placing or to the acquisition of the Placing Shares by the Placees; or 4                 any matter has arisen which would, if any Placing Document were issued at that time, constitute a material omission therefrom of a material matter required to be included therein; or 5                 any of the warranties contained in the Placing Agreement are not true and accurate in any material respect or have become misleading in any material respect (or would not be true and accurate in any material respect or would be misleading in any material respect if they were repeated at any time up to Admission) by reference to the facts subsisting at the time when notice is given; or 6                 the Company has not complied or cannot comply in any material respect with its obligations under this Agreement, the Companies Act, FSMA, the FS Act, MAR or the AIM Rules; or 7                 N+1 Singer’s appointment as agent of the Company is terminated for any reason or any event has occurred such as to prevent or to a material extent restrict payment for the Shares in the manner contemplated by the Placing Agreement or this Announcement. If the Placing Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the rights and obligations of each Placee in respect of the Placing as described in this Announcement shall cease and terminate at such time and no claim can be made by any Placee in respect thereof. By participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees with the Company and N+1 Singer that the exercise by the Company or N+1 Singer of any right of termination, waiver of any condition or decision to extend (or not) the time for satisfaction of any condition, or any other right or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of the Company or N+1 Singer and that neither of the Company nor N+1 Singer need make any reference to such Placee and that neither N+1 Singer, the Company, nor any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability to such Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) whatsoever in connection with any such exercise. By participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees that its rights and obligations terminate only in the circumstances described above and under the „Conditions of the Placing” section above and will not be capable of rescission or termination by it after the issue by N+1 Singer of a form of confirmation confirming each Placee’s allocation and commitment in the Placing. Representations, warranties and further terms By participating in the Placing, each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee’s behalf) irrevocably represents, warrants, acknowledges, undertakes and agrees (for itself and for any such prospective Placee) that, in each case as a fundamental term of such Placee’s application for Placing Shares (save where N+1 Singer expressly acknowledges in writing to the contrary): 1                 it has read and understood this Announcement including these terms prior to the issuance of this Announcement through a Regulatory Information Service in their entirety and that its acquisition of the Placing Shares is subject to and based upon all the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, indemnities, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings and other information contained herein and that it has not relied on, and will not rely on, any information given or any representations, warranties or statements made at any time by any person in connection with Admission, the Placing, the Company, the Placing Shares or otherwise, other than the information contained in this Announcement and the Publicly Available Information;

Such agreement assumes that the Placing Shares are not being acquired in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to transfer the Placing Shares into a clearance service. If there are any such arrangements, or the settlement related to any other dealings in the Placing Shares, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax may be payable. In that event, the Placee agrees that it shall be responsible for such stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax and neither the Company nor N+1 Singer shall be responsible for such stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. If this is the case, each Placee should seek its own advice and they should notify N+1 Singer accordingly. In addition, Placees should note that they will be liable for any capital duty, stamp duty and all other stamp, issue, securities, transfer, registration, documentary or other duties or taxes (including any interest, fines or penalties relating thereto) payable outside the United Kingdom by them or any other person on the acquisition by them of any Placing Shares or the agreement by them to acquire any Placing Shares and each Placee, or the Placee’s nominee, in respect of whom (or in respect of the person for whom it is participating in the Placing as an agent or nominee) the allocation, allotment, issue or delivery of Placing Shares has given rise to such non-United Kingdom stamp, registration, documentary, transfer or similar taxes or duties undertakes to pay such taxes and duties, including any interest and penalties (if applicable), forthwith and to indemnify on an after-tax basis and to hold harmless the Company and N+1 Singer in the event that either the Company and/or N+1 Singer has incurred any such liability to such taxes or duties. The representations, warranties, acknowledgements and undertakings contained in this Appendix are given to N+1 Singer for itself and on behalf of the Company and are irrevocable. Each Placee and any person acting on behalf of the Placee acknowledges that N+1 Singer does not owe any fiduciary or other duties to any Placee in respect of any representations, warranties, undertakings, acknowledgements, agreements or indemnities in the Placing Agreement. Each Placee and any person acting on behalf of the Placee acknowledges and agrees that N+1 Singer may (at its absolute discretion) satisfy their obligations to procure Placees by itself agreeing to become a Placee in respect of some or all of the Placing Shares or by nominating any connected or associated person to do so. When a Placee or any person acting on behalf of the Placee is dealing with N+1 Singer, any money held in an account with N+1 Singer on behalf of the Placee and/or any person acting on behalf of the Placee will not be treated as client money within the meaning of the relevant rules and regulations of the FCA made under FSMA. Each Placee acknowledges that the money will not be subject to the protections conferred by the client money rules: as a consequence this money will not be segregated from N+1 Singer’s money (as applicable) in accordance with the client money rules and will be held by it under a banking relationship and not as trustee.

Google made the decision to remove the two context menu options years ago, according to the bug on the official Chromium site, but never got it done up until now. The company cites lack of use as the reason for removal. Additionally, the two context menu options add complexity too Chrome, and add additional scanning time "due to the menu length increase". Google removing Close other tabs, Close tabs to the right from Chrome Usage stats, which Google revealed in September 2016 highlight the relative usage of each context menu item of the browser: Duplicate: 23.21% Reload: 22.74% Pin / Unpin tab: 13.12% Close tab: 9.68% Reopen closed tab: 8.92% New tab: 6.63% Close tabs to the right: 6.06% Mute tab: 5.38% Close other tabs: 2.20% Unmute tab: 1.41% Bookmark all tabs: 0.64% Relative in this context means the percentage of all context menu actions by Chrome users. Close tabs to the right is listed there with 6.06% of all actions, and Close other tabs with 2.20% of all actions. This makes it a more popular action than mute tab, and less than 0.60% less popular than new tab. Chrome users have other means to spawn new tabs or close them which may explain the relatively low usage stats for those actions. Even close tab, and reopen closed tabs, are not too far away when it comes to relative usage of the actions. It appears that the removal has been assigned in February, and that Chromium and Chrome will see the removal of the two options in the near future. Side note: Google plans to remove the bookmark all tabs option as well from the browser. It is unclear however when this is going to happen, as no date has been given yet. Google notes that you still have an option to close multiple tabs. Simply hold down the Shift-key, click on all tabs that you want to remove, and use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-W to close the selected tabs. Now You: Are you affected by the change? It is interesting to note that Google thinks that these options are not used enough to keep them in Chrome Summary Article Name Google removing Close other tabs, Close tabs to the right from Chrome Description Google plans to remove the tab context menu items Close other tabs, and Close tabs to the right, from the company's Chrome web browser.

I'll definitely have to consider other options if Chrome loses more features considered advanced. Reply Heimen Stoffels March 21, 2017 at 10:24 am # Yeah. I mean: I'm not using Chrome (mostly Vivaldi, actually) but I don't see why they don't make these features optional then. They could put these features in Settings --> Advanced Settings --> (new) Context Menu section, or something similar to that, so that users can enable them if they really want to. Reply Hans Erbert March 20, 2017 at 8:15 pm # damn :( i have the same feeling as i had when firefox decided to go australis and also the same bad feeling when chrome switched from the 3d icon to the current ugly icon and no real alternative around :((( le. Duplicate: 23.21% -what? i hardly use it Reload: 22.74% - ok Pin / Unpin tab: 13.12% - i always pin gmail/facebook Close tab: 9.68% - i close with middle click Reopen closed tab: 8.92% - very usefull New tab: 6.63% - so low ? how people open new tabs?? Close tabs to the right: 6.06% - usefull sometimes Mute tab: 5.38% - what?? this is one of the important futures, but i use the icon is faster Close other tabs: 2.20% - i always use this at least 3-4 times a day after looking for something Unmute tab: 1.41% - using icon Bookmark all tabs: 0.64% - very usefull stuff, i always use it at the end of the day to save all "not read" stuff into a day folder :( no idea what i`ll do without it Reply Froyton March 20, 2017 at 8:45 pm # The "new tab" option has such a low usage because there's a dedicated button for that. It's the little parallelogram to the right of the last tab. Reply Froyton March 20, 2017 at 8:43 pm # I use both of those options periodically. Actually, I'm not sure I've ever used the tab context menu for anything else. I can live without them, but it will definitely be an annoyance for me. Reply D March 20, 2017 at 8:54 pm # I can't believe it! I use Close other tabs and Close tabs to the right many times a day. The only other context items I ever use are Duplicate and Reopen closed tab. Reply Yuliya March 20, 2017 at 8:56 pm # It's stuff like this that puts me off the most using Chromium. That's a very useful option to have. Especially close to the right. I don't like to browse like: a. search > open result > back > open next result > back > open next result > rinse and repeat for at least ten times I'd rather do: b. search > open all first ten results at once > check first, spawn a few more tabs maybe, check second, and so on Option b. is much faster and and better, helping me to eventually compare two or more smimilar, slightly different results. When I'm done, I want all those 30, 40 or whatever tabs closed, not clicking fourty times while holding shift, standing still in one foot, facing the North-West direction and tumbling twice -kind of nonsense to close some tabs. >the two context menu options add complexity And this is one of the most bs reasons they could come up with. What complexity? Is the removal of those options going to shave at least 20MB of Chrome's size? Because if it isn't then they're just a bucnh of liars. Last time I checked Chromium was a nearly 200MB monstrosity, meanwhile FireFox is less than 100MB, both x64 and Chromium without synch, rtc or any other of Google's nonsense. Reply asdsa March 20, 2017 at 9:16 pm # Yeah, I'm sure a few strings are making things so complicated for the devs. Lmao. It's a total bullshit reason. Hopefully someone will make an addon for bookmark all tabs -.- Reply Tau March 20, 2017 at 9:23 pm # How much time before Firefox follows? /s 6% seems pretty significant to me, given Chrome userbase. I'm always against removing this kind of features that don't have a performance impact whatsoever. If they are concerned about complexity (??), might as well develop a mode or something instead. Reply Ross Presser March 20, 2017 at 9:42 pm # angry react I use "close to right" at least a few times a week. Reply Earl March 20, 2017 at 9:43 pm # Man, yeah, I've really been hurtin' from those couple milliseconds wasted when scanning the context menu. (Google is about as smart as some stranger walking past your table in a restaurant and taking some food off your plate and then asking you, "Oh, were you gonna eat that?" [brilliant]) Reply Richard Allen March 20, 2017 at 9:55 pm # Personally, I think it's silly to remove those context menu items and use the excuse that usage is too low. Close tabs to the right: 6.06% of 1+ billion users is still kind of a big number. 60 million is not enough? That's like a whole country in western Europe. Sure, someone might develop an extension that replaces the menu but that in turn will raise memory usage, probably. Close tabs to the right and close other tabs is something that I use on a daily basis. Everyday I go through a few hundred articles with Feedly, open the ones I want to read in new background tabs, when I get a dozen or so then they are read, rinse, repeat. Google has a habit of removing features/services just to annoy me. ;) Another reason added to the list for why Chrome is not now nor ever will be my primary browser, not that Google cares, which is another item on the list. LOL Reply Martin Brinkmann March 20, 2017 at 9:57 pm # Richard, the stats are the relative usage based on 100% of the menu actions, not on Chrome user numbers. Reply Richard Allen March 21, 2017 at 10:25 am # Whoops! I see that now. Thanks for the clarification Martin. ;) Klemen March 20, 2017 at 10:07 pm # Huh, I've never used "Duplicate" before, but I do use "Close tabs to the right" daily. I expect a follow up post with "restore functionality" extension suggestions. Reply Clairvaux March 20, 2017 at 10:28 pm # I'm not a Chrome user, so I don't know how you close other tabs, or tabs to the right, without that context menu. Is there another available command which would be as convenient ? Is there an add-on for that ? I do know I would be furious if Google took that away from me. Yes, unreasonably long menus can be a nuisance, and slow down work, but that menu is not long by any measure. If this is long, people, you're making a browser for toddlers or retards. If you really have a problem with long menus (which you don't have here), make a simple mode and an expert mode, and let users chose. Closing other tabs, tabs on the right and, yes, tabs on the left are basic commands. Of course you need them. Maxthon had them ages ago. What do statistics have to do with that ? That's akin to looking up statistics in order to decide whether copy, cut and paste are useful enough, and maybe we could save a few bits from the planet by taking them off. Besides, the statistics do not conclude that people don't use those commands. If the figure for close tab is 9 % and the figure for close to the right is 6 %, it means that close to the right is an extremely useful command, used very often by very many people. How do I know ? Because close tab usage should be reajusted to 100 %. Everybody closes tabs at some point. Google people (among which are some of the most brilliant minds in the universe, we're told), seem to be saying : look, 9 % is really not very much, and frankly 6 % is very little, so this function is not useful. But the focus should be on the fact that close to the right is only used a third less than close tab, which seems to me very consistent with the intuitive perception. Of course people are doing a whole bunch of other things with their tabs, apart from closing them. If you compiled statistics on how often you launch Chrome in a day and how often you quit it, you'd probably find that you almost never use those functions : once a day for each would be close to the average, I would say. Of course you'd do a bunch of other things in between, so of course your launching and quitting statistics would be ridiculously low in comparison. Would that be a reason for taking away the possibility to launch and quit the program easily ? I don't think so. The minute you need to launch, quit, close other tabs or close to the right, then you need it very much, and in fact if you were deprived of that possibility, it would degrade significantly the overall quality of the program. Statistics are nice, however it's easy to use them stupidly. This is one more case of the spectacular dumbing down of things (and minds) that's going on in formerly developed countries. Reply Sojiro84 March 20, 2017 at 10:34 pm # Browser makers truy have gone insane. First Firefox is making itself a clone of Chrome by removing features. Now Chrome, which already lacked options, is removing features that are extremely handy! Yeah, 99% are casuals users who only knows that a computer goes on because they press a button and the "internet" is the icon in the taskbar but this is retarded. I already use Vivaldi 99% of the time and when they have sync implemented I can switch over fully. Vivaldi is the last true browser with features and options! Reply Teddy March 20, 2017 at 11:06 pm # The developers of Chrome keep making stupid decisions. Glad they are alternatives like Opera and Cent Browser. Reply ShintoPlasm March 20, 2017 at 11:09 pm # Next step for Chrome: remove tabs altogether. Then the buttons. Then leave the browser with a blank background and a huge Google search bar in the middle taking up the entire screen. Who needs bookmarks anyway? Reply Jozsef March 21, 2017 at 1:15 pm # This is where I see it going, followed closely by Firefox because Chrome lovers are all waiting for Firefox to become just as ugly and miserable to use so they can switch to it. It's perfectly logical. To the insane. But seriously, who would ever want to close or bookmark tabs, right? :P Reply RG March 20, 2017 at 11:13 pm # To be replaced by Uninstall Chrome? Reply Herman March 20, 2017 at 11:20 pm # As usual, when will companies come to the brilliant conclusion that not everyone is the lowest common denominator? What is so difficult about letting the user decide what features they want and when they want to use them? All that will happen is, is that some will leave and use a secondary browser, others will simply deal with it and move on while still others will either develop or use third-party addons to compensate for the feature that to them, was useful or desirable. Am I missing some secret of business? Why does this happen time and time again? If a company has a vision of how its software is supposed to look, why can't it come to the realization that many and in the case of something like windows 8, may strongly disagree with it? I'm sure it boils down to money, revenue, and the desire to dominate the market. Seems to me that if a software developer, developed a basic and advanced version of the same program they'd have far less complaints or at worst the same amount by way of a basic users being "tricked" into using the more advanced version. Doesn't seem like it would cost much more to do this since it would simply be a matter of hiding or unhiding features already there. Reply Swanny March 21, 2017 at 12:45 am # This sucks. I use Close tabs to the right frequently. I'm a user that hates tab clutter, I will generally open up multiple tabs from search results, and if I find one that's useful, I'll close the ones off to the right as they are no longer needed. Granted I can middle click to close tabs, but it was a nice quick solution. Reply hahaha March 21, 2017 at 2:17 am # I ALWAYS use Close other tabs + Close tabs to the right !! WTF..!!!!

Reply Lindsay March 21, 2017 at 10:53 am # The only times I've ever hit "close other tabs" or "close all but this" or whatever in a piece of software, it's been an accident. Good riddance! Reply BLACKSEALV March 21, 2017 at 11:52 am # I too would consider another browser as I use the close tabs functions every day. I have to open a lot of pages for my work. If I have to click on each tab it is both combersome and time consuming. No thanks Reply Sean March 21, 2017 at 12:51 pm # It affects me too. Are they going insane? I use these options always. Reply chesscanoe March 21, 2017 at 1:03 pm # I don't want to memorize another shortcut to get function I previously had with a simple click.

Reply Guest703 March 22, 2017 at 12:23 pm # As a Firefox user who may have to one day move to Chrome, I consider this a good move, along with Chrome's throttling of background tabs. Currently I have over 200 tabs open in Firefox, and "close all tabs to the right" is synonymous with Data Loss - a big no-no. Good move, Chrome. If people really need this functionality, I'm sure it can be re-added with an addon. Reply ShintoPlasm March 23, 2017 at 10:15 am # Does this mean this will be removed from Chromium itself, or just from the Chrome builds which Google creates from the Chromium milestones?

AI Can Now Identify Racist Code Words on Social Media Checkmate. Racists are locked in a linguistic arms race with software designed to trawl the web and pick out hateful keywords. When Alphabet imprint Jigsaw released an algorithm last year to pick out known slurs and other hateful messages online, racists responded with a campaign that replaced racial epithets with the names of Google products. During Operation Google, as it was dubbed, Jews became "skypes," and black folk became "googles." By replacing slurs with the company's own product names, they thought they'd outsmarted the software. Now, researchers at the University of Rochester have developed an algorithm that can identify hateful tweets using these same codes. In practice, this means that it can tell a tweet saying something like "gas the skypes" is hateful—whereas "I hate Skype" isn't—with roughly 80 percent accuracy. The researchers also hope that this algorithm could, with some work, track the evolving set of codes that racists use to harass people online. The trick, according to a paper that will be presented in May at the International Conference on Web and Social Media in Montreal, is to use AI to "learn" all the words that tend to go along with these hateful codes. For example, "#MAGA," "gas," or "white." Read More: Inside Wikipedia's Attempt to Use Artificial Intelligence to Combat Harassment "We essentially gathered hateful tweets and used language processing to find the other terms that were associated with such messages," Jiebo Luo, a professor of computer science and co-author of the paper, told me in an interview. "We learned these terms and used them as the bridge to new terms—as long as we have those words, we have a link to anything they can come up with. That's the key." This defeats attempts to conceal racist slurs using codes by targeting the language that makes up the cultural matrix from which the hate emerges, instead of just seeking out keywords. Even if the specific slurs used by racists change in order to escape automated comment moderation, the other terms they use to identify themselves and their communities likely won't. This idea has potential, especially considering the state of AI for identifying hate speech today. For example, when you type something wildly hateful, such as "gas the jews," into Jigsaw's web app to test its AI, it's marked as 81 percent likely to be viewed as toxic. But if you type in "gas the skypes," Jigsaw's AI simply tells you it needs more data to evaluate the statement. Luo and his colleagues' algorithm, on the other hand, may have caught this coded hateful message. As for what comes next, Luo said the team will be working on making the algorithm even more accurate, which will require a lot more Twitter data to continue to train the algorithm. "Our goal is to use data science for social good, so we certainly hope that companies like Facebook and Twitter can pick up our research," Luo said.

In the most recent beta version of the Android app Google added an upgrade to the parking feature. Currently on all mobile versions of Maps, there is a “Save parking location” setting available in the app. But the new feature adds more helpful information, according to The Verge. Read: Apple Releases New iOS 10.3 Beta Ahead Of Last Major iOS 10 Update The beta version offers manual parking reminders. Users can drop a pin where they park their car, by clicking the blue dot that represents them on the map, they can then access a page where parking information can be saved. On that page users can add photos, write notes and set a parking timer for spots that are metered or timed.   Apple Maps does this automatically for users so Google may be trying to catch up. Google does however have a feature in Google Now that will use the sensors in users phones  to determine when users seem to be traveling in a vehicle or start moving as though they have gotten out of a vehicle and are traveling by foot. It’s only available in beta on Android right now but should soon become available and then expand to iOS devices.

Matt Brittin, head of the firm’s European arm, said the company must “take responsibility” for the issue. It came as high street chain Marks & Spencer joined a raft firms to pull their advertising from YouTube. HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, McDonald’s, L’Oreal, Audi, the Royal Mail and the BBC have already suspended their advertising. It follows the discovery that adverts for households names have been appearing alongside content for supporters of extremist groups, including neo-Nazis, on YouTube. Read More MPs accuse Google of 'profiting from hatred' after taxpayer-funded ads appeared next to extremist YouTube videos A raft of big firms have pulled their advertising (Photo: Youtube) Companies have been inadvertently funding these groups as YouTube pays £6.15 of advertising revenue for every 1,000 views to those who post videos. Mr Brittin told the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London: “I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content.” But Yvette Cooper , chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Google’s apology “doesn’t go far enough”. The Labour MP said the company still had questions to answer over the incident. “They are right to apologise for failing to stop extremists making profits from hatred, and for making profits themselves from advertising on these videos,” she said. Yvette Cooper says the apology doesn't go far enough (Photo: Daily Mirror) “They need to say whether they will be paying back any of that advertising revenue. “And to answer our questions on what more they are doing to root out extremism or illegal activity on YouTube. Because they are still failing to do enough to remove illegal or hate filled content from YouTube.” Google’s advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts onto videos posted to YouTube as well onto pages of other websites. The Cabinet Office has confirmed it has temporarily suspended advertising with Google as a result of the issue. Google admitted last week that in “a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetisation policies” and that it “must do more” to improve its system, which it says is now under review. However Ms Cooper said more action was still required. “They still don’t seem to have woken up to the seriousness and toxicity of some of the videos they are still hosting and their own responsibility to deal with that,” she said. “It isn’t enough for Google to respond only when their advertising revenues take a hit. “They are one of the biggest and most powerful companies on the planet. “They can afford to do far more, far faster to deal with illegal and hate filled content online.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Politics newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On YouTube Google Politics News all Most Read Most Recent London terror attackBBC News presenter makes insensitive blunder during London terror attack report The BBC were reporting on the shootings outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster yesterday London terror attackLondon terror attack: Live updates as ISIS claims British-born suspect known to MI5 was "soldier of the caliphate" Four people, including hero police officer Keith Palmer, are dead after the attack in central London London terror attackMum killed in London terror attack as she picked up her kids from school Aysha Frade died on Westminster Bridge as she went to pick up her children aged eight and 11 from school, according to reports London terror attackWho is the London terrorist?

Earlier this year it added a parking availability feature that let you know how hard it would be to find a spot at your destination, but the latest addition to the Maps beta is one we’ve been waiting years for. Google has long offered a parking reminder card in Google Now, but it’s always been kind of flaky (and never really belonged there). With the latest Maps beta, Google is giving it a new home. First spotted by Android Police, when you tap the blue location dot on the map you’ll see a new Save your parking option, which will let you chart your position right inside Maps. Once you tap it, Google Maps will automatically save your current location inside Maps and add a reminder to your notification pane. However, while the location it sets will usually be good enough, you can also jot down some landmarks in a note field on the same screen as well as add a photo. There's also a timer alert for metered or zoned parking, as well as an ability to share your information, which will send the address, notes, and a link to the location in Maps. The beta also includes a new weather indicator for transit directions and an updated arrival screen for Android Auto users. Additionally, Android Police found a reference to a new sorting tool for searches when conducting its customary teardown. You can sign up to be a Maps beta tester in the Play Store or you can side-load the Google-signed APK from APKMirror. The impact on you on the road: This is one of the most overdue features in Google Maps, so much so that even Apple has had it in its far inferior Maps app for w while. We don’t know why it took Google so long to add it, but we just hope the beta testing is quick. To comment on this article and other Greenbot content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Over the last two days, there has been talk on how the initiative has finally reached Zimbabwe. In light of this, I thought it important for me to just give you simple reasons (that you might have just overlooked) on why you should actually participate. 1. It’s free Well, I know that might sound silly but free doesn’t really mean much to Zimbos when it comes to tech related workshops (my observation at least and please feel free to prove me wrong). Unless of course there is free food and/or refreshments. Nonetheless, I personally feel like free things should really be taken advantage of. I guarantee you that the next time you want to learn this very content Google is offering, it will not be for free! Or maybe you-yourself will teach the content you acquired for free someday at a cost – it’s called business. 2. No qualification prerequisite Maybe some of you are familiar with the hassle of applying for a vacancy and the struggle of trying to make your qualifications sound like a cut above the rest. If you know what I’m talking about, then you know exactly why I put this as a reason to attend. Google, (as we know it) is offering digital skill courses and you do not need any qualifications to partake! Therefore, there is no restriction, any ambitious entrepreneur can benefit from this, regardless of educational background (which is not always a fitting criteria to use for most of us, but story for another day!). advertisement 3. Lessons applicable to any line of business The general perception is that only tech related businesses should participate, but that’s entirely misleading. Google acknowledges that the world is fast digitising, therefore, to remain relevant in any field, there is need for businesses and individuals to learn these skills and keep up. Luke Mckend, the Google SA country director testifies on how local businesses have been helped since the offered tools and technologies are basic enablers that can be applied to literally any line of business. In fact, this is an opportunity for individuals to leverage the internet in order to give their businesses an online presence which is much more robust than the traditional way of doing business. 4. Person to person training In as much as the content being learnt is being made available online (for now that is) g.co/digitalskills ,if there is a chance to actually meet face to face with the teacher, why not? Maybe I am still backward for being biased towards learning in the old fashioned classroom way, but I would take that over online any day only if it’s an available alternative. However, this point is mostly relevant to those who actually need the digital skills first to then know how to access online material. So this might not be relevant to you directly, but I’m pretty sure you know someone who suits this criteria perfectly and would really appreciate you telling him/her about it.   5. Certificate of attendance Who doesn’t want those? Considering how much of a tech giant Google is, a mere certificate of attendance will go a long way in authenticating your career/ cause.   Image credit: digitalskills.withgoogle.com share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Digital Skills Training, Google Previous Post « Introducing Deals Friday Next post Friday Deal: Bluetooth remote controlled selfie stick by Amplify » 19 Comments Anonymous says: March 17, 2017 at 6:46 AM Hi Where can we register and were is the training?The link in your last article was broken.Acomment on this was made but its still broken.

This feature now appears to be live and widely rolling out to users. Recent is accessible from the navigation drawer of the Google app as the first entry. On first launch, users are greeted with a tutorial that can be accessed in the future from the overflow menu. This feature is aimed at helping “Rediscover topics you looked for in the Google app recently.” The interface makes heavy use of card stacks to group together related searches and gestures like pinching and swiping. Tapping or pinching on a stack will present large screenshots that can be viewed side-by-side. Stacks will show screenshots of websites you have clicked through, as well as different search tabs of the Google app that you’ve visited as part of a search. Tapping on any card will directly open that site or part of the Google app. Stacks and cards are arranged chronologically with a timeline present in every interface. Individual entries can be removed with a simple swipe up gesture. This just deletes the card and not the search from your browsing history. Notably, this section is device specific and does not sync across signed in devices. Additionally, this feature can be entirely disabled by going to Settings > Account & privacy > Enable Recent. Overall, this is a useful addition that is much simpler and more user-friendly than sifting through Chrome’s history list or taking constant screenshots to remember past searches. Recent is live on both the stable and beta version of the Google app. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

The Assistant-infused home hubs tend to cost $129 each, but if you buy 2 your price tag will show $229. That’s a $29 discount. It may seem costly to buy multiple units of these things, but it’s the only way to have Google Assistant present in multiple areas of your home. While some may call worth on that, we’d advise more budget conscious folks to wait for third-party devices like NVIDIA’s Spot for multi-room loving. At $49 per pop, it’s much more affordable (though likely won’t sport the same quality of speakers as a Google Home unit due to its size). Anyway, if Google Home is what you want and this sounds like a deal you want to take advantage of then be sure to find it right here. local_offer    Google   Google Home   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (2) stars Further Reading Android O Developer Preview arrives Shortcuts come to Google Search Google Assistant adds sports jokes Funny video shows frustrations with Google Home People are pissed off that Google Home is now delivering ads stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertFunny video shows frustrations with Google Home closeThis video perfectly shows why you shouldn’t waste your money on Google Home Google Home has been out for a little over 6 months now, but it seems the product is still a bit half-baked.

Simple coding may not be enough to make you an AI expert, but it can certainly help you do your own job better Subscribe to our newsletter. Siddharth Pai One can see the need to be able to write code in almost any profession. Photo: Hindustan Times Workers in the information technology (IT) industry worry about the decline in computer programming jobs due to the rise of automation and artificial intelligence (AI). Many former stalwarts are predicting doom for the industry. One of them has claimed that up to 200 million Indians will become jobless over the next decade. Consulting firm McKinsey and Co. makes a prediction that is even more dire, and which encompasses more than just the computer programming profession. It says that 51% of today’s jobs can already be made obsolete—not by technology that is over the horizon, but by technology that is available today, thereby saving the world’s capitalists almost $15 trillion in wages. As an aside, I can see almost every CEO begin to salivate. This is an opportune moment for consultants to birth a new buzzword, since Six Sigma, Transformation and Digital Disruption are all passé. I am going to christen it Technology Efficiency Engineering (TEE). Long may TEE live, and line the consulting fraternity’s pockets. Some governments such as Finland’s are already experimenting with macroeconomic moves such as establishing a universal basic income (UBI), which is a flat dole paid out to every citizen, in the expectation that automation will make the population jobless. Others, like former US president Barack Obama, are stressing the need for retraining millions of workers. Robert Reich, former US secretary of labour, suggested in a recent speech at Google’s offices that people should find fulfilment outside of work instead, since the level of unemployment will soar while median incomes stagnate or decline due to technology. This prediction of the “end of work” is difficult to swallow when one concurrently hears that the world economy is healthy; last week’s The Economist says the global economy is experiencing a “surprising” upturn, despite the rise of economic nationalism. Moreover, the IT industry is also expected to grow at speed over the next few years—some estimates place the growth at over 12% compounded annually. Where, then, is the disconnect? Reich provided a part of the answer, when after plugging UBI, he went on to say that the reduction in median incomes in the counties that overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump was caused not by “globalization” but by the inexorable rise of technology, and its almost insidious spread into every field of human endeavour. So, the inescapable fact is that computer programming is not going to go away any time soon; all that is going to happen is that the need to program a computer is going to become a mainstream part of any worker’s job, whether blue collar or white, much like familiarity with basic word processing or spreadsheets is today indispensable to many. Computer programming requires different skills than today’s blue-collar work, which often lies at the intersection of man and “unintelligent” machine. Interestingly, it also requires different skills than those needed for top-drawer jobs, which one pursues only after a long, strenuous period of education and apprenticeship—such as advanced biological science or medicine. According to Wired, many employers are responding to the needs of the evolving job market by attempting to make it more accessible for their employees to learn to code. Google, where Reich delivered his speech, has initiatives designed to engage and teach programming to anyone who may be interested. Schools the world over have been working to introduce coding early during a child’s schooling. We have seen institutions in India such as NIIT offer intensive programming courses to aspiring professionals. Fifteen years ago, NIIT’s headquarters outside Delhi even had computer consoles placed in cubbyholes on its perimeter walls, so that the indigent children playing in the fields outside its facility could familiarize themselves with the machines. The hope of that generation was that a decent level of education in coding would be enough to qualify NIIT’s students for a reliable job in the IT sector. Evidently, this may now be better focused on the population at large. Once coding is demystified and people realize that it is but a simple, learnable skill of the expression of logical commands, coding has the potential to open more doors to employment in the age of automation. Simple coding may not be enough to make you an AI expert, but it can certainly help you do your own job better. Wired cites the example of an Indian origin postdoctoral researcher in biology who has realized that she needs to code to run her laboratory. She had reams of data that came out of her lab experiments but found it limiting that she needed to go to someone with coding skills each time she needed to array and make sense of the data. The lady has now enrolled in an introductory programming class so that she can now do her job without being limited by her lack of ability to massage and manipulate her lab data as needed, since, as she says, she can’t manually look through 15,000 datapoints any longer. The US National Institutes of Health has also caught on, reportedly, and has been pushing to add coding skills to biomedical postgraduate training, since apart from specialized computational biology and bioinformatics programmes, most other fields of biology research don’t require coding classes. Meanwhile, working scientists who need to know this skill now turn to other means. One can see the need to be able to write code in almost any profession. McKinsey’s analysis has looked at the intersection of certain routine tasks such as real-time optimization or the discovery of new trends—with various industry sectors such as healthcare and telecom (think triage in a hospital emergency room or self-healing telecom networks) in an attempt to lay out areas where the potential of machine learning can have great impact. TEE, anyone? I’m off to the nearest academy to brush up my coding skills. And to TEE up a client!

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search SlashGear’s Birthday Gift Ideas Guide [Late Winter 2017] Chris Burns - Mar 20, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Here in the the gadget universe where men’s gift ideas and women’s gift ideas are equally awesome, SlashGear’s latest look at the landscape is key. What we’re doing today is running down a few of the most awesome items out in the wild available for grabbing for your favorite boy or girl. Be it your anniversary gift for a geek-like significant other or a birthday gift for a friend, we’ve got you covered in a radical way. Nobody is going to expect what’s coming from you if it comes from this list – and nobody’s going to be disappointed by that, either. The following gifts are presented by SlashGear in no particular order. While some items are available at only one store or another, some are available through multiple stores. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to the best prices – and don’t forget to patronize your favorite local stores, too. Unless you love the internet so much you don’t even give a hoot – welcome and glad you’re here! 1. PokeBall Heart Coin Bag From the top notch kawaii minds at Loungefly is this PokeBall made minipurse. Inside we’re able to fit a couple handfulls of bottlecaps or all the change we’d ever care to carry. Craftsmanship on this carry-friendly accessory is of the highest quality. This PokeBall Heart Coin Bag will cost a cool $20 from ThinkGeek right this minute. Search “Loungefly ThinkGeek Pokemon” for results. 2. Google Daydream View NOTE before you go any further that there are only a few devices that this VR headset works with thus far – sort of. You can use it with basically any smartphone in the world so long as you do not want to tap the screen – onscreen look-and-wait controls are best anyway, after all. But if you want the full experience, you’re going to need a Pixel or Pixel XL. See our Google Daydream View Review for more information on why this headset is neato. If your gift recipient has a Google Pixel or Google Pixel XL, this is the raddest thing you can get for them right this minute. This headset is beyond comfortable and enables a universe of possibilities in VR – all the software and such is already included on the Pixel. The Google Daydream View is available from Google through Amazon right now for $79 USD – or straight through the Google Store. 3. Eddard Stark Mobile Case While this case is called the Eddard Stark mobile case, you know good and well it’s the Hand of the King. Don’t expect the hand to come off – it’s not a pin – unless you force it to be. I’ve not yet had the courage to force this symbol off the case, I like it where it is for now, better. For a pin, you might want to look elsewhere (search for “Dark Horse Deluxe hand of king pin”) for less than a fiver. The only place you’re going to find this case – or the iPad case it’s closely related to – is on ThinkGeek’s accessory store. This is an exclusive creation and it’ll cost a cool $12.49 (or $25 for the iPad case). Search for “ThinkGeek Eddard Stark Mobile Case” to find it. 4. Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller This is another gift that requires that the gift-getter has a device already in-hand. The Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller requires an Xbox One to work – sort of. It also works with any Windows 10 PC – but I recommend it only be given to gift-getters that play lots of games. Gamers, that is to say – they’ll appreciate this one the most. For gift recipients that have an Xbox One and play it often, this is the ultimate gift. The Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller is the best Xbox One controller on the market, bar none. The Xbox One Elite Wireless Controller can be found in any Microsoft store or through the Microsoft store on Amazon for $148 USD. Have a peek at a few other controllers if this one is a bit too much to handle. 5. Marvel’s Spider-Gwen Convertible Headwear This is one of those particularly strange pieces of odd gift that’ll certainly throw your gift-getter for a loop. Even if they have no idea who Spider-Gwen is, the Spider-Man universe is more than welcoming for the average enjoyer of the branding. This piece of clothing is exclusive to ThinkGeek and comes in the Hats and Hair section for $20 – unless it’s on discount, which puts it down to a paltry $12! Search for “ThinkGeek Spider-Gwen Convertible Headwear” to find it. 6. Giant Microbes Heart Warming Box While we’d originally envisioned this gift as a Valentine’s Day key item, it really does work for any occasion. This is a collection of microbes in stuffed form, all stuffed into a heart box. Inside is contained one each of the following: Kissing Disease, Amoeba, Penicillin, Sperm, and an Egg. These stuffed oddities are available in several different sets – and with different microbes – but this one costs $30 from the Plush section at ThinkGeek. Search for “ThinkGeek Microbes” to seek it out. 7. Plush Han Solo in Carbonite and Darth Vader and Stormtroopers too This item is really one you’re going to have to consider if you’ve purchased any of the other Plush Star Wars sets from ThinkGeek in the past. Especially the Bounty Hunters set we featured in one of our recent run-downs of odd gifts. This is Han Solo in a block of Carbonite – perfect for those with plush collections or very, very small heads. This toy-like item costs $12 from from Toys & Games at ThinkGeek. Search for “ThinkGeek Plush Han Carbonite” to find this one. Next, this is the last plush entry on this list, I swear it! To be fair, everyone likes receiving a stuffed animal or two now and again. For the Star Wars fan who has everything – including the other Star Wars plus bouquets out there in the wild – this one is real nice for making a warm welcome for the Emperor. Of course there is no plush emperor in this collection – yet. This bouquet costs $50 on sale from $60 over at ThinkGeek, too. Don’t forget to throw away those sticks when you’re done being shocked getting this gift for your birthday, by the way – they’ll poke your eye out! Search for “ThinkGeek Bouquet” to find it – and others like it. 8. Withings / Nokia Thermo (smart thermometer) While we’ve got our fair share of oddities on this list, the Withings Thermo smart thermometer has to be the outlier. This is not a gift for tiny baby children. This is a gift for a parent. This is a thermometer that reads temperatures of a human being through their forehead. I personally use this device on myself and my own children all the time. It’s a completely different – better – experience from every thermometer that’s come before. No more putting a stick under an arm, no more putting a device under a toddler’s tongue – not that you’d have been able to do that anyway. This device is also far more consistently accurate than any thermometer I’ve used before. Of note is the branding on this device. I reviewed and use the Withings Thermo last year, while Nokia has since acquired the Withings brand. Nokia is in the process of rebranding every Withings device – including this one – so don’t be surprised to find this same device with a Nokia brand on it in the near future. This device can be found on Amazon in the Withings store for around $100 USD. Wrap-up As it has been in the past, so too is it true today with every gift guide I’ve ever written for SlashGear: this gift guide is good for everyone. It is not meant for just men or just women, and not just people that consider themselves a nerd, geek, or gadget-inclined. If you’ve not found what you’re looking for here, have a peek at the rest of our Gift Guide portal for more ideas. We’ve got lots and lots and lots!

STEPHEN, S.C. — For eighth-grader Lakaysha Governor, her daily two-hour school bus commute had been spent catching up with friends and trying to tune out distractions from unruly preschoolers. Now, thanks to Google, the aspiring forensic anthropologist said she's able to spend that time finishing up her daily school work so she's free to engage in her favorite activity once she gets home: reading. Lakaysha is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina's rural Berkeley County benefiting from a grant from Google, which on Monday unveiled one of its 28 WiFi-equipped school buses in the area. The tech giant has also given the school district 1,700 Chromebooks, the stripped-down laptops on which public schoolchildren do their class and homework as school books largely are replaced by online worksheets and articles. Some students like Lakaysha in this sprawling, rural district about 50 miles north of Charleston spend a total of two hours riding the bus to and from school each day. With much of students' homework now online-only, that's time lost in terms of trying to prepare for the next day. The grant, Google's first of a kind in South Carolina, is no accident. Google has at least a decade-long relationship with Berkeley County, where it's invested more than $1 billion in data center complexes in Berkeley County since 2007, bringing more than 100 jobs. Google says it also has awarded nearly $2 billion in grants to local schools and nonprofits. Google hopes to expand the Wi-Fi program into other rural areas across the country, including other areas where it already has data centers, which process search queries and other information, according to Lilyn Hester, a Google spokeswoman based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The first such effort was launched last year in Caldwell County, North Carolina, where a data center already exists. The expansions are also needs-based, Hester said, and Google is focusing on rural places where broadband internet access has been slow to spread. "Why don't we make that instructional time?" Hester said of officials mused about the time many students spend on school buses. Google is already looking for ways to make the high-tech buses useful outside of school hours, working with the school district and community on places the buses can go once the school day is done to bring connectivity elsewhere, such as a community center or fellowship hall. Lakaysha, the eight-grader who has her eye on Harvard, has internet access at home like most of her friends. But thanks to the WiFi buses, she can get ahead on her work. Teachers are happy, she said, because "more students are doing their homework." And those rambunctious preschoolers are even quieter in the mornings, too. "Now that we have the Chromebooks and the WiFi, they're kind of quiet; so it's good for everybody."

(AP Photo/Meg Kinnard) ST. STEPHEN, S.C. (AP) — Eighth-grader Lakaysha Governor spends two hours on the bus getting back and forth to school each day. Thanks to a grant from Google, she can now use that time more productively and get her homework done. The aspiring forensic anthropologist is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina’s rural Berkeley County who will ride to school on one of 28, Google-funded, Wi-Fi-equipped school buses unveiled Monday. The tech giant also has given the school district 1,700 Chromebooks, the stripped-down laptops on which many schoolchildren now do their class and homework. As more class assignments and homework migrate online, such long bus rides have generally counted as lost time in preparing for the next school day. But Google said it hopes to help expand the use of Wi-Fi on school buses in other rural areas elsewhere around the country. Google has at least a decade-long relationship with Berkeley County, where it’s invested more than $1 billion in data center complexes since 2007, bringing more than 100 jobs.

Teachers are happy, she said, because “more students are doing their homework.” And she said even rambunctious preschoolers aboard the bus are quieter in the mornings while older students are doing homework. “Now that we have the Chromebooks and the WiFi, they’re kind of quiet; so it’s good for everybody.” ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Solomon Google Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Google is under fire this week, as numerous high-profile European companies withdraw or threaten to withdraw from the search engine’s lucrative ad business over concerns that their promotions are being placed alongside extremist, racist content. Companies that have ditched Google, or might do so, include HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, British telecom giant Vodafone and the European subsidiary of McDonald’s. Meanwhile, British Parliament member Yvette Cooper has alleged that Google is “profiting from hate.” The ads earn Google, as well as the person or entity whose content they are placed next to, small amounts of money that can add up for very popular videos or articles. According to the Guardian, this arrangement could have landed extremists over $300,000 in revenue from unsuspecting corporations. Google uses a formula for ad placement that automatically slots promotions and content together. That has wound up in some cases putting spots from major brands next to David Duke’s hateful rants. The company’s execs are planning to liaise with companies about the issue at an upcoming annual conference for European marketers. Google has not said yet what it will do to allay advertisers’ concerns, though it has promised to review ad placement procedures, try to tweak its own programs to avoid mismatches between ads and content, and reach out to companies about the best ways to make use of ad technology.

A software engineer at Square understands our needs and dedicated himself to figuring out how to get the company’s cardless reader to activate through Google Home voice commands. The result is a Google Home that activates the Square Contactless Reader, which then accepts an Apple Pay transaction for the spoken amount. To get it to work, the engineer, Pierre-Yves Ricau, built a Rube Goldberg Machine of API calls, which perfectly illustrates the “open-ish” nature of the various devices and services he wired together. The resulting process calls IFTTT from Google Home with the voice command, which includes variables for how much money you want and what product is being purchased. Then IFTTT pings a custom cloud API, which pings a custom Android app, which pings Square’s Point of Sale software, which finally fires up the Contactless Reader. Simple! All the code’s on GitHub if you want to follow along at home. Ricau thinks his project might be useful for baristas who have their hands full with espresso and mugs. I think shouting, “Google, charge $2 for coffee,” over and over will probably get tiring for employees while simultaneously annoying everyone in the shop, but maybe that’s just me.

NEW DELHI: A report on the browsing history of Najeeb's laptop received by Delhi Police from Google and YouTube has revealed that in the months preceding his disappearance, Najeeb had been looking for information on Islamic State (IS) — ideology, executions and network. His Google searches included things like ways to join IS. Highly-placed sources claimed that most of the videos he watched on YouTube were also related to the Islamic State. These details, which have opened another line of investigations, have been submitted in the Delhi high court. Delhi Police has claimed that Najeeb was watching a video of the speech of an IS leader on the night of October 14, just before he had a scuffle with ABVP members when they knocked on his door. He went missing the next morning before being caught on CCTV boarding an autorickshaw. Desperate to get a breakthrough in the case, the cops are now also exploring - with the help of a counter-intelligence agency - the possibility of him getting radicalised and being lured away via Nepal. Posters with Najeeb's photograph have been put up in several areas of Nepal that are close to UP. The case has seen many twists and turns in the past four-and-a-half months. The first lead that cops pursued was when they found that he was on medication for obsessive compulsive disorder from 2012. He was prescribed Flunil (20mg) and Zolfresh (5mg) on August 27. The first is used to treat depression and OCD while the latter is used to induce sleep. On September 9, he was prescribed Lonazep that's used to treat fits, panic attacks and agoraphobia (fear of public places). Police also found Pari 10, an anti-depressant, and another medicine from Ahmed's room, said sources. The most curious twist came in mid-January when the family received a ransom call of Rs 20 lakh. The cops arrested the caller. It turned out that he was only trying to make some money. When Najeeb's email was accessed last week, they landed up at his house, tracking the IP address, and found his maternal uncle was using his account. The police have been visiting places that Najeeb had looked up online. One was Manipur but sleuths found that he had a classmate from there. The police have also been probing if Najeeb took shelter at some shrine as his mother said he was religious since childhood. Cops have visited over 150 mosques and madrasas in Agra, Badaun and other places in western UP, and Ajmer. In December, more than 600 Delhi Police personnel, assisted by sniffer dogs, had scanned the inhabited and forested areas of the sprawling JNU campus to search for clues. Najeeb's laptop was sent for forensic examination. A reward of Rs 10 lakh has been announced by the police for any information about him. Najeeb's mother, Fatima Nafees, has expressed dissatisfaction with the police's probe. The Delhi HC has also been pulling up the cops for being unable to track him down.

Shares  Even though it’s one of the largest electronics firms in the world, Samsung doesn’t have a storied history of leading the way in the phone world. I’m not talking about the innovative hardware it develops internally – the constantly-impressive Super AMOLED screens that adorn its top-end phones are testament to that ability – but rather its modest record when it comes to defining the ‘next chapter’ in mobile. So when I read that Samsung was developing its own AI assistant last year, one to rival Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa, it felt very much like a case of ‘me too’. Samsung saw what its competitors had, and wanted in. But now we know more about Bixby – and it’s going to have a very prominent place on the forthcoming Galaxy S8 in the shape of a dedicated Bixby key.  Samsung confirms the Galaxy S8 and reveals why it has a mystery button That’s the first dangerous move: in a world where high-end phones are homogenizing in terms of features, there’s going to be intense scrutiny from both tech watchers and the wider media as to whether Bixby is a game-changer, not the potential of such a platform – and if Samsung’s AI play isn’t amazing from the outset then the reception from the public is likely to be dismissive. So why is Samsung bothering at all? It must have a great reason, because Bixby feels rushed out right now. The South Korean brand only purchased Viv, the AI platform created by a few of the founders of Siri, in October last year, and Samsung doesn’t seem to be too bullish about what Bixby will be able to do at launch. In fact, all the launch language seems to be about the future: how Samsung ‘plans’ to have an SDK that third-party developers will be able to use; how Bixby will ‘gradually’ be integrated with other appliances like air conditioners and TVs. Even the example of how it will be used on the smartphone, clearly the primary focus for Bixby within Samsung (given it was the mobile division that bought Viv, and the focus on that segment throughout Bixby’s launch) was diluted: being able to make a call by pressing a button and speaking, rather than having to navigate through multiple menus. That doesn’t seem at all futuristic or helpful when I can literally do that with an iPhone or Google Assistant-enabled phone… and I don’t even need to press a button. Going head to head with Google That idea of Samsung playing a dangerous game comes to the fore again when you consider that Bixby will be in direct competition with Google Assistant. Google has already reportedly asked Samsung to delay its AI assistant to help promote its own offering on the Nougat-enabled Galaxy S8 – so either that report wasn’t true or Samsung has decided to defy the request. This seems reminiscent of a time a few years ago when Samsung was putting significant weight behind its own services: Samsung Music, Samsung Video and its own apps portal, along with a competitor OS to Android in the shape of Tizen, which threatened the dominance of Google’s platform. The worry was that so few people were aware that their phone was powered by Android that Samsung could just switch to its own Tizen platform, complete with an app and content store, and Google would lose its biggest customer. However, a truce was brokered between the two, and now we see phones clearly badged as ‘powered by Android’, Samsung’s services have been shuttered, and Tizen is limited to TVs and smartwatches. And that’s what Bixby looks like right now – a bargaining chip in the game of big-brand brinksmanship, one that will enable Samsung to strike a better deal during the next round of partnership negotiations. This idea explains a lot: why Samsung wants to get such a platform out there before it seems ready, testing it in the market rather than bringing it out fully-baked and landing on watches, TVs and fridges as well as adding functionality to multiple apps on the phone, both native and third-party. The Galaxy S8 - image credit @evleaks However, just because it’s perhaps early in its life cycle, that doesn’t mean Bixby will be a poor attempt at AI – Samsung has clearly been working on such a service for a long time before it bought Viv, and that platform has been dubbed an improvement on Siri, “the intelligent interface for everything.” According to research by performance-based marketing platform Fluent, 77% of consumers either don’t care which AI their phone is running care, whether that’s Apple’s Home, Google’s Home, Amazon’s Alexa or Samsung’s SmartThings – so eventually all of the brands making hardware in the internet of things space will have to sign up. Even if Samsung hasn’t become the main player in the AI assistant space – which is possible, given how far behind its competitors it is (unless it’s got something truly spectacular up its sleeve for Bixby) – its size means it’ll have something to offer a potential partner, rather than just having to kowtow to whatever the dominant platform provider wants. This could be good news for those who just want a decent phone, and don’t care about the machinations behind the scenes. Samsung will be forced to provide some attractive innovation on its AI platform, to offer something different to push machine-learning platforms forward. Let’s just hope Bixby sits quietly on the side of Galaxy S8, slowly gathering connections with other apps, rather than turning out to be a messy, conflicting AI nuisance that messes with Google Assistant.   Want to know more about the Samsung Galaxy S8?

The apology from Matt Brittin, president of Google's Europe, Middle East and Africa division, came after UK banks HSBC and RBS, along with major retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S), decided to suspend their adverts from appearing on platforms such as YouTube. "I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Brittin said in a statement. "We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously." Brittin said Google was already making improvements thanks to increased investment -- resulting in it "raising the bar for our ads policies, simplifying advertiser controls and adding safer defaults". In a statement today, HSBC said said it takes "breach of our digital advertising standards very seriously and have put advertising with Google on hold at this time". An M&S spokesman added: "In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through." The British arm of French advertising agency Havas suspended such advertising last week. Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, are the BBC, Guardian newspaper group and McDonalds UK. In the UK, a committee of MPs has meanwhile demanded that Google explain how government adverts have appeared on "inappropriate and hate-filled sites" and whether the government and advertisers will be refunded payments made to the US tech giant.

Photo : Steve Adams Copyright Archant Norfolk 2015 Marks & Spencer has pulled its adverts from Google following concerns that they were appearing alongside extremist content. Share Comment Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. The high street giant said it is “pausing activity across Google platforms”, which includes the video-sharing site YouTube. The move comes after the US tech firm was accused by MPs last week of “profiting from hatred” over its advertising system, which saw both company and taxpayer-funded adverts appear alongside extremist material. An M&S spokesman said: “In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through.” M&S joins the likes of HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, the BBC and McDonald’s in withdrawing its ads. The Cabinet Office said it has placed a temporary restriction on its YouTube advertising “pending reassurances from Google that Government messages can be delivered in a safe and appropriate way”, while the Guardian and Channel 4 have also halted their advertising with the firm. Google’s advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. The internet giant’s UK managing director, Ronan Harris, has admitted the company “can and must do more” to combat what it called “bad advertising”. “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. “With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise that we don’t always get it right. “In a very small percentage of cases, ads appear against content that violates our monetisation policies,” he said.

Search Watch Live Home UK Brexit Trump World Business Politics Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Google boss apology as more firms suspend ads over hate videos Matt Brittin apologises as well-known brands take action on concerns over extremist content appearing on YouTube. 19:38, UK, Monday 20 March 2017 Video: Go Ape and Hargreaves Lansdown have pulled their adverts from YouTube after Sky News alerted the companies to the fact that they were appearing ahead of videos posted by the English Defence League. Sky's Business Correspondent Adam Parsons reports. Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail By John-Paul Ford Rojas, Business Reporter The European boss of Google has apologised for online adverts appearing next to extremist material as big firms, including M&S, pull ads from the internet giant. Matt Brittin, head of the company for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said: "We are sorry to anybody that's been affected." He made the comments at an industry conference after a number of well-known UK brands suspended advertising over concerns centred on content appearing on Google's YouTube platform. M&S said: "In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through." Go Ape - the outdoors adventure firm - said it had suspended its advertising on YouTube after Sky News Business Correspondent Adam Parsons alerted the company to its ads being run alongside English Defence League videos. Image Caption: Go Ape does not want its brand mistakenly associated with the EDL The investment firm, Hargreaves Lansdown, also pulled its ads for the same reason. Even the Government has done the same while global advertising giant Havas, which buys ad space for a number of big companies, suspended advertising last week. :: What the firms are saying Other big names to take similar action include McDonald's UK, Tesco and Sainsbury's, Audi UK, and L'Oreal in the UK and Ireland, plus high street banks Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Lloyds. Meanwhile, some businesses, including Barclays, are considering what to do - though Barclays does not currently have any advertising on YouTube or Google. Video: Google under pressure from advertisers over extremist material Sky, the owner of Sky News, said: "It is clearly unacceptable for ads to be appearing alongside inappropriate content and we are talking with Google to understand what they are doing to stop this." Mr Brittin said Google already spent millions of dollars and employed thousands of people to try to ensure "bad advertising doesn't get through" and that this worked well "in the vast majority of cases". But he acknowledged it could improve and said a review which had been going on "for some time" was being accelerated. Video: The chief executive of advertising giant WPP, Sir Martin Sorrell, says while Google is taking action to address client outrage over ads beside extremist content, the company could yet face claims for compensation. He said Google was looking at better defining hate speech and inflammatory content, simplifying controls available to advertisers, and going further and faster in its efforts to remove "bad content" - in the context of 400 hours of content being uploaded to YouTube every minute. Last week, media-buying agency GroupM, part of the world's largest ad agency WPP, told Google to apologise to customers and advertisers who saw inappropriate content on YouTube. It has also written to clients explaining the potential risks to their brands and asking them how they want to respond. Video: Matt Brittin, Google president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, apologises over extremist content at an Advertising Week conference MPs recently said Google was "still profiting from hatred" after it failed to remove videos from groups allegedly linked to terrorism. Google was summoned to appear in front of Cabinet Office ministers on Friday. Sky News understands the company apologised to senior civil servants representing the Government and pledged a review of their advertising systems. Google was asked to return for another meeting this week to set out the action they plan to take. Yvette Cooper MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, has said Google's failure to remove the hate videos by was "frankly astonishing" Last week the committee summoned bosses from Google, Facebook and Twitter, to question them about the action the web giants were taking to remove hate speech from their platforms.

YouTube is promising more control over where ads appear, after brands were spooked by running near offensive videos. Credit: TARIK KIZILKAYA/iStock Most Popular Advertiser angst -- and an eagerly vigilant European media -- will put a squeeze on YouTube's ad sales potential over the coming months, according to a prominent analyst. Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group said that concerns over brand safety on YouTube, where ads were recently seen running alongside terrorist-inspired videos, would have a chilling effect on the site's revenue. "Alphabet's Google is facing a serious issue in the U.K. with brand safety issues, which has global repercussions," Mr. Wieser wrote in an investor note on Monday. "Although spending by advertisers who have announced their intention to suspend spending on YouTube and other Google properties is relatively small so far, we think that awareness of the incident will marginally curtail global growth this year versus prior expectations." Last week, Havas and a string of top brands indicated they would halt spending on YouTube ads in the U.K. until the video site could assure their spots wouldn't run near offensive content. Google, which owns YouTube, responded by saying it would take steps to better monitor content on the site and give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. "I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," said Matt Brittin, Google's EMEA president, who spoke at Advertising Week in Europe on Monday. "We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously." The issue of brand safety has become a top industry concern, especially since last year's election, when a proliferation of questionable websites sprung up to spread fake news. Related Stories Google Admits Brand Safety Is a Global Problem Havas Freezes All Google and YouTube Ad Spend in the U.K. YouTube Promises New Auditing Measures Will Prove Ad Quality Both Facebook and Google had to investigate how their online ad networks helped support such low-quality sites, and advertisers started applying more scrutiny to where their ads showed up. Last week, the Financial Times found ads from the U.K. government and others running with YouTube videos by U.S. white nationalist David Duke and an Egyptian terror advocate. That set off another round of advertisers scrambling to understand how and when their ads appear online. Mr. Wieser said that the focus on YouTube in Europe was particularly hard for the company, because traditional media there would be dogged in their reporting. "Making the problem potentially worse if it is not fully solved," Mr. Wieser wrote, "Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe (many of them owners of print properties which have been negatively impacted by Google's successes in recent years) and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings, negatively impacting brands." It will be tough to eradicate everything anyone might find offensive on the platform. Even YouTube's biggest star PewDiePie, Felix Kjellberg, was tarnished after joking about anti-Semitism. YouTube is launching a new TV cable bundle, where it might find it has more control over a more curated digital video experience. Also, it has been giving more power to users to report content they find offensive. However, it's not always easy to understand where the line is between free speech and censorship. "We think that Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero-tolerance policy to alleviate concerns before it can fully recover," Mr. Wieser wrote.

The high street firm said they are “pausing activity across Google platforms”, including YouTube. The move comes after Google were accused by MPs last week of “profiting from hatred” over their advertising system, which saw both company and taxpayer-funded adverts appear alongside extremist material. M&S said: “In order to ensure brand safety, we’re pausing activity across Google platforms while the matter is worked through.” M&S join the likes of HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, the BBC and McDonald’s in withdrawing their ads.

The Guardian newspaper and Channel 4 have also halted advertising with the firm. Google’s advertising network uses an automatic filtering system which places adverts on websites and videos. Google’s UK managing director Ronan Harris admitted the company “can and must do more” to combat “bad advertising”. He added: “We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls. We will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. “With millions of sites in our network and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, we recognise we don’t always get it right.” Read More Top news stories today Scotland on security alert Gangster justice 'a top priority' Sheriff slams 'smirking selfie' thugs Oasis guru Alan 'almost bought Hearts' Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @Daily_Record Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Google News all Most Read Most Recent Ayr NewsDead man lies in Wetherspoon pub toilet overnight - before being found by cleaner The dead man's body was found by a shocked cleaner who made the grizzly discovery in the giant pub.

The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic and anti-Semitic messages, prompting a flood of major companies to follow suit. Britain is the largest market for Alphabet Inc’s Google outside the United States, generating $7.8 billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly 9 percent of the U.S. giant’s global revenue.

CNET executive editor Sharon Profis joins CBSN wi... “I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content,” Google EMEA President Matt Brittin said at the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London. Besides well-known British brands pulling the plug, some of the world’s biggest advertising companies responsible for placing vast amounts of marketing material for clients, said they were reviewing how they worked with Google. The boycott is the latest clash between advertising companies and the internet giants that have built up dominant positions in digital advertising by offering not only huge audiences but also the ability to apply their user data to make ads more targeted and relevant. For big advertising groups such as WPP, internet firms are both a client and a competitor, while traditional media groups such as newspapers and general online news publishers are having to compete with them for online dollars. Hostile Industry “Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe ... and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings,” said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group. “Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem,” he said. WPP, the world’s largest advertising firm, said on Monday it was talking to clients and media partners such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished. “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements,” said Martin Sorrell, the founder and head of the British firm.

Publicis, the world’s third largest advertising firm, said in a statement on Monday that it was clear Google had fallen short of meeting advertising standards and that the French company was reviewing its relationship with Google. Google said on Friday it worked hard to remove ads appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute it did not always get it right. Brittin said Google had made a commitment to doing better and would simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investment to enforce its ad policies faster. A spokeswoman for Google UK said it would look again at the way it defines incendiary commentary and hate speech to raise the bar on videos and sites allowed for advertising. On Friday, Google executives were called in to face questions from the advertising industry and Britain over the issue. Representatives for retailers Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s and Argos, British banks HSBC and RBS, McDonald’s, the UK branch of advertising group Havas and the BBC told Reuters their firms had stopped ads. A source at Lloyds Banking said the lender had pulled the plug as well. Others such as Vodafone, Barclays and Tesco were reviewing policies, their representatives said.

I take the issue very seriously and I apologize in the instances where that may have happened,” Matt Brittin, Google’s president of Europe, Middle East and Africa business and operations, said at the Advertising Week Europe conference Monday in London, according to the Guardian. Brittin’s remarks come after a wave of U.K. advertisers have said they were pulling advertising from Google and YouTube over the issue. British retailer Marks & Spencer on Monday said it would discontinue advertising with with the internet company, coming after several other marketers and agencies said they would do the same. According to reports, those include the U.K. government, O2, McDonald’s, the BBC, L’Oréal, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, the Guardian, Audi, Channel 4 and Havas’ British unit. Internet companies and social media networks have long faced issues over advertising placed against objectionable content. But it’s grown into an loud chorus of protests in the U.K. over the last few days, after the Guardian reported that it had discovered some of its ads on YouTube had appeared with such content as videos by American white nationalists, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke; a hate preacher banned in the U.K.; and “a controversial Islamist preacher.” In his remarks Monday, Brittin said Google would review its policies for identifying inappropriate content and would strive to improve tools for advertisers to control how their ads are placed on YouTube. “We’ve made a public commitment to doing better and are making improvements in three areas: raising the bar for our ads policies; simplifying advertiser controls and adding safer defaults; and increasing investment in enforcement to act faster,” he said at the conference. But he also suggested some advertisers may be interested in running ads alongside controversial content, the Wall Street Journal reported. “We want to be thoughtful,” Brittin said.

Now, the site has taken action to ensure that its many bloggers aren’t caught up in the same kind of censorship punishment. Natural News has launched NaturalNewsBlogs.com, a standalone site that provides a free-speech platform for writers and bloggers who are interested in a variety of topics, including natural and alternative health, fitness, organic food, politics, science and technology, and  other topics of interest to a wide range of readers. “The site strongly criticizes drugs-and-surgery medicine, vaccines, corporate corruption, animal testing, the use of humans for medical experiments, the chemical contamination of foods, heavy metals in consumer products, factory farming and government corruption. If you want to write on a topic we don’t yet have in our system, we can add it,” says site creator, Mike Adams, the Health Ranger and founder of Natural News. (RELATED: See all the news that the mainstream media wants to hide from you at MediaFactWatch.com) The site receives a tremendous amount of publicity from the NaturalNews.com home page, as well as a daily email newsletter, posts on social media like Facebook, Share.NaturalNews.com, Google Plus and others. Posts are evaluated daily by the Natural News editorial staff, and the ones believed to be particularly valuable to the home site readers are featured in the daily newsletter, giving authors and bloggers additional exposure to hundreds of thousands of active readers. And while there are no special requirements or restrictions to the number of blogs you can post, there is a minimum word requirement of 350. Making NaturalNewsBlogs.com its own standalone site became necessary after Natural News was temporarily censored recently by Google. For several days, none of Natural News’ 140,000-plus stories were accessible through a standard Google search. The reason supplied was that a few blog posts contained forbidden advertising, though they were a few years old, and only found on the blogs subdomain, not the NaturalNews.com root domain. As Adams noted when Google restored Natural News to its search algorithm: For the record, there was never any allegation or evidence that Natural News had intentionally violated Google’s webmaster guidelines. While Google said we were being flagged for a so-called “sneaky mobile redirect” on a very small number of pages in a subdomain (blogs.naturalnews.com) which were created by outside bloggers, Google went to the extraordinary step of banning the entire NaturalNews.com root domain and all its subdomains — a step that would never have been applied to CNN, Huffington Post or other popular news websites. In fact, a Natural News investigation showed that violations identified involving websites like HuffPo, Forbes and CNN did not result in the same kind of blacklisting that was applied to Natural News.  Furthermore, while Google did make an effort to provide us with one URL that they said flagged this mobile redirect, to date there hasn’t been a single SEO expert or engineer who could reproduce the supposed redirect issue. In other words, the action seemed very arbitrary at the time, and still seems that way. (RELATED: Google censorship of Natural News: Statement from the Health Ranger) At about the same time, Info Wars noted that it had lost a major advertising revenue source, ostensibly because it is an independent media organization that is not afraid to report news that is outside the mainstream: AdRoll, the online advertiser that accused Breitbart of “hate speech,” is now abruptly cutting ties with Infowars.com in an apparent, concentrated effort to shut down political speech by conservatives and libertarians online. The cancellation came after the company sent Infowars’ legal department a vaguely-worded email stating it was ending its ad campaign, in part, because “all political content should focus on the merits of the candidate,” which was an implication corrupt political establishment candidates like former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton should be praised, while her various scandals should be glossed over or ignored outright. Because of these attempts at censorship, NaturalNewsBlogs.com has become its own entity to better serve our readers and provide our bloggers with an accessible platform not subject to arbitrary punishment by Alt-Left social media sites and advertisers.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah New Google tool shows you how much money you'll save by going solar By Herb ScribnerDeseret News@HerbScribner Published: March 20, 2017 11:05 a.m. Updated: March 20, 2017 11:10 a.m. 5 Comments View 2 Items Rocky Mountain Power The Rocky Mountain Power solar plant near Holden, Utah, provides solar energy for the utility company's Subscriber Solar Program, which is 95 percent sold out. The pilot project allows residential and business customers to purchase solar power in blocks, potentially cutting their monthly costs. Utahns considering whether or not to buy solar panels may want to visit Google for advice. Project Sunroof, a Google map that shows which houses in any given area have enough exposure to sunlight for solar panels, recently expanded to cover all 50 U.S. states, allowing people all over the country to see whether their home is fit for solar panel installation, according to Mashable. The map identifies which area of the home attracts the most sunlight while accounting for weather patterns, shade and the position of the sun, Mashable reported. It also comes with an estimate of how much money you'll save by switching to solar. As Google pointed out in a blog post, about 79 percent of all rooftops across the country are qualified for the tech installation. In other areas — like Nevada, Arizona and Utah — that number jumps to 90 percent. According to Google the top 10 cities with the most solar potential are Houston; Los Angeles; Phoenix; San Antonio; New York; San Diego; Jacksonville, Florida; Oklahoma City; Dallas; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. “If the top 10 cities above reached their full rooftop solar potential, they'd produce enough energy to power 8 million homes across the U.S.,” according to Google. Much of Utah’s northern valley contains sunny pockets for solar tech, the Google Map showed. Much of the Northeast hovers around the 60 percent mark. Houston, Texas, tops the list, according to Mashable. Head to Project Sunroof to see whether or not your home could benefit from the solar technology. Utah’s connection to solar technology has been well-documented. According to Business Insider, Tesla founder Elon Musk once said Utah’s solar energy capabilities could power the entire country. Musk: "You could take a corner of Utah and Nevada and power the entire United States with solar power." #AGU15— Lauren Morello (@lmorello_dc) December 15, 2015 Utah is also home to solar companies like ION Solar, Vivint Solar and Rocky Mountain Power, which has its own solar energy installation program.

Google’s European operations chief has admitted that the tech giant ‘needs to get better’ at policing online videos in a public apology made at Advertising Week Europe. Speaking at the conference in London, Matt Brittin, Google’s president of EMEA business and operations, said: “I want to start by saying sorry. We apologise. When anything like this happens we take responsibility for it.” The EMEA boss dodged repeated questions over how Google would handle the ever growing scandal, one which has grabbed the public’s attention with high-profile brands such as Marks and Spencer pulling their contracts with Google. READ MORE: Tim Berners-Lee calls on Facebook, Google to fight fake news The scandal first came to the public’s attention following an investigation by The Times which revealed that YouTube ads sponsored by the UK government and big brands like Sainsbury’s were displayed next to inappropriate and extremist content. Mr Brittin acknowledged that some big name clients were ‘concerned’, but that Google would be making changes to ad policies. “We have a review under way on how we can improve. it’s been underway for some time and last week we went public to explain what we’re doing. And we’re accelerating that review,” said Mr Brittin. The tech giant pledged to revise how it controls and enforces appropriate advertising, as well as having more control over where ads are placed. The promises also extended to how questionable content is reviewed, with Google currently only reviewing content that has been flagged as inappropriate by users. However, Google blames the huge number of YouTube videos uploaded as to why it can not police content proactively. Mr Brittin was speaking as part of a session with Unilever CMO Keith Weed on ‘Building Brands in an Attention Economy’, Matt apologised to anyone affected and pledged to take action to tackle this issue. “We want to make this a safe space for you to work as brand builders, and we welcome the chance to work with the industry,” said Mr Brittin. Although admitting that Google needed to ‘get better’ at dealing with inappropriate content, Mr Brittin did say that Google’s tools worked ‘in the majority of situations’. However, although Mr Brttin may be confident in his company’s tools, the same cannot be said for its customers. The BBC, Lloyds, L’Oreal, Audi, Marks & Spencer and Havas are all said to have pulled their adverts following the Times investigation. Google is expected to release further details about its ad changes later this week.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 March 2017 by Military News Cisco Fellow pushing boundaries and making history This is a guest post written by Christine Johansen, a Cisco PR manager. You may not know Alissa Cooper personally, but you benefit from her work every time you go online. This graduate of Stanford and Oxford is a pioneer in protecting your privacy. She’s a Cisco Fellow who was instrumental in the design of Cisco Spark. And when the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meets next month in Chicago, she will become the first woman to ever chair that important standards body. Ask colleagues to describe her and you’ll hear words like “humble,” “passionate,” and “deep thinker.” When she isn’t doing all things IETF, she’s working behind the scenes with Cisco’s engineering teams to make sure they understand possible privacy implications of the design choices they make. I spoke with Alissa recently on topics ranging from her work at the IETF to her work in the collaboration group, to how the current political climate might impact the future of the Internet. Christine Johansen: Pretend you’re explaining the IETF to your family at Thanksgiving dinner. How would you explain what it does and why it is important? Alissa Cooper: Think about the last time you searched for something online. Maybe you typed http://www.google.com and some search terms and magically you got results back. In order for that to work, your computer and Google’s server had to talk to each other. If your computer only spoke English and the Google server only understood French, they wouldn’t be able to talk. You wouldn’t get your search results. Your computer and Google’s server needed a common language called a “standardized protocol” to be able to communicate.  The IETF produces standardized protocols for the Internet—including the one you’ve typed so many times in your life, “https”. These core networking standards make the whole Internet work. CJ: Great explanation… I can tell you’ve had to explain that a couple times! AC: Yes, a couple times…or eight thousand times! CJ: What are some of the trickier topics you’ve dealt with—things people might not expect to come up as you make standardized protocols? AC: Definitely privacy. It’s what got me working on standards in the IETF in the first place, nearly ten years ago. Back then I was working at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a technology policy organization in DC. There, we recognized that design choices that get baked into technical standards could affect the privacy of individuals on the Internet. So I started working in the IETF to affect change. Privacy is a thorny issue even at the IETF because really we’re creating building blocks that software developers will put together to make a product. When we’re creating a standard it’s impossible to predict every way it could possibly be used—you don’t know what products and uses of technology people will dream up.  So, we aim to build a standard with some recognition of what the privacy impact would be. I’ve focused on things with an interactive component: geolocation, identity, real-time communications, voice, video, and messaging. See also: Six imperatives to future proof your digital business CJ: Can you give me an example of a design choice that could impact privacy? AC: Say you have two computers that are communicating. It is very often useful for one end to have an identifier associated with it and for it to send that identifier with every communication—so the other computer can maintain some sort of knowledge about what has happened previously. So it can, for instance, say, “OK. This is coming from CJ’s computer. I remember the last data packet she sent me. This new packet must go with that earlier packet.” It would be useful to have the same identifier in every packet. Useful, but also possibly invasive of your privacy: if you have the same identifier for everything you do on the Internet, then suddenly everything you ever do on the internet can be correlated. Say you go to Google, then the Cisco website, then you call someone, then you read some news sites. If all share the same identifier, then anyone who has access to any of your Internet traffic or your computer can know everywhere you’ve been on the Internet. So there’s tension. The IETF asks: can we randomize those identifiers? Or can we refresh them on a regular basis? Or can we not use an identifier which is burned into the network card by the device manufacturer? Should it be stored anywhere except on your computer? Basically we try to strike a balance between the usefulness of a permanent identifier and the potential privacy risk that it creates for correlation of activities over time. CJ: When do you start as IETF chair? What does that role involve? AC: I start at our next meeting, which is the week of March 26th in Chicago. I will be charged with leading the Internet Engineering Steering Group, which provides the technical oversight for the IETF. I’ll also be generally responsible for keeping the trains running on time—making sure all the different pieces are on track and we have support to get our standards published. The IETF chair is a key member of all of the IETF leadership groups that define strategy and oversee the production, review and publication of standards. The IETF operates on a model called “rough consensus”. What that means is we don’t actually vote about anything. When we are deciding whether we should publish a particular standard, people come together and state any objections—we try to adopt changes to address the objections, or we at least acknowledge the objection. Once we have rough consensus documented in a “Request for Comments” (RFC), the IETF chair is then responsible for representing these consensus positions externally. There are more than 8,000 RFCs. In theory I’ll be responsible for explaining that body of work when there is a debate about a technical topic in the networking industry. CJ: The size and breadth of the IETF’s work is pretty remarkable! What are some of the big discussion topics right now? AC: IoT, virtualization/automation and security are three technical trends that we have been grappling with for awhile; they will likely continue to absorb a lot of focus. The standards landscape for IoT is fragmented and would benefit from some consolidation. The IETF will continue to play an important role. We’ve already done lower layer networking standards for IoT—like how do you run IPv6 over existing IoT access technologies. We’ll continue to focus on that but my hope is that we’ll also bring it up a level. For instance, we need to get it so that one manufacture’s light bulb understands another manufacturer’s switch. For that to happen, manufacturers need to represent “on” and “off” the same way. That’s called “semantic interoperability”, and it’s lacking. I hope to see progress there, and also in IoT security. We also have work going on around automation, network virtualization, and software-defined networking. This whole revolution around taking the intelligence out of hardware and putting it into software in terms of how we route Internet traffic and how we manage it, how we orchestrate network operations—it’s going to continue in the industry and at the IETF. Through the IETF’s work, the industry has settled on a “model-driven networking” approach to boost interoperability and avoid creating massive industry fractures. Certainly security in general has been a huge focus for us, even more so over the last couple of years. We all still use many protocols that were defined in the 1990s, before there was as intense of a focus on security as there is today; the IETF is working to beef those up and create more secure versions. Cisco is deeply invested in the growth of the Internet, and we have always recognized the importance of open standards, so it’s natural that we will continue to strongly support the IETF. CJ: IoT, SDN, security—those are key areas for Cisco as a whole. And Cisco has been a big supporter of the IETF for a long time—can you talk about that? AC:Cisco is deeply invested in the growth of the Internet, and we have always recognized the importance of open standards, so it’s natural that we will continue to strongly support the IETF. We invest because these standards are at the very core of our business. However, it is also interesting for us because things are changing. For a lot of the core networking standards, the focus has shifted to operationalization, management, orchestration, and new services. The IETF community is also recognizing that open source is a new outlet for their energy, and there are questions around how open source and open standards work together. For Cisco it is very important to make sure both open standards and open source continue to co-exist and are symbiotic. Weaving the two together is going to be very important for us as an industry moving forward and Cisco has spent a lot of effort and resources to catalyze that relationship. CJ: You spend about half your time on IETF; the other half you spend in Cisco’s Collaboration Technology Group. What do you do there? AC: I work on Jonathan Rosenberg’s CTO team and focus on privacy, policy, and regulatory issues. I work closely with engineering teams as they make design decisions that could affect privacy. When I joined three years ago, we needed to make big decisions as we started to develop Cisco Spark. We were transitioning from premise infrastructure that didn’t collect any data to the cloud where all sorts of data might be collected. I spent a ton of time with the team thinking through the architecture; what data we would collect; how we would secure it; who would have access to it and how long we would retain it. I also lead these types of conversations throughout Cisco and liaise with other parts of the company to align our strategy on privacy and regulatory issues. CJ: From your perspective, what is the biggest accomplishment in the Cisco Spark platform? AC: The end-to-end encryption is remarkable. It has yielded a superior product while challenging the team to be innovative in its development process. When you’re building this kind of messaging product, frankly, you’re used to having immediate access to the content of the messages so you can refine the product and debug.  The Cisco Spark team doesn’t have that—it has never had that. Frankly, other teams would have abandoned the idea long ago. The fact that the team has built this product from that commitment to security and privacy is a huge accomplishment. It is a huge differentiator. Totally embedding it into the design required a huge mindset change. See also: Meet Cisco Spark Board CJ: How did you get into this field in the first place? AC: I started programming a little in high school and just really liked it. It was like a big logic puzzle. So I studied computer science at Stanford.  But I always wanted to do something that had an impact on people; I couldn’t see myself building some obscure piece of software that’s only deeply embedded in the internals of a product; I’ve always known that would never be for me. I took two classes in college on technology policy and those were some of my favorites. After college my then boyfriend now husband got a job in DC and so I was looking for jobs there and I found the job at CDT which was really perfect—I could be a technical person but I could also have an impact on something that matters to people.  In that role I got to do some small research projects, the aim of which was to influence policy. Through that experience I decided to see if I wanted to do research full time, so I went to Oxford to get my PhD. and… CJ: Wait. Let’s pause there because that is very, very cool. How long does it take one to get a PhD from Oxford? AC: It took me four years. They tell you that you can do it in three but I was also working part-time and stayed active in the IETF throughout; I didn’t want to leave the workforce for fear that I’d become a permanent student and never go back. When I finished, the opportunity at Cisco came up and it seemed like such a great fit. I wanted to keep working with the IETF and continue working on privacy matters and Cisco was the best place for me to do both. CJ: You’ve definitely blazed your own trail. How did you do that? And what advice do you have for others? AC: It’s not easy—you have to get and stay really in tune with yourself. In tech I was struck by how cookie-cutter the jobs being offered were. “You will be a client software developer or you will be a cloud software developer. Here is the job description – you will do these ten things.” That will never sing to me.  The first step of blazing your own trail is recognizing what really motivates you and gets you going and makes you want to get up and go to work every day. Finding people who have similar interests or have done it before you –that’s important. I didn’t set out to blaze my own trail. I set out to do something that was satisfying and interesting and oh by the way also pays the bills. It’s not always possible, but you won’t find out if you don’t try. CJ: You said you were interested in coding in high school. I think it’s fair to say that’s not the top choice of most high-school girls.  Did you have a mentor at a young age? AC: Well, I did – but it wasn’t a woman and it wasn’t a computer scientist. It was my dad. He is brilliant and driven and has a remarkable life story. He went to college when he was 16, and while he was there his father died and he basically took over running both the household and the family laundromat business …and then went on to get his PhD. from Yale. He always wanted me to do the thing that I was most interested in, the thing that makes me happy. That’s the biggest lesson I learned: follow your passion. CJ: Wow—that’s a great story. I also heard that you are a gymnast and a triathlete. Can you tell me about that? AC: I was a gymnast my whole life until I graduated college. I started when I was four, competed at the elite level in high school and later at Stanford. It was an amazing experience and my teammates are still my best friends. It’s how I met my husband—he is a gymnast, too. For most women—myself included—you can’t really do gymnastics past age 20 or so for safety purposes so I needed to find something else to do. I had always run and swam for fitness, so in the mid 2000s I started doing Olympic-distance triathlons. Since I had a baby—a girl, she’s almost two—I haven’t been racing competitively – only racing after her. CJ: What are your thoughts on the US travel ban and its impact on the IETF’s work, and the current political climate in general—does it pose any challenges for the IETF? AC: The current chairs of the IETF leadership bodies wrote this blog post regarding the travel ban. It’s a good articulation of the potential impact and I agree with what they said. Regarding the political climate, there has always been a certain amount of tension between the notion of a “borderless” global Internet and nations’ desires to exercise their sovereign rights within their borders. Part of what everyone loves about the Internet is how easy it is to connect to people and services regardless of where in the world they are. But of course, governments have a desire to regulate within their own territories. And that can mean we end up with different rules about who can travel to where, which data can be stored where, which encryption algorithms can be used where, and how services can be designed or delivered to different populations. Those differences present challenges to the seamless interconnectivity that is at the core of the Internet. The rise of nationalist policies and politics that we’re currently seeing has the potential to exacerbate this tension in all of these ways and more. The IETF develops standards for the whole Internet — not for any single jurisdiction or for the tenure of one administration. No one knows exactly what developments are coming down the pike, but I think we can expect to see that aspect of our work face some intensified challenges in the near and foreseeable future. ### The contents or opinions in this feature are independent and may not necessarily represent the views of Cisco.

The image library says providers like Google "do nothing" to detect or prevent copyright infringement and that safe harbors actually encourage them to turn a blind eye. The notion that online platforms should not be held responsible for the infringing acts of their users is something entrenched in law in many regions, including the United States and Europe. In Australia, however, a perceived drafting error in the implementation of the Australia – US Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) means that safe harbor provisions only apply to commercial Internet service providers. As a result, Google, Facebook, YouTube and similar platforms face copyright uncertainty, a tenuous position also suffered by schools, universities, museums, libraries and archives. If proposed amendments to the Copyright Act are adopted, all of the above will receive enhanced safe harbor protections and the country into be brought into compliance with AUSFTA. Instead, however, battle lines are being drawn, with technology companies on one side and heavily copyright-reliant entities on the other. Today it’s the turn of Getty Images to throw its hat into the ring. Getty has been embroiled in dozens of copyright lawsuits in its history so is well aware of the difficulties its business can encounter. It’s also strongly against safe harbors that would allow companies like Google to use its images in search results, for example, without having to shoulder any liability. Speaking with The Australian (paywall), Getty Images’ general counsel Yoko Miyashita says that safe harbors have been ruthlessly exploited by online platforms and actually make it harder for copyright holders to protect their rights. “Here in the US the safe harbors were intended to provide strong incentives for online ­service providers and copyright holders to co-operate to detect and deal with copyright infringements … but that has never materialized,” Miyashita says. “There is no incentive for co-operation. The safe harbors are instead used by service providers as a shield and an excuse for doing nothing to detect or prevent copyright infringement.” When service providers become aware that their platforms are being used for infringement in a specific case, it’s argued that they are required to take remedial action to bring them into compliance and maintain their safe harbor protections. But for the Getty general counsel, all this does is force technology platforms to look even further in the opposite direction to avoid knowledge, rather than getting sucked into a copyright minefield. Becoming involved in steps to prevent piracy can even mean they become further exposed. “In fact, we have seen that ­service providers risk greater ­liability if they take steps to detect and prevent infringements, so they are encouraged to stick their head in the sand,” Miyashita said. While the music, movie and TV show companies have their specific complaints against Google, Getty Images feels it is particularly exposed by the search giant’s actions. While movies and TV shows are largely streamed or downloaded from third-party sites to which Google merely links, Getty’s images appear in results themselves, ready to be shared with others with a couple of clicks. Results can be taken down of course, but the onus lies with copyright holders to take action in each and every case, something which sees Google process millions of takedown notices every week. “Each of those reports represents an instance where copyright holders were not com­pensated for use of their works,” Miyashita notes. “This shows not only the burden on copyright holders to identify infringements and prepare and send notices…but also the lack of respect for copyright which has been fuelled in large part by the safe harbors.” That Getty Images should single out Google in the safe harbor debate comes as no surprise, as the companies rarely see eye to eye when it comes to the use of Getty’s images. Last year the stock photograph outfit filed a complaint with the European Union’s antitrust commission, claiming that Google is engaged in piracy of its content. Getty told the EU that Google undermines its business by utilizing Getty stock images in a manner that “siphons traffic” away from the Getty’s own website. Considering that safe harbor provisions are standard across Europe and the United States, the battle underway in Australia is something of an anomaly. That being said, the fact that Australia-based technology companies are now being forced to fight entertainment and heavily copyright-dependent industries to achieve their goals is nothing new and is only likely to drive the parties apart – or investment away. At the moment the momentum is in favor of safe harbor introduction, but things are only just getting heated up and are far from over.

How to get alerted when your name is used online In today's competitive environment, marketing intelligence is more important than ever before. We look at seven tools for monitoring media mentions both on the web and in social media. By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | March 20, 2017 -- 16:23 GMT (09:23 PDT) | Topic: SMBs (Elena Elisseeva, Getty Images/iStockphoto) If you're already a regular user of that powerful free service called Google Alerts, this article will cover some familiar ground. For the rest of you, read on... I'm surprised how many active internet users forget about Google Alerts. Case in point: The job of PR folks is pitching their clients' products and services to writers and reviewers like my colleagues here on ZDNet. These PR folks often ask me to tell let them know when I write about their clients. When I mention Google Alerts, some tell me they never heard of it -- or forgot about it. special feature Small Business TV - Video Series Learn how the leaders of small businesses and startups can use technology to overcome obstacles, drive innovation and efficiencies, and compete against larger incumbents. Read More Of course, you don't need to be a PR agent to want to know if you, your company, your brand, or even a topic you follow has received coverage. If you're at all in the public eye (or want to be), tracking mentions is a good idea. In this article, I'll tell you how to set up Google Alerts, show you an alternate service I also use, and discuss some options for free social media monitoring. But first, a little history.... Media monitoring is so 19th century A century and a half ago -- before Google, Facebook, television, even before radio -- there was media. There were newspapers in every city, and reporters were writing stories. Even then, companies and certain individuals needed to know if they'd received press coverage. Recognizing that need, a service was launched.The first media monitoring service in history was launched in 1852, Wikipedia notes, by "a Polish newsagent named Romeike." Windows 10 problem solvers: My must-have... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 16 NEXT PREV Picture how this worked: Runners in each major city gathered up print copies of newspapers as they came off the presses, packed them up, and sent them via train and horseback to central offices filled with hundreds of readers. Those readers combed through each paper, scanning the newsprint, searching for mentions of their clients. When a mention was found, they actually cut out the article with scissors and it was sent on to their clients. Media monitoring was a huge, messy, complex logistical process. According to Jim Connor, dean of the School of Business and Information Technology at Northwestern Polytechnic University, "Marketing intelligence has always been critically important. Not only do you want to know about positive mentions, but if there was anything negative mentioned about you, your company, or your brand, you want to be able to get started doing damage control as soon as possible." Here's how to do that. While there are commercial services that track print, radio, and TV mentions, we'll focus on the free services that can help you monitor web and social media mentions. Monitoring web mentions There are two services that will get you pretty good media monitoring and won't cost a penny. Since most print coverage now makes its way to the web, if you want to know where you've been mentioned -- as long as you're not searching for TV mentions -- you can use either Google Alerts or Talkwalkers. I use both. Google Alerts allows you to set up keyword monitoring for either words or phrases. You can get as-it-happens (as Google scans) alert emails, or you can get email messages sent once a day or once a week. I have Google alerts set up for my name (and all of the common misspellings), as well as some other brands I'm interested in. How to set up a Google Alert: Point your browser at Google.com/alerts. Make sure you're logged into a Google account. You'll need one for this service. In the big blue box at the top of the page, enter the brand or phrase you're looking for. Click Create Alert or Show Options. I recommend clicking Show Options. Choose how often. You can choose to get updates as soon as Google finds new mentions or have them batched to once a day or once a week. Your mailbox flow will dictate your choice here. Choose source. You can limit your source to news or blogs or discussions (and more), but I like automatic. Google determines if a mention is relevant and useful and sends it along. Limit by language and region. I monitor "Any Region" to get worldwide coverage, but I limit the responses to English because (not counting C and C++) that's my native language. Specify how many. You can have Google firehose you every mention or have the flow limited to just the best, highest quality mentions. This gets rid of most of the more spammy mentions and can save you time and inbox clutter. Finally, you can specify where your alerts are sent. A cool feature of this is that you can set up an RSS feed, which means you can use a newsreader or even add automated systems to further build on the alerts you track. Another service, which does cross-over Google's coverage, but also sometimes finds unique stuff, is Talkwalker Alerts. Like with Google, you can set up names, phrases, and keywords to be scanned. You can also set frequency. I've found that most of the time Talkwalker duplicates Google Alerts' results, but sometimes they send me mentions that Google doesn't. Yet another service in this space is Social Mention. Oddly enough, Social Mention doesn't actually monitor social media mentions. It, too, spiders the web. Social Mention won't send you alerts, but you can create an RSS feed of your keyword, and you can also do an instant search. One thing Social Mention does that may be of value is provide a graph of sentiment analysis, indicating how people across the web are feeling about the keyword. Social media mentions I've found that Google Alerts will sometimes pick up a Twitter mention, but not very often. There are services out there that are designed to help you monitor social media mentions. There is a challenge here, particularly with Facebook. Since Facebook is a walled garden and most of its content is only accessible to "friends," any monitoring you do on Facebook will be limited to those people who either post publicly or are within the scope of the friends list of the account you use for monitoring. That said, the Big Kahuna of social media monitoring is Hootsuite. Hootsuite has a free option that will let you monitor up to three social profiles. A social profile is a social media account, like your Twitter account, Facebook profile (or page), Instagram, or YouTube. Here are some other social media monitoring services: eClincher: The unfortunately named eClincher has a free trial, but after 14 days, you'll have to buy into the service. Still, it's worth testing out. Zoho Social: Zoho Social only connects to your Facebook page, not your Facebook profile. That's a big limitation. Also, it doesn't support monitoring YouTube posts. Zoho Social does have a free account, but it's limited to just one brand. Friends+Me: Friends+Me is probably the least known, but it's surprisingly popular among my colleagues in the press. When I was researching social media managers, my editorial colleagues kept mentioning the service. The big draw of Friends+Me is its tight Google+ integration. It has a 15-day free trial. In addition to monitoring, all of these services also allow you to respond to posts, publish posts, and schedule posts. I'll be looking at some of them in more depth in future articles.

Quotes in the article Marks & Spencer Group PLC MAKSY ▼ 8.10 -0.13 -1.58% Publicis Groupe SA PUBGY ▼ 16.58 -0.06 -0.37% McDonald's Corp MCD ▼ 129.09 -0.01 -0.01% HSBC Holdings PLC HSBC ▼ 40.48 -0.03 -0.07% The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic and anti-semitic messages, prompting a flood of major companies to follow suit. Britain is the largest market for Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google outside the United States, generating $7.8 billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly 9 percent of the U.S. giant's global revenue. "I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Google EMEA President Matt Brittin said at the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London. Besides well-known British brands pulling the plug, some of the world's biggest advertising companies responsible for placing vast amounts of marketing material for clients, said they were reviewing how they worked with Google. The boycott is the latest clash between advertising companies and the internet giants that have built up dominant positions in digital advertising by offering not only huge audiences but also the ability to apply their user data to make ads more targeted and relevant. For big advertising groups such as WPP (WPP.L), internet firms are both a client and a competitor, while traditional media groups such as newspapers and general online news publishers are having to compete with them for online dollars. HOSTILE INDUSTRY "Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe ... and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings," said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group. "Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem," he said. WPP, the world's largest advertising firm, said on Monday it was talking to clients and media partners such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished. "We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements," said Martin Sorrell, the founder and head of the British firm. Publicis (PUBP.PA), the world's third largest advertising firm, said in a statement on Monday that it was clear Google had fallen short of meeting advertising standards and that the French company was reviewing its relationship with Google. Google said on Friday it worked hard to remove ads appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute it did not always get it right. Brittin said Google had made a commitment to doing better and would simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investment to enforce its ad policies faster. A spokeswoman for Google UK said it would look again at the way it defines incendiary commentary and hate speech to raise the bar on videos and sites allowed for advertising. On Friday, Google executives were called in to face questions from the advertising industry and Britain over the issue. Representatives for retailers Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) and Argos, British banks HSBC and RBS (RBS.L), McDonald's, the UK branch of advertising group Havas (HAVA.PA) and the BBC told Reuters their firms had stopped ads. A source at Lloyds Banking (LLOY.L) said the lender had pulled the plug as well. Others such as Vodafone (VOD.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and Tesco (TSCO.L) were reviewing policies, their representatives said.

 Apple is on the defensive as it prepares the iPhone for the fight of its life Matt Weinberger Mar. 20, 2017, 1:00 PM 28,973 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.Getty/Chris Hondros Apple is working on a pair of Google Glass-style smart glasses powered by your iPhone, Bloomberg reports. And it's no surprise why: Apple CEO Tim Cook has said augmented reality, the technology used to project computer-generated imagery onto your field of vision, is "a big idea like the smartphone." What Cook won't say, however, is how Apple's move to AR is a defensive move to preserve the supremacy of the iPhone, its most important product, for another decade. In a recent interview with Business Insider, Microsoft technical fellow Alex Kipman, the chief inventor of Microsoft's pioneering HoloLens "hologram" goggles, said he saw augmented reality as replacing the need for a smartphone. After all, if your text messages, photos, and phone calls are projected onto what you see, why use a separate device? Now Apple has to figure out a way to make sure the iPhone stays relevant in that world. Meanwhile, its biggest competitors are preparing for an all-out assault on the concept of the smartphone itself. Self-contained Companies like Microsoft and Facebook are working hard to accelerate the demise of the smartphone and the rise of AR, attempting to sidestep the iPhone's dominance entirely. Importantly, Microsoft's HoloLens is a self-contained device, not requiring a connection to a PC or phone to function. That's a big deal for Microsoft, which has almost no presence in the smartphone market. It means that if the HoloLens takes off, Microsoft owns the whole thing. Similarly, companies like Facebook's Oculus and the mysterious Magic Leap are trying to build standalone augmented-reality and virtual-reality devices. The opportunity is tremendous — if they can capture that market, it wouldn't matter that they don't have smartphone operating systems because they'd own the next big thing. And Google is more committed to the Android operating system than to the traditional concept of a smartphone. The original Google Glass didn't need a phone to function, and it seems unlikely that the long-rumored Google Glass 2.0 would need one either. As long as whatever next-generation glasses come out run on Android, Google's strategy is satisfied. Microsoft's HoloLens is self-contained, requiring no PC or smartphone to function.Microsoft HoloLens All of this is an existential threat to Apple. Removing the need for a smartphone would demolish the market for the iPhone, the product Apple's strategy hinges on. We're years away from AR truly being mainstream, but the foundation is being laid. Now the burden is on Apple to get there first. If it can build an AR headset that depends on the iPhone to function, it can keep its all-important phone business alive for a long time. In Apple's ideal world, the iPhone sits at the center of the AR market. But if Apple fails, Microsoft, Google, Magic Leap, and Facebook are circling, ready to take advantage.

What happens when it makes cars? Updated by Timothy B. Lee Mar 20, 2017, 8:30am EDT tweet share Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg popularized the slogan “move fast and break things” to describe the breakneck pace of innovation at Facebook, and the phrase has become popular across Silicon Valley. So what happens when technology companies start to build a technology — self-driving cars — that can literally move fast and break not just things but people? It’s a crucial question not only for the major Silicon Valley companies working on self-driving technology — including Google, Uber, and Tesla — but also for regulators. The balance is tricky: If regulators are too lax, people could die from malfunctioning self-driving vehicles. But overregulation could delay the introduction of cars that drive themselves much better than a human driver, costing many more lives in the long run. So is it time for federal and state regulators to crack down on the self-driving free-for-all? There’s definitely more that officials could be doing. At a minimum, the federal agency in charge of car safety, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, could use additional resources to hire more technologists and build the infrastructure they’ll need to adequately monitor the industry’s evolution. “I've felt for a while that things have been a little bit out of control” on the regulatory front, industry analyst Edward Niedermeyer told me in an interview. A lot of self-driving car regulations are enforced at the state level, and technology companies have become adept at playing states against each other. In much of the US, “autonomous driving is a free-for-all,” writes Backchannel’s Mark Harris. “Uber taxis are transporting passengers in Pittsburgh, Google’s self-driving prototypes are criss-crossing Texas, and Tesla’s cars are taking over the wheel nationwide, with little official testing or licensing of the technology beforehand.” But tightening regulation too much could quite literally cost lives. Human-driven cars kill 100 Americans per day, on average. Once self-driving technology is perfected, it could dramatically reduce that death toll, saving thousands of lives every year. “Am I concerned about self-driving cars? Yes,” says Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina. “But I'm terrified about today's drivers.” Uber has repeatedly clashed with regulators Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Photo by Mike Windle/Getty Images for Vanity Fair Right now this debate is largely about Uber, a company that has a history of pushing the law to its limits and even misleading regulators. Uber’s culture is “Silicon Valley on steroids,” Niedermeyer told me. Uber has a reputation as a company with little concern for coloring inside the lines. For years, it has flouted municipal taxi regulations and dared local officials to do anything about it. A recent New York Times story reported that Uber even created a secret, fake version of its app to mislead city officials trying to enforce taxi laws against Uber drivers. Uber has taken this same confrontational approach when it comes to self-driving car regulations. In December, the San Francisco Examiner reported that a self-driving Uber car ran a red light in San Francisco. Uber blamed the car’s human driver, telling the New York Times that “this is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers.” But two anonymous sources at Uber told the Times that the car had actually been under software control at the time the car ran the red light. A software bug, not human error, had been responsible for the car running the red light, the Times reported. San Francisco cyclists also complained that Uber’s cars were making unsafe right turns across bike lanes, cutting off cyclists and potentially putting their lives in danger. Legally speaking, Uber’s cars probably shouldn’t have been on California streets at all. At least that’s Smith’s view. California law requires Uber to obtain a license before it operates self-driving cars on the streets. Uber didn’t get one. Uber argued that since it planned to have a human driver behind the wheel at all times, it wasn’t affected by the law. But California officials disagreed, and in December Uber was forced to ship its cars out of the state to Arizona, where state officials were more welcoming. The company finally patched things up with California regulators earlier this month. “These companies hold all the cards” An Otto self-driving truck delivers beer during a test run in Colorado. Otto These questions, in many ways, outstrip the current framework for how America regulates auto safety. Federal and state regulators share jurisdiction over car safety regulations. Traditionally, federal regulators oversaw car design while state officials licensed drivers. But in a self-driving world, there’s no longer a clear distinction between the two: The “driver” is a computer program running inside the car. So far, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the lead federal regulator, has taken a hands-off approach, effectively punting many important questions to the states. Uber and other technology companies have learned to play states against one another to get more favorable regulation. Niedermeyer is troubled by this dynamic. “You have states and cities competing with each other in order to become a hub for this new technology,” he said. “These companies hold all the cards, the local governments are doing whatever they can to attract them.” Otto is a self-driving truck startup that Uber bought last year. When it made its first public announcement last May, Otto tested a prototype self-driving truck in Nevada without getting the testing license required by Nevada law. When Nevada pressured Otto to come into compliance, Otto instead left the state, performing its next public demonstration in Colorado instead. As the largest state and the home of a number of technology companies, California seems to be the only state with the clout to insist on companies following their safety regulations. Other states worry that if they demand too much, the self-driving revolution will pass them by. Too much regulation would be worse than too little Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images It seems inevitable that lax regulation of self-driving cars will lead to some preventable deaths. Still, there’s a good argument that today’s permissive regulatory environment is the best approach. The reason: While self-driving cars are potentially dangerous, human drivers are definitely dangerous. “It's so easy to immediately focus on self-driving cars as the new and the scary and forget that every day 100 people die on the road,” Smith said. He says that about 90 percent of those fatalities are caused by human error — errors that self-driving cars could avoid some day. We don’t have enough data yet to say how today’s self-driving cars compare with today’s human drivers. What does seem likely, however, is that self-driving software will steadily get better over time, while human drivers won’t. And the sooner we reach the point where computers are safer than human drivers, the sooner we can start saving lives. In a sense, then, one of the big dangers of introducing self-driving cars before they’re ready is the risk that it could trigger a broader public backlash against self-driving technology. If self-driving cars kill a few people and trigger a public backlash, regulators could be forced to institute a far more draconian testing and licensing regime that could delay the introduction of self-driving cars by months or even years. And this could be a particularly big problem if a fatal crash is caused by a company like Uber with a reputation for cutting corners. A string of scandals focused on everything from workplace sexism to callous treatment of drivers has trained people to expect the worst from the company. So if a self-driving Uber car kills someone, it’s likely to trigger a broader public backlash that could have negative consequences not only for Uber but for the broader industry.

STEPHEN, S.C. (AP) — Eighth-grader Lakaysha Governor spends two hours on the bus getting back and forth to school each day. Thanks to a grant from Google, she can now use that time more productively and get her homework done. The aspiring forensic anthropologist is one of nearly 2,000 students in South Carolina’s rural Berkeley County who will ride to school on one of 28, Google-funded, Wi-Fi-equipped school buses unveiled Monday. The tech giant also has given the school district 1,700 Chromebooks, the stripped-down laptops on which many schoolchildren now do their class and homework. As more class assignments and homework migrate online, such long bus rides have generally counted as lost time in preparing for the next school day. But Google said it hopes to help expand the use of Wi-Fi on school buses in other rural areas elsewhere around the country.

Google has at least a decade-long relationship with Berkeley County, where it’s invested more than $1 billion in data center complexes since 2007, bringing more than 100 jobs. Google says it also has awarded nearly $2 billion in grants to local schools and nonprofits. Advertisement Google hopes to see the Wi-Fi program extended into other rural areas of the U.S., including locations where it already has data centers that process search queries and other information, according to Lilyn Hester, a Google spokeswoman based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The first such effort was launched last year in Caldwell County, North Carolina, where a data center already exists. The expansions are also needs-based, Hester said, and Google is focusing on rural places where broadband internet access has been slow to spread. “Why don’t we make that instructional time?” Hester said of officials who have mused about the time many students spend on school buses. Google is also looking for ways to make the high-tech buses useful outside of school hours, working with the school district and community on places the buses can go once the school day is done to bring connectivity elsewhere, such as a community center or fellowship hall. Lakaysha, the eight-grader who has her eye on Harvard, has internet access at home like most of her friends. But thanks to the WiFi buses, she can get ahead on her work. Teachers are happy, she said, because “more students are doing their homework.” And she said even rambunctious preschoolers aboard the bus are quieter in the mornings while older students are doing homework. “Now that we have the Chromebooks and the WiFi, they’re kind of quiet; so it’s good for everybody.” ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 LONDON: A top Google executive on Monday apologised after UK company and government adverts appeared alongside extremist content on its Internet platforms. The apology from Matt Brittin, president of Google's Europe, Middle East and Africa division, came after UK banks HSBC and RBS, along with major retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S), decided to suspend their adverts from appearing on platforms such as YouTube. "I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Brittin said in a statement. "We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously." Brittin said Google was already making improvements thanks to increased investment -- resulting in it "raising the bar for our ads policies, simplifying advertiser controls and adding safer defaults". In a statement Monday, HSBC said said it takes "breach of our digital advertising standards very seriously and have put advertising with Google on hold at this time". An M&S spokesman added: "In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through." The British arm of French advertising agency Havas suspended such advertising last week. Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, are the BBC, Guardian newspaper group and McDonalds UK. In the UK, a committee of MPs has meanwhile demanded that Google explain how government adverts have appeared on "inappropriate and hate-filled sites" and whether the government and advertisers will be refunded payments made to the US tech giant. A government spokesperson said Monday: "It is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content -- and that message was conveyed very clearly to Google.

The UK Government has suspended its marketing on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos with homophobic and anti-Semitic messages. And Google's European boss Matt Brittin said today he was sorry for 'advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content'. Google's European boss Matt Brittin (pictured today at the Advertising Week Europe event in London's West End) has apologised for allowing adverts to appear alongside offensive videos But the apology did not go far enough for home affairs select committee chair Yvette Cooper who said the company must do more to filter out extremist content. Britain is Google's second biggest market after the US, generating £6billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly 9 per cent of the firm's global revenue. And, speaking during the annual Advertising Week Europe event at Picturehouse Central in London's West End, Mr Brittin said sorry for the company's failings. He told the conference: 'I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content.'

Share this article Share Mr Brittin said Google was committed to doing better and would simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investment to enforce its ad policies faster. But Labour MP Miss Cooper, who has accused the company of 'profiting from hatred' in recent days, said the apology 'doesn't go far enough'. She told The Guardian: 'It isn't enough for Google to respond only when their advertising revenues take a hit.  'They are one of the biggest and most powerful companies on the planet. They can afford to do far more, far faster to deal with illegal and hate-filled content online.' Vile: Masked figures marching in a recruitment video for the banned far-Right National Action, which has only just been taken down from YouTube Last night, Marks & Spencer pulled its advertising from YouTube as part of a growing boycott over its failure to remove extremist content. The chain became the latest in a string of household names to suspend its marketing on the site because of concerns adverts are inadvertently funding terror groups. Ministers are facing demands to take action against the internet giant after the Daily Mail found neo-Nazi videos remained on YouTube despite repeated warnings. WHO HAS PULLED THEIR ADVERTISING FROM YOUTUBE? UK Government M&S HSBC Lloyds RBS McDonald's L'Oreal Audi BBC O2 Royal Mail Domino's  Fears about Google's political influence also mounted after it emerged the firm's bosses have met ministers at least once a month since the 2015 general election.  M&S yesterday followed HSBC, Lloyds, RBS, McDonald's, L'Oreal, Audi, the BBC, O2, the Royal Mail and Domino's in pulling its advertising from YouTube.   Today, Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said: 'Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe... and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings.' He added: 'Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem. WPP, the world's largest advertising firm, said today that it is talking to clients and media partners such as Google to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished. Founder Martin Sorrell said: 'We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company.  'They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.' Google's apology today did not go far enough for home affairs select committee chair Yvette Cooper (pictured) who said the company must do more to filter out extremist content Publicis, the world's third largest advertising firm, said today that it was clear Google had fallen short of meeting advertising standards and that the French company was reviewing its relationship with Google. Google said on Friday it worked hard to remove ads appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute it did not always get it right. It isn't enough for Google to respond only when their advertising revenues take a hit  Yvette Cooper, home affairs select committee chair A Google UK spokesman said it would look again at the way it defines incendiary commentary and hate speech to raise the bar on videos and sites allowed for advertising. On Friday, Google executives were called in to face questions from the advertising industry and Britain over the issue.  A Government spokesman said today: 'It is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content - and that message was conveyed very clearly to Google. 'The Cabinet Office has told Google it expects to see a plan and a timetable for work to improve protection of government adverts to ensure this doesn't happen again. YouTube advertising remains on hold while that work is carried out.' HOW THE YOUTUBE ROW HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST WEEK  Monday:  Google apologises to its 'partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content' Sunday: Marks and Spencer becomes the latest in a string of big names to suspend its marketing on YouTube Friday: The BBC and the Cabinet Office are among a host of organisations to pull their adverts from YouTube Friday: Havas, whose clients include O2 and Royal Mail, is claimed to be the first major global advertising company to announce that none of its budget will go to Google or YouTube Friday: Home affairs select committee writes to Google asking for an explanation after Government adverts were placed on 'hate-filled sites'  Thursday night: An investigation published by The Times claims that rape apologists, anti-Semites and hate preachers are among those receiving payouts from publicly subsidised adverts on Google's YouTube YouTube hands £6.15 of advertising revenue for every 1,000 views to those who post videos, meaning household names have unintentionally been funnelling cash to terror groups, neo-Nazis and homophobes. Many videos generate millions of hits. In a bid to halt the advertising exodus, Google has admitted it 'can and must do more', and has promised to make changes 'in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear.' But an M&S spokesman said yesterday: 'In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through.'  Google does not actively look for hate content on YouTube, instead waiting for users to flag it up. This has enraged many firms, which have found their brands promoted alongside terrorist videos. The advertising boycott comes as the close links that Google has built with the top of Government were revealed today. Prime Minister Theresa May, her predecessor David Cameron and Culture Secretary Karen Bradley are among 13 ministers who have held dozens of meetings with the internet giant since the election. The extent of the cosy relationship between Google and Whitehall has sparked fresh concerns over the scale of the firm's political clout. In the 17 months between May 2015 and September last year, ministers held at least 27 meetings with the web company. Data for the past six months has yet to be published. Mrs May met Google in July 2015, when she was home secretary, while the firm attended a business roundtable with then prime minister Mr Cameron that October.  Marks and Spencer last night pulled its advertising from Google's YouTube as part of a growing boycott over its failure to remove extremist content Internet safety minister Baroness Shields – a former Google managing director – met with her old firm seven times, which included discussions on online extremism. Baroness Shields, who was made a peer by Mr Cameron, is one of dozens of Google executives who have been through a 'revolving door' between the tech company and Government. The firm has hired at least 26 Whitehall staff, including No 10 aides, in the past decade. HOW PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING WORKS  1) Internet user clicks on an extremist website or YouTube video. 2) User’s internet address sent to ‘advertising exchanges’ - the most profitable is Google run DoubleClick. 3) Advertising agencies hired by companies bid on the exchange to place an advert on the site or video. In most cases, the advertiser has no idea where the advert will be placed. 4) Advertisers are supposed to be able to blacklist extremist websites, but this relies on video creators honestly and accurately categorising their uploads, which in the case of extremist content is extremely rare. 5) A slice of the advertiser’s fee is paid to the person or group who created the website or uploaded the video. Its staff have also headed in the opposite direction. Nigel Huddleston left his job as the search engine's industry head of travel after being elected as a Tory MP in 2015. Rachel Whetstone, a former aide to ex-Tory leader Michael Howard – and friend of Mr Cameron – later worked for Google as head of international communications. She is also married to the former PM's ex-strategist, Steve Hilton. The Tories lavished £312,000 on Google ads in the run-up to the election. Google chairman Eric Schmidt spent five years as a business adviser to Mr Cameron and previously gave the keynote speech at the Tory conference. According to marketing experts, extremists have made £250,000 from adverts for household brands and public bodies hosted on Google. The search giant has earned around £120,000. One of the biggest earning hate preachers is the Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghoneim, who is banned from visiting the UK. His YouTube channel has netted him around £65,000. The boycott of YouTube started on Friday, when ministers suspended all government advertising on the video- sharing platform until it could all but guarantee public money would not fund hate content. Officials learned that adverts for public bodies such as UK Aid and the Metropolitan Police had been running alongside YouTube videos containing extremist material.  Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Shocking moment terror attacker's car speeds across bridge Dramatic video shows horror of aftermath on Westminster Bridge Terrified public flee as three shots ring out in Parliament Square Commotion outside Parliament as police react after attack Injured people lay stricken on Westminster Bridge after attack Horrifying car crash scene shows victim at Parliament railings 'Go! go!'

What happens when Google pushes into branding and messaging? As Google elbows its way further into PPC branding, columnist Pauline Jakober discusses the drawbacks of automating tasks that impact messaging and branding. Pauline Jakober on March 20, 2017 at 9:38 am More If you’re in the business of marketing, you know how important branding is to your clients. And this is true whether it’s a print campaign, direct mail campaign, email campaign or pay-per-click (PPC) campaign. No matter which marketing channel you use, you and your client want tight control over the look and feel of your marketing collateral. Branding is so important for my PPC clients that my team will spend hours upon hours on images and messaging — and reviewing these with clients — to make sure they’re perfect before launch. Which is why the thought of Google inching into PPC branding makes me incredibly nervous. Are automatically generated PPC ads any substitute for personal, hands-on creation, review and approval? To find out, let’s take a closer look at two recent AdWords initiatives: responsive ads and Ads Added by AdWords. Responsive ads If you’ve been keeping up with changes in the PPC world (not easy!), then you’ll know that Google has made some changes to GDN (Google Display Network) campaigns. Until recently, PPC pros had two ad options on GDN (Google Display Network): display ads and text ads. Generally, display ads are larger and display at the top or side of web pages. Text ads are smaller and can fit almost anywhere. While we typically set up both types for clients, we often found that text ads converted really well for some industries. But as of January 31, Google has discontinued text ads within GDN campaigns. Instead, they want advertisers to use new responsive ads. Responsive ads sound great in theory. Similar to a responsive website, responsive ads can render in different sizes for display on different devices. As described in the AdWords help file: Responsive ads automatically adjust their size, appearance, and format to fit just about any available ad space. For example, your responsive ad might show as a native banner ad on one site and a dynamic text ad on another, as it automatically transforms itself to fit precisely where you need it to go to meet your advertising goals. This saves advertisers from having to make the same ad in multiple sizes — which can be quite time-consuming (and challenging for less design-proficient users). The problem with responsive ads When Google announced the change, we quickly worked to get responsive ads in place. AdWords gives advertisers four options for creating responsive ads: Responsive ad options As you can see, these options are: Scan website Upload Stock images Recently used We decided to start by testing the “scan website” option. Perhaps not surprisingly, the results were disappointing. We found that the images Google scraped from our client site were not ones we would have chosen. Indeed, sometimes the selected images were buried deep in the site and had little or no relevance to the ad. Consequently, we opted to go with the upload option, which requires two images and a logo. With the assets in place, it was pretty easy to set up. The process generated three ads: logo, square and vertical. But again, the end results were poor. Frankly, the ads were ugly. And we didn’t like not having precise control over the finished product. Of the three types, logo ads were somewhat more palatable. So maybe we could just use logo ads and ditch the square and vertical ads? No such luck. Advertisers must enable all three elements, or none. Oh well, we thought, at least we still have full control over display ads. If we’re lucky, maybe display ads will be given greater prominence than responsive ads. But no, as we continued our testing, we found that responsive ads are sometimes taking precedence over display ads. Example of a display ad   Example of a responsive ad (Maybe you’re thinking we’re being too picky. But I should point out that our clients have been complaining about responsive ads as well. When responsive ads are rendered on their screens, they call us and ask, “What did you do to our ads?”) Given this situation, many of our clients have been reluctant to proceed with responsive ads at all. For the moment, we’re encouraging them to stay with it long enough to gather some data. Maybe the data will surprise us. Maybe responsive ads will have awesome conversion rates. Maybe Google will improve the ads. But if things stay the same, and if results are poor, then we’ll have little choice but to pause responsive ads. To say this is frustrating is an understatement. We painstakingly craft GDN ads, reviewing them carefully with our clients. To have Google elbow its way into this process, and decide it can do better all on its own, is concerning. Ads added by AdWords If you’re unfamiliar with the “Ads Added by AdWords” pilot project, you can read more about it in this Search Engine Land article by Ginny Marvin. Basically, Google is testing a new initiative to automatically add new text ads to AdWords accounts. So far, according to the article, these ads are being created by real people. But presumably, if the program is to scale more broadly, then the process will become automated. The ads are built on existing ads in the accounts, as well as landing page content. According to the AdWords help file, the idea behind the project is to create ad variations that might help with campaign performance. Pilot participants are advised to not pause the ads and let them run indefinitely. Presumably, ads that perform less well will be shown less often. What’s especially concerning, as noted in this article, is that Google defaults these ads to live! It’s up to advertisers to pause the ads if they don’t want them. Again, this initiative has me (nervously) scratching my head. Do auto-generated ads make sense for sophisticated users? I suppose that if you’re running a campaign without the help of a knowledgeable PPC agency, consultant or in-house marketing team, then Ads Added by AdWords might be useful. If your organization’s approach to PPC campaigns is “set it and forget it,” then these extra ads could conceivably help performance. But for most PPC pros, that’s not the case. My clients, for example, have a real and enduring interest in their branding and messaging. They care deeply about the look and feel of their ads. This isn’t something they’re willing to leave to an algorithm, no matter how sophisticated. And it certainly isn’t something they’re willing to take outside of their approval process. I can see other problems with Ads Added by AdWords as well. As a PPC agency, we invest a lot of time in getting to know our clients. We learn about their business. We read up on their branding strategy. We look at what they’re doing in other marketing channels. And we make sure our ads fit in with and support these efforts. Can Google really take on that role based on what they can scrape from client websites? And this question goes beyond branding and messaging. Some of my clients are subject to strict government regulations, industry rules and internal company policies. How can Google take these into account? And then there’s the whole PPC “package” to consider. As stated in an email sent to advertisers selected for the pilot project, ad extensions are one source of new ad content, along with headlines, keywords and landing page information. And we’re glad that extensions are included, of course. But at the same time, extensions are something we diligently craft, in terms of strategy and content, in close collaboration with our clients. Again, how can Google’s automatically created ads accurately reflect the many complexities and nuances of our decision-making? And finally, it’s important to remember that client messaging changes all the time. If a university, for example, is having an open house on March 12, will Google know to not run an ad promoting this open house on March 13? Do you really want Google playing with your branding? I recognize that a lot of my concerns stem from unknowns. Unfortunately, the details of these initiatives remain murky. Maybe things will become more clear in the coming days. And maybe Google will listen to feedback and tweak these programs as needed. And maybe my concerns (and the concerns of my clients) will be adequately addressed. But still, I resist the notion of Google elbowing its way into automating tasks that impact messaging and branding. It’s just not that simple.

The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic and anti-semitic messages, prompting a flood of major companies to follow suit. Britain is the largest market for Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google outside the United States, generating $7.8 billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly 9 percent of the U.S. giant's global revenue. "I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Google EMEA President Matt Brittin said at the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London. Besides well-known British brands pulling the plug, some of the world's biggest advertising companies responsible for placing vast amounts of marketing material for clients, said they were reviewing how they worked with Google. The boycott is the latest clash between advertising companies and the internet giants that have built up dominant positions in digital advertising by offering not only huge audiences but also the ability to apply their user data to make ads more targeted and relevant. For big advertising groups such as WPP (WPP.L), internet firms are both a client and a competitor, while traditional media groups such as newspapers and general online news publishers are having to compete with them for online dollars. HOSTILE INDUSTRY "Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe ... and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings," said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group. "Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem," he said. WPP, the world's largest advertising firm, said on Monday it was talking to clients and media partners such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished. "We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements," said Martin Sorrell, the founder and head of the British firm. Publicis (PUBP.PA), the world's third largest advertising firm, said in a statement on Monday that it was clear Google had fallen short of meeting advertising standards and that the French company was reviewing its relationship with Google. Google said on Friday it worked hard to remove ads appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute it did not always get it right. Brittin said Google had made a commitment to doing better and would simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investment to enforce its ad policies faster. A spokeswoman for Google UK said it would look again at the way it defines incendiary commentary and hate speech to raise the bar on videos and sites allowed for advertising. On Friday, Google executives were called in to face questions from the advertising industry and Britain over the issue. Representatives for retailers Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) and Argos, British banks HSBC and RBS (RBS.L), McDonald's, the UK branch of advertising group Havas (HAVA.PA) and the BBC told Reuters their firms had stopped ads. A source at Lloyds Banking (LLOY.L) said the lender had pulled the plug as well. Others such as Vodafone (VOD.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and Tesco (TSCO.L) were reviewing policies, their representatives said.

A top Google executive on Monday apologised after UK company and government adverts appeared alongside extremist content on its Internet platforms. The apology from Matt Brittin, president of Google's Europe, Middle East and Africa division, came after UK banks HSBC and RBS, along with major retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S), decided to suspend their adverts from appearing on platforms such as YouTube. "I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Brittin said in a statement. "We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously." Brittin said Google was already making improvements thanks to increased investment -- resulting in it "raising the bar for our ads policies, simplifying advertiser controls and adding safer defaults". In a statement today, HSBC said said it takes "breach of our digital advertising standards very seriously and have put advertising with Google on hold at this time". An M&S spokesman added: "In order to ensure brand safety, we are pausing activity across Google platforms whilst the matter is worked through." The British arm of French advertising agency Havas suspended such advertising last week. Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, are the BBC, Guardian newspaper group and McDonalds UK. In the UK, a committee of MPs has meanwhile demanded that Google explain how government adverts have appeared on "inappropriate and hate-filled sites" and whether the government and advertisers will be refunded payments made to the US tech giant. A government spokesperson said today: "It is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content -- and that message was conveyed very clearly to Google. "The Cabinet Office has told Google it expects to see a plan and a timetable for work to improve protection of government adverts to ensure this doesn't happen again. "YouTube advertising remains on hold while that work is carried out." TOP TOP   Comments   Also Read Money Is your sensitive data like Aadhaar, PAN card details safe with the government?

Judge Gary Larson of Hennepin County, Minnesota, issued the warrant in February, report the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Ars Technica and TonyWebster.com, which was first to publicize the warrant. Police in Edina, Minnesota, told the judge they found that a fake photo used in a phony passport was available through Google images, but not through Yahoo or Bing. The fraudster used the passport to obtain $28,500 through a line of credit with the crime victim’s credit union. The warrant application is here. The photo on the passport wasn’t the crime victim’s image, but it was an image of someone who is similar in age. Police believe the fraudster believed the photo he or she obtained was that of the victim. The fraudster transferred the line of credit money into the victim’s savings account, and then into another account at Bank of America. Police want the internet address for people conducting the search, as well as their Social Security numbers and account and payment information. Police obtained the search warrant from the judge after Google objected to an administrative subpoena seeking the information. A Google spokesperson told the Minneapolis Star Tribune it would fight the warrant. “We will continue to object to this overreaching request for user data, and if needed, will fight it in court. We always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users,” the spokesperson said. Civil-liberties advocates and electronic-privacy experts criticized the warrant and raised questions about whether information obtained would be tossed. Among them was University of St. Thomas privacy law professor Rob Kahn. “I’m concerned both about ensnaring innocent people but also … that this become a pattern,” Kahn told the Star Tribune. “It’s certainly a scary slippery slope that they’re setting up here.” TonyWebster.com raised similar concerns, saying the information requested could reveal the names of neighbors, prospective employers, business associates, journalists or friends who searched for the name. “Could this type of search warrant be used to wrongly ensnare innocent people?” the blog asked. “If Google were to provide personal information on anyone who Googled the victim’s name, would Edina Police raid their homes, or would they first do further investigative work? The question is: what comes next? If you bought a pressure cooker on Amazon a month before the Boston bombing, do police get to know about it?” Previous: What was the buzz around ABA Techshow?

The Moscow Arbitration Court postponed consideration of the case on compulsory enforcement of the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) orders on Google, according to FAS representative. Read also Google requests settlement with Russia's antimonopoly watchdog — regulator "Consideration of the case was postponed to April 24," FAS representative said, explaining that it concerns discussion of a settlement agreement between FAS and Google. It was reported earlier that FAS was holding consultation with Google about the possibility of an amicable settlement. "As far as I know, in 15 hours, just now, one of my dear colleagues deputies is holding a meeting with them (Google). We have just agreed that these consultations (about an amicable agreement) will start today," Head of FAS Igor Artemyev told reporters. Artemyev said that he does not "what the company has come up with", so it is early to talk about the terms of the agreement. Google applied to the Federal Antimonopoly Service with a proposal to conclude an amicable agreement. For more than a year Google has been trying to challenge the decision of the antimonopoly authority which found the US corporation guilty of abusing its dominant position on the market of Android-based mobile applications (owned by Google), but until now all the courts sided with the FAS. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News March 23, 15:13 Kremlin slams absurd claims about alleged ‘Russian link’ to politician's murder March 23, 15:13 March 23, 15:48 IS claims responsibility for London terror attack — media March 23, 15:48 March 23, 13:42 Former member of Russia’s State Duma gunned down in Kiev March 23, 13:42 March 23, 15:10 Putin promises four-fold rise in Russian precision weaponry’s strike potential March 23, 15:10 In other media Реклама Photo 13 Futuristic supercars at the Geneva Motor Show 12 Record-breaking KAMAZ trucks 3 Russian, French scientists study permafrost lakes in Arctic Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Gas agreement signed by Russia, Ukraine and the EU Altai gas pipeline Economical sanctions against Russia Most read Now Today This week 1 Putin promises four-fold rise in Russian precision weaponry’s strike potential 2 Kremlin slams absurd claims about alleged ‘Russian link’ to politician's murder 3 Moscow shocked by former State Duma MP’s brazen murder in Kiev 4 Suspected killer of ex-Russian MP is at death’s door, doctors fight for his life 5 Russian ground forces may get new small-range air defense system by 2030 6 Russia’s General Staff to strengthen troops in western, Arctic directions 7 Russian aerobatic group flies advanced fighter jets for stunts at Malaysia aerospace show 1 Lavrov comments on Israel’s recent air raids against targets in Syria 2 Putin praises domestic weaponry capabilities 3 Arms depot blast triggers wave of explosions rocking northeastern Ukraine 4 Former member of Russia’s State Duma gunned down in Kiev 5 Diplomat points to Kiev’s ban on Russian Eurovision singer as ‘moment of truth’ for EU 6 Kiev bans Russian wheelchair-bound Eurovision contestant from Ukraine 7 Press review: 'Deep State' to bait Trump on Russia ties and Pentagon joins Moscow on Syria 1 Lavrov comments on Israel’s recent air raids against targets in Syria 2 FBI investigating Russia’s alleged meddling in US election 3 Former member of Russia’s State Duma gunned down in Kiev 4 Arms depot blast triggers wave of explosions rocking northeastern Ukraine 5 Russia ready to continue work on 5th generation fighter with India 6 Large-scale drills of Airborne, Aerospace Forces and Black Sea Fleet begin in Crimea 7 Putin praises domestic weaponry capabilities TOP STORIES CONFLICT IN SYRIA RUSSIA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY OIL& GAS INDUSTRY SPACE PROGRAMS Реклама News Russian Politics & Diplomacy World Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧World News Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / World News Tue, Mar 21, 2017 - Page 7　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Google bracing for questions over extremist ads ‘PROFITING FROM HATE’:Big-name brands, government agencies and advertising firms are asking how videos by extremists ended up being placed beside their ads The Guardian Google executives are bracing for a two-pronged inquisition from the advertising industry and the British government over the company’s plans to stop advertisements being placed next to extremist material. A slew of big-name companies, advertising firms and government departments have either pulled their adverts from Google and its YouTube video Web site or are considering whether to do so, with media giant Sky, telecoms group Vodafone and a trio of banks adding their names to a growing list over the weekend. Matt Brittin, president of Google’s Europe, Middle East and Africa business and operations, is one of two of the company’s executives due to speak at the annual Advertising Week Europe event, attended by major companies in the advertising world. Sources said Brittin was likely to face a flurry of questions about how ads for major brands ended up attached to videos by extremists, including hate preachers and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The ads help fund payments to the people who post the videos, with every 1,000 clicks worth about £6 (US$7.45). Experts estimate this could have been worth £250,000 to extremists. Brittin was among the first people to address delegates, speaking yesterday alongside Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed. Unilever declined to comment on whether it had suspended advertising through Google. Leading advertising agencies have been quick to react, with French marketing firm Havas, whose clients include O2 and Royal Mail, pulling its advertisements late last week. Publicis, the world’s third-largest advertising firm, said it was reviewing its relationship with Google and YouTube. The world’s largest advertising firm WPP, via its media-buying division GroupM, has stopped short of canceling ads, but has written to major clients asking them how they wish to proceed. GroupM chief digital officer Rob Norman told Sky News that Google should apologize publicly to companies whose reputation has been “compromised.” In a letter to the company, British Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper accused the company of “profiting from hatred.” And senior figures from Google were summoned to the British Cabinet Office last week over concerns that taxpayer-funded advertisements were appearing alongside “inappropriate” YouTube videos. Google executives apologized, but were told to come back to the office this week with a plan and a timetable to remedy the problem. The decision by Vodafone, Sky, HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland to suspend their ads, follows action last week by other major brands including McDonald’s, L’Oreal, Audi, Sainsbury’s, Argos and the BB. Government spending has also been suspended, while Tesco is understood to have “paused” spending on YouTube. “We take our responsibilities as an advertiser seriously and have a robust set of safeguards in place to make sure our adverts don’t appear on Web sites or content which may be dedicated to offensive themes,” BT said. While Google is yet to reveal what it plans to do, it is understood that advertisers will be told that they might not be making enough use of existing tools and it will offer to provide advice on how companies can better use these. The Guardian is among the organizations to have withdrawn its advertising. Ads for the Guardian’s membership scheme are understood to have been placed alongside extremist material after an agency acting on the media group’s behalf used Google’s AdX ad exchange, which uses an automated system known as programmatic trading.

Posted 21 Mar 2017 00:20 Updated 21 Mar 2017 12:35 A security guard keeps watch as he walks past a logo of Google in Shanghai, China, April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Aly Song/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS - Google apologised on Monday for allowing ads to appear alongside offensive videos on YouTube as more high-profile firms such as Marks & Spencer and HSBC pulled advertising for British markets from Google sites. The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic and anti-semitic messages, prompting a flood of major companies to follow suit. Britain is the largest market for Alphabet Inc's Google outside the United States, generating US$7.8 billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly 9 percent of the U.S. giant's global revenue. "I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Google EMEA President Matt Brittin said at the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London. Besides well-known British brands pulling the plug, some of the world's biggest advertising companies responsible for placing vast amounts of marketing material for clients, said they were reviewing how they worked with Google. The boycott is the latest clash between advertising companies and the internet giants that have built up dominant positions in digital advertising by offering not only huge audiences but also the ability to apply their user data to make ads more targeted and relevant. For big advertising groups such as WPP, internet firms are both a client and a competitor, while traditional media groups such as newspapers and general online news publishers are having to compete with them for online dollars. HOSTILE INDUSTRY "Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe ... and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings," said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group. "Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem," he said. WPP, the world's largest advertising firm, said on Monday it was talking to clients and media partners such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished. "We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements," said Martin Sorrell, the founder and head of the British firm. Publicis, the world's third largest advertising firm, said in a statement on Monday that it was clear Google had fallen short of meeting advertising standards and that the French company was reviewing its relationship with Google. Google said on Friday it worked hard to remove ads appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute it did not always get it right. Brittin said Google had made a commitment to doing better and would simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investment to enforce its ad policies faster. A spokeswoman for Google UK said it would look again at the way it defines incendiary commentary and hate speech to raise the bar on videos and sites allowed for advertising. On Friday, Google executives were called in to face questions from the advertising industry and Britain over the issue. Representatives for retailers Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's and Argos, British banks HSBC and RBS, McDonald's, the UK branch of advertising group Havas and the BBC told Reuters their firms had stopped ads. A source at Lloyds Banking said the lender had pulled the plug as well. Others such as Vodafone, Barclays and Tesco were reviewing policies, their representatives said.

Be the first to comment! By Elliot Silver ⋅ March 20, 2017 There are quite a few companies that are either using their .brand extension or plan to use their .brand extension. Google has its .Google extension, Barclays has its .Barclays extension, and Saxo Bank has its .Saxo extension, among many other companies. Earlier today, Neustar launched its Stats Hub product, a new tool for people and companies interested in the .brands space. According to Neustar, “The ‘Stats Hub’ is an interactive database of statistics on .brand domain usage including domains registered and utilization info (number resolving/non-resolving/redirecting etc), which is also categorized and can be filtered by brand, location, industry to find exactly the data you’re looking for.” I played around a bit with the tool and think it will become useful for me when doing research on the new domain extensions. One of the more interesting searches that can be done is finding the number of domain names registered in each .brand extension. Using the tool, I saw that MMA IARD (an insurance company with the .MMA extension) has the most .brand domain names registered (1,754 total domain names). Audi has the most resolving domain names registered on its .Audi domain name extension (476 domain names resolving). There are quite a few additional data points that can be found using the new tool.

The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic and anti-semitic messages, prompting a flood of major companies to follow suit. Britain is the largest market for Alphabet Inc’s Google outside the United States, generating US$7.8 billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly 9 per cent of the US giant’s global revenue. “I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content,” Google EMEA President Matt Brittin said at the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London. Besides well-known British brands pulling the plug, some of the world’s biggest advertising companies responsible for placing vast amounts of marketing material for clients, said they were reviewing how they worked with Google. The boycott is the latest clash between advertising companies and the Internet giants that have built up dominant positions in digital advertising by offering not only huge audiences but also the ability to apply their user data to make ads more targeted and relevant. For big advertising groups such as WPP, Internet firms are both a client and a competitor, while traditional media groups such as newspapers and general online news publishers are having to compete with them for online dollars. Hostile industry “Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe ... and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings,” said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group. “Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem,” he said. WPP, the world’s largest advertising firm, said today it was talking to clients and media partners such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished. “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements,” said Martin Sorrell, the founder and head of the British firm. Publicis, the world’s third largest advertising firm, said in a statement today that it was clear Google had fallen short of meeting advertising standards and that the French company was reviewing its relationship with Google. Google said on Friday it worked hard to remove ads appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute it did not always get it right. Brittin said Google had made a commitment to doing better and would simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investment to enforce its ad policies faster. A spokeswoman for Google UK said it would look again at the way it defines incendiary commentary and hate speech to raise the bar on videos and sites allowed for advertising. On Friday, Google executives were called in to face questions from the advertising industry and Britain over the issue. Representatives for retailers Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s and Argos, British banks HSBC and RBS, McDonald’s, the UK branch of advertising group Havas and the BBC told Reuters their firms had stopped ads. A source at Lloyds Banking said the lender had pulled the plug as well. Others such as Vodafone, Barclays and Tesco were reviewing policies, their representatives said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Smartphone device can test sperm quality Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Montblanc just launched a smartwatch — here’s why it matters China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles AT&T, Verizon join Google ad boycott Facebook tunes trending topics to better deliver news Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites Google moves to restrict ads on fake news sites Google announces updates to its app and video ad functions Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

By Charles Riley LONDON (CNNMoney) -- Google has issued a public apology to major advertisers after their spots were featured alongside content from hate preachers and other extremists. "I would like to apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Google executive Matt Brittin said at an industry conference in London on Monday. "We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously." Several major companies and ad agencies have pulled their ads from Google and YouTube in recent days after a newspaper investigation showed their product pitches were being displayed on content including videos from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The British government said last week that it would temporarily restrict its advertising on the company's platforms. It has been joined by The Guardian, Marks & Spencer and French marketing giant Havas, which represents clients including O2 and Royal Mail. Google and Facebook own huge chunks of the digital advertising business, and brands are spending an increasing share of their ad budgets on their platforms. Like other tech firms, Google relies on users to report inappropriate content posted to its platforms. Flagged content is then reviewed -- a process that Google says takes less than 24 hours in 98% of cases. But the company admits it needs to do better. Brittin said that Google would set a higher standard for videos and sites against which advertisements appear. He also said that brands would be given more control over where their ads appear. "We are looking at accelerating changes to policy controls and enforcement that will help us to do better," he said. "We need to improve and we will do." Martin Sorrell, CEO of the global advertising firm WPP, said that Google must do more. "We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company," he said. "They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements." At least one market analyst has downgraded shares in Google from "buy" to "hold" over the issue. "We think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions," said Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group. "Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero tolerance policy." -- Nina dos Santos contributed to this article.

The answer should really start with a rhetorical "why wouldn't you?" But the reality is that we often come up with excuses for why we shouldn't share our expertise with others in our industry or outside of it. The fear of revealing too much or giving valuable knowledge away for free has prevented many a marketer or businessperson from achieving career goals and receiving a myriad of other benefits, such as... Branding yourself and your company as industry thought leaders and subject-matter experts Increasing audience reach, including other types of audiences Making new connections and building relationships with influencers and publishers Driving traffic—and leads—to your website Increasing brand awareness and credibility (when your entire team guest posts) So, how do you start? There's not just one way to begin guest-posting, but the steps outlined in this guide will walk you through a few approaches, plus some best-practices and suggestions. 1. Identify your area of expertise You must first identify the topics you are capable of writing about and which you want to specialize in, before you begin your search for websites that are an appropriate fit—i.e., they cover similar topics and they reach the audience you want to reach. So, ask yourself: What subjects do I know the most about? How many topics should I explore? How much experience do I have in these topics? What would set me apart from other bloggers? 2. Research potential host websites Explore Current Relationships Do you have any industry connections who manage a publication? Consider exploring those current connections to build a firm writing foundation prior to pitching to an editor you don't know. Industry Websites You may already have a mental list of industry websites to which you would love to contribute, but there may be additional publications that you haven't considered that are even better opportunities. After compiling your list of popular industry websites, continue searching for websites you might not be aware of. Along with a regular Google search of your industry topics and blog list, you can use BuzzSumo to discover which industry influencers also have blogs. In the document or tool you're using to record your findings, note whether the site has previously published guest posts and whether you can apply to become a contributor or submit an article. If the website doesn't have a search bar or an easily accessible contributor page (which you can often find in the main or footer navigation), you can search for the following: "Guest post" site:domain.com "By guest author" site:domain.com "Keyword" site:domain.com And, of course, search for the following to find other relevant websites: "Keyword" "guest post" "Keyword" "write for us" Non-Industry Websites Publishing Similar Topics For a less website-focused approach, search for high-performing articles, either in search engine rank or social shares, that are on the same or similar topics. Those articles will lead you to websites that are more likely to publish your articles because they have already successfully covered similar topics; however, you will still need to search the websites to confirm guest post opportunities. To find relevant articles, search for a keyword phrase in a Google blog search or BuzzSumo. When you find an article on a relevant topic, or an article similar to the ones you would like to write, note the publish date. You want to evaluate whether they still consider your topic relevant to the website and its audience; you also want to confirm that the article wasn't published too recently, therefore negating your article-topic pitch. Where Are Your Colleagues and Competitors Blogging? The simplest approach would be to directly ask your colleagues where they prefer to guest-post and whether they have seen much success with certain websites. If your colleagues are posting on a website you haven't considered, odds are you should want to be there, too. If you prefer not to ask, search for a colleague's or competitor's name in Google blog search, or include "guest post" along with his or her name in a regular search. Alternatively, you could search competitor backlinks to identify the websites that are linking to them from a guest post. To find a site's backlinks, use SEMRush or Moz's Open Site Explorer; these tools can be handy for evaluating your own website if you don't know how to access them in your own search console. Perhaps there is a guest blogging opportunity on a website that is already linking to you. Read Contributor Guidelines After qualifying websites that publish guest posts and accept submissions, thoroughly review their guest post guidelines, which, in some cases, you may need to request, although they are usually accessible through the navigation or by searching the following: intitle:guest post guidelines site:domain.com. Some require a certain level of expertise to become a contributor. Some may require links to previous articles, and others are content with basic biographical information and article ideas. If you believe you meet the website's standards, consider how you can best convey your qualifications. 3. Qualify and prioritize websites You may not have the bandwidth to write a few guest posts in a short period. Have that in mind when you pitch article ideas to several websites at once. What will happen if they all respond with interest? Developing relationships and establishing yourself as a solid industry writer takes time, so give yourself enough bandwidth to write high-quality articles instead of focusing on quantity. It may be difficult to restrict the number of sites you reach out to if you have a large list and you aren't sure which ones are the best opportunities. To determine which sites you should start with, evaluate: How much writing experience you have Which sites will help you meet your primary goal What the quality of the website is Becoming a contributor on entrepreneur.com is going to be more difficult than writing for a lesser-known site. If you do not have a list of published articles and strong personal branding, you may want to reserve that outreach until you have more articles under your belt. Prioritize websites based on your overall goal: Do you want to drive traffic to your website or generate leads? Do you want to establish yourself as an industry thought leader? Do you simply want to share your ideas? Once you have qualified your list based on your requirements, you can also use the following metrics to help you prioritize sites based on quality (depending on how you define it): Estimated monthly website traffic Domain authority Number of article shares (for specific articles) 4. Brainstorm article ideas Crafting article ideas beforehand will help you write a more effective pitch. Take time phrasing your article ideas, as they could be the first impression you give of the article quality and relevancy, although you can certainly rephrase them later. Ask yourself: What would I like to write about? What is currently on the website I'm targeting? Which articles are the most trafficked or shared on the website? What would be a popular topic for the audience? What keywords could help boost SEO? What topics will help further my goal? 5. Apply, submit, pitch Some websites require for you to first apply to be a contributor; others require an article-idea pitch or full-article submission. Even if websites allow you to send full articles, it might be a good idea to contact editors with article ideas first; editors might then be more inclined to accept your article, because it will be about a topic they've expressed an interested in. When you are writing your pitch, consider more than just the blogger or journalist on the other end, but the audience they want to serve. For the blogger, the most influential part of your message will be what you can do for the website's audience. After determining whether they have already published similar articles, include a few of your article ideas in the pitch. If they have published on the same topic, you may want to select a different topic or highlight the benefits of writing a similar article (update information, present a different angle, etc.). It's a good idea to include benefits for all your pitched article topics; mention how each would benefit the publication's audience. Give a taste of your previous work by including a selection of your published articles in either a range of topics that show your strength and versatility as a writer or ones relevant to the article ideas you are pitching. When possible, include articles from a range of sites, too, to show that you are a dedicated contributor in multiple spaces and an industry thought leader. (To learn more about pitching to bloggers, read my article "How to Save Time During Blogger Outreach: The Contact Stage." Guest-Posting Consistency Depending on the host website's preferences, you may even become a regular contributor. In such cases, strive to submit at least one guest post a month. Including your interest in becoming a regular contributor may even increase the perceived value of your pitch. Websites that only occasionally publish guest posts may want only one article from you, and so it's on you to follow up and pitch to the editor again if you want to submit more. According the Neil Patel in his "7 Lessons Learned from Publishing 300 Guest Posts," you don't want to guest-post too frequently on industry blogs; although doing so drives traffic and new readership, you will have diminishing returns, since large numbers of readers will already have come to know about your website. "The ideal frequency for posting on industry blogs is one to three times a month, assuming you are going after the largest blogs in your space," he suggests. Follow-Up Timeline After you have submitted or pitched your article, it can take several weeks for editors to review your article and enter it into the submission queue. If you haven't received a response within two weeks after submission, feel free to send a follow-up email, as the site may have lost or overlooked your message. I have seen articles published more than a month after submission, even though there was no response from the website indicating the article was accepted for publication. It's not ideal, but it happens; you have to learn how to work around it. To avoid that situation, do not submit the same article to a different publication until you receive a "no" from the initial publication you submitted to. 6. Write the article Follow the Blog's/Site's Format Format is important to bloggers. When writing your article, consider the format of other articles on the website, and reflect that format in your own post. As a best-practice, create a text hierarchy to organize your article and make it easier to scan. Rigorously follow contributor guidelines, especially length requirements, including citation from credible sources and photos, if requested. Write for the Audience, but Keep SEO in Mind Always put the audience first when writing articles. In addition to optimizing your copy for user experience, place relevant and popularly searched keywords in the article title and headers to increase organic traffic, boosting your chances of more guest posts. Ask a friend or colleague to review and edit your article. Having another perspective can improve the quality of your article messaging and accuracy. Make the Investment Last Plan on writing evergreen content that is not time-sensitive: Depending on the website's submission backlog, it could even months to see your article published (which is another reason it is a good idea to submit your article topics prior to a draft). Evergreen content will also help your post rank organically and drive more traffic over time. 7. Show appreciation by sharing on social Make it clear to the blogger or editor that you plan to share your article on your personal and professional social channels to show appreciation for the guest post opportunity by helping the website increase its reach. Tag the publication in your social posts to further develop your connection with it and possibly increase your social profile reach. 8. Analyze your traffic: Is guest-writing worth it? No matter what marketing tactic you use, measure it to evaluate performance. Based on your goal, determine whether your guest-posting efforts are worth it: How much referral traffic has your website received? Have you gained more traffic from social? Did your social following increase? Do visitors from these referral sites become return visitors? Have any of those visitors turned into leads or customers? If one website outperforms others, you may want to focus on regularly contributing to just that one site.

Especially valuable is the advice about considering the audience and working cooperatively with and accommodating blogger's/editor's contribution requirements. Honoring those, especially deadlines, is essential to success and being welcomed back. 'Suggest the whole strategy of developing and contributing informative content for media publication, AKA publicity, holds far more persuasive value than self-publishing material on a company's web site, corporate blog or as yet another white paper. Long-standing blogs and digital and/or print media outlets addressing target audiences have far more credibility and readership than your company's site ever will. The minor degree of lost control over content is more than made up for by the benefits mentioned above. Consistent submission of contributed content will drive SEO, lead generation and brand recognition/preference, particularly in situations where your competitors are not executing this strategy or doing it randomly and poorly. Also, having a team of authors developing a healthy barrage of content will bring results faster than one person attempting it. Strongly agree with planning contribution topics the organization is prepared to develop content about. "Write about what you know," is always the best idea. Demonstrating and sharing expertise, in nearly any sector, is powerful promotion. It doesn't have to be about your brand's products or services. "How to" and/or "why to use or be successful with what the company provides," is usually a sound basis for content development topics. Subscribe Today IT'S FREE!

According to a Reddit user, after greeting the device with “OK Google, good morning”, Google Home gave him the usual information about time and weather — and then added the following message: “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and the Beast opens today. In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” Other Reddit users confirmed hearing the same message, with none of them being pleased about it. Many who don’t currently own Google Home swore off buying it altogether after hearing about the ads. Not good for Google’s fledgling smart home device. No matter how you look at it, an unprompted conversation which is promotional in nature can hardly be interpreted as anything other than an ad. However, Google’s PR machine doesn’t want you to think so. A Google spokesperson stated the following: ”This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” Google’s PR spin didn’t go over well and the company has since removed audio ads from the device. Although that doesn’t mean they won’t return in the future as Google continues to “experiment”.

The British government has suspended its advertising on YouTube after some public sector ads appeared next to videos carrying homophobic and anti-semitic messages, prompting a flood of major companies to follow suit. Britain is the largest market for Alphabet Inc's Google outside the United States, generating $7.8 billion mainly from advertising in 2016, or nearly 9 percent of the U.S. giant's global revenue. "I would like to apologise to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content," Google EMEA President Matt Brittin said at the annual Advertising Week Europe event in London. Besides well-known British brands pulling the plug, some of the world's biggest advertising companies responsible for placing vast amounts of marketing material for clients, said they were reviewing how they worked with Google. The boycott is the latest clash between advertising companies and the internet giants that have built up dominant positions in digital advertising by offering not only huge audiences but also the ability to apply their user data to make ads more targeted and relevant. For big advertising groups such as WPP, internet firms are both a client and a competitor, while traditional media groups such as newspapers and general online news publishers are having to compete with them for online dollars. HOSTILE INDUSTRY "Google faces a hostile industry of media owners in Europe ... and we expect they will be all too happy to highlight future brand safety failings," said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group. "Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem," he said. WPP, the world's largest advertising firm, said on Monday it was talking to clients and media partners such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat to find ways to prevent brands from being tarnished. "We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company. They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements," said Martin Sorrell, the founder and head of the British firm. Publicis, the world's third largest advertising firm, said in a statement on Monday that it was clear Google had fallen short of meeting advertising standards and that the French company was reviewing its relationship with Google. Google said on Friday it worked hard to remove ads appearing on pages or videos with hate speech, gory or offensive content but with 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute it did not always get it right. Brittin said Google had made a commitment to doing better and would simplify advertiser controls, add safer defaults and increase investment to enforce its ad policies faster. A spokeswoman for Google UK said it would look again at the way it defines incendiary commentary and hate speech to raise the bar on videos and sites allowed for advertising. On Friday, Google executives were called in to face questions from the advertising industry and Britain over the issue. Representatives for retailers Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury's and Argos, British banks HSBC and RBS, McDonald's, the UK branch of advertising group Havas and the BBC told Reuters their firms had stopped ads. A source at Lloyds Banking said the lender had pulled the plug as well. Others such as Vodafone, Barclays and Tesco were reviewing policies, their representatives said.

By Michael Simon Staff Writer, Greenbot | Mar 20, 2017 7:34 AM PT Credit: Guess More like this TAG Heuer's Connected Modular 45 is the Android Wear 2.0 watch you want but... Everything we think we know about the LG-Google watches TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45: Hands on with the swankiest Wear watch of all Video Hands on: TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch While we haven’t seen too much in the way of must-have Android Wear 2.0 wearables from traditional tech companies like LG or Google, fashion watch makers are fully embracing Google’s new mobile OS. In the past week, Tag Heuer and Montblanc have both announced Android Wear 2.0-powered smartwatches, and now Guess is looking to get some skin in the game too. The company announced at Baselworld that it will be releasing a range of smartwatches powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 2100 chip, both under its own Guess moniker and the higher-end Gc brand. The new watches represent something of a reboot for the original Connect, which was released in late 2015 as a hybrid powered by Martian. Both offerings will come in two sizes tailored at larger and smaller wrists, in a range of materials. The Gc Connect is based on the Structura style, with 318L stainless steel cases in brushed and polished steel, and rose gold or bronze finishes. They will be available in a variety of styles and come with interchangeable bands, with the men’s version offering a ceramic bezel and a PVD or polished steel case, and ceramic, silicon, or leather straps. The ladies’ model features a rose gold top ring in silver, polished steel, or rose gold cases. Guess will also be releasing a consumer-branded Connect watch in 44mm and 41mm cases, with the ladies mode available in silver, gold, and rose gold, and adorned with clear crystals around the bezel. The men’s model is somewhat more traditional, with a “variety of dress and sport styles for the man who wants versatility in his watch accessory.” Decidedly aimed at the fashion market, neither the Gc nor Guess watches will feature LTE. Android Pay was not mentioned in Guess’s press release, and Android Wear 2.0’s fitness capabilities were only given a passing mention, so presumably they will skip NFC, GPS, and heart-rate sensors well. Pricing and availability hasn’t been announced, but Guess is targeting a fall/winter release. Watch this space: We’re still waiting for the first tech-savvy Android Wear 2.0 watch that we need to have, but it’s interesting to see so much activity from Swiss-branded watches. It was assumed that Apple had the luxury watch market locked up with its Apple Watch Edition, but with a mix of modern and traditional stylings, perhaps Android Wear could carve out its own niche among horologists.

CloudReady, for those unfamiliar, is essentially Chrome OS for old Windows laptops that aren’t capable of running Windows 10 or other versions of Windows smoothly anymore. These laptops, however, are able to run Chrome OS just fine as it’s a lot more lightweight than Windows. In the past, Neverware delivered Google’s services like Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets with CloudReady. Now, the company is teaming up with to deliver Microsoft’s Office 365 Education services instead. The company is replacing Google Drive with Microsoft’s OneDrive on CloudReady’s latest version. Similarly, the company is also replacing Google Docs with Microsoft Word, Google Sheets with Microsoft Excel and it’s also packing Microsoft OneNote now. CloudReady users will still be able to run Google services, but Microsoft’s services will now be present instead of Google services out of the box. CloudReady is aimed at schools looking to get affordable devices — the service is now available for $1 per student for one year, or schools can get it for $15 per device for one year. Additionally, schools can also get CloudReady for one device at $59 for a lifetime. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Reuters/Ruben Sprich If latest reports are to be believed, Google has recently delayed the release of its highly-anticipated Nexus 7 2017 tablet. The company is said to be improving on the features of the device. While some sources say that the Nexus 2017 tablet will run on the Andromeda operating system, certain others say that the Android 7.0 Nougat OS will be the one it will be running on. Earlier reports were saying that the two operating systems will be merged but that seems unlikely. However, having two operating systems in one device may confuse buyers. Google’s head of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer, said that Android and Chrome will never merge as that would not make sense at all. According to a December 2016 report by Chrome Unboxed, Hiroshi talked about trial and error methods to ascertain which operating system will fit the best. He further stated that “cross-pollination” is possible but not a merge. However, experts now believe that the Google Nexus 7 2017 tablet may finally go with the Android 7.0 Nougat OS. There are conflicting views as regards the specs and features of the Nexus 7 2017 tablet. The tablet is expected to have a 7-inch AMOLED display with 2,560 x 1,440 pixels screen resolution. The tablet is said to be powered by a 4GB RAM and have 64GB of internal storage. One reason why fans are eagerly waiting for the tablet is because Google had said earlier that it will be focusing a lot on both smartphones and tablets. This had led many to believe that the tablet is very much in the works. The search giant may not be producing Pixel laptops anymore. Fans are expecting at least a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, though rumours point towards a Snapdragon 820 chipset. Meanwhile, Samsung is said to be targeting business professionals via its Galaxy Book. It is a tablet that is said to be a direct replacement for a laptop. It runs on the Windows 10 OS. The keyboard and stylus are part of the bundle. The Super AMOLED screen is now the talking point of the device. The Samsung Galaxy Book has a display resolution of 2,160 x 1,440 pixels and 216ppi. The upgraded S Pen is battery-free and included in the box. There is a 4GB and 8GB RAM option and a seventh-generation Intel core i5 chipset. The tablet is available in standard wi-fi and wi-fi + LTE variants. USB Type-C ports have been included in the device.

Time to come out of hibernation; it's officially the first day of spring #GoogleDoodle pic.twitter.com/rX3GxvjlJS — Google UK (@GoogleUK) March 20, 2017 "Today is the spring equinox — when the day and night are equal in length. The word equinox comes from the Latin for equal and night. Almost everywhere in the world today, nighttime and daytime are each 12 hours," Google wrote on its blog. "We use the equinox to mark the change of seasons, as the balance of light shifts to make for longer days or nights ... You may also notice that on the equinox, the sun rises directly in the east and sets directly in the west, whereas at other times in the year, it appears off-center if you're facing those directions."

But a new leak suggests the company may go back to the premise of bigger is better. Multiple sources speaking to Droid Life appear to suggest a third handset will be launched alongside follow ups to the Pixel and Pixel XL. This third phone has been codenamed "taimen" which, to anyone aquatically-minded, means a big fish in the salmon family.

The aforementioned Nexus 6P was codenamed Shamu, after the famous whale. It doesn't take much to string the two together and plenty of gadget fans are predicting a "Pixel XXL" could make an appearance towards the end of 2017. Executives have already confirmed that new versions of the Pixel are coming and that the phones will remain premium - in an attempt to take on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.

Google's momentum as a must-buy stock may be slowing down, as U.K. companies begin to pull away from the advertising giant over concerns regarding where their ads are appearing. Pivotal Research Group downgraded Alphabet stock from buy to hold on Monday after media buying agency Havas pulled spending from YouTube and Google Display Network in the U.K. last week. Other reports indicated more companies including the U.K. Government, L'Oreal, RBS, HSBC, Sainsbury's, Sky, Marks & Spencer, McDonald's and Audi have also suggested they would pull ads from the Google-owned platforms over similar concerns, Pivotal said. Pivotal reduced its price target on Alphabet to $950 from $970. Google has the world's biggest digital advertising platforms. According to eMarketer, it will account for 40.7 percent of all U.S. digital advertising budgets in 2017, more than double Facebook's share. According to the Financial Times, Havas spends approximately $217 million on digital ads in the U.K. annually. It also told the publication it was mulling a complete freeze on all Google advertising. The brands are reacting to a The Times of London report stating several video ads from brands and charities including Mercedes-Benz, Waitrose and Marie Curie were seen running next to jihadist and neo-Nazi content, giving these groups advertiser money. Google's EMEA president of business and operations, Matt Brittin, apologized on Monday for the misplacement of advertising. "While Google has apologized for the incidents, and while the scale of the underlying problem may be relatively small in absolute terms, for large marketers, any one instance of an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm a brand's business value," Pivotal's Brian Wieser wrote in a report. Google addressed the concerns at Advertising Week Europe on Monday, saying the company would work on policies to find content advertisers deemed "safe," improve advertiser controls and work faster to remove content that violated its policies. However, Pivotal was unsure if that would be enough to assuage fears, because it minimized rather than solved the issue. "Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem," Wieser said. "This should curtail spending slightly from the large agency-serviced brands which probably account for a quarter of spending on Google."

View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit We’ve now heard more than one report that, while Apple has augmented reality plans for the iPhone, it is also planning to make some smart glasses further down the line. This is the product category made famous – or perhaps infamous – by Google Glass. There are two undeniable facts about Google Glass. First, it’s cool technology. Second, it’s decidedly uncool to be seen wearing them. It was that latter fact that led to Google abandoning plans to pitch them as a consumer device and to target them instead at enterprise applications, like giving engineers hands-free access to manuals while repairing equipment. Now, Apple is a master of taking once-geeky technology and making it cool. It did that with the iPod – turning a rather techy product category into the coolest product on the planet at the time – and of course with the iPhone. Previous smartphones were techy-looking things controlled by a keyboard and stylus, the iPhone was a friendly device that had mass-market appeal. But could even Apple make smart glasses cool … ? Anker braided Lightning cables Let’s start by getting one possibility out of the way. Google sees a market for smart glasses in the enterprise area, and I think it’s absolutely right. I can see a ton of applications in situations where getting the job done efficiently is more important than how you look while doing it. But Apple is a consumer company. It’s exceedingly unlikely it plans to make anything specifically for the enterprise sector. The closest it gets to that is the Mac Pro, and that isn’t really an enterprise product – it’s one made for the creative sector, which primarily comprises small businesses. And even there, Apple’s commitment to the product is distinctly underwhelming. So if Apple really does plan to make smart glasses, it will be doing so as a mass-market consumer product. Google tried to persuade us via marketing images that Glass was cool. Nobody fell for it. Real-life people wearing Glass looked like they belonged in a lab. But Apple could do better, right? It could take a clunky design and make it sleek and desirable, surely? Well, maybe, but I see two obstacles. First, when you actually look at Google Glass, it’s not that clunky a design. I mean, sure, that black plastic would look better clad in anodised aluminum, and it’s visually disturbing that the curve of the plastic doesn’t match the curve of the headband. It definitely needs some work. But even with Jony Ive’s touch, the basic form factor needs to be roughly the same. You need enough battery in there to power the display for a decent length of time, so you’re not going to lose much bulk. The display itself has to be mounted in roughly that position, so you’re not going to lose the cyborg look. You need the headband or some similar device to hold it in position. And so on. In short, it’s hard to see how any smart glasses could look massively different in appearance from this. Unless you disguise them as real glasses, but the massive variation in designs there shows the magnitude of the task of trying to make a handful of models that look good on anyone. Second, what job are smart glasses intended to do for consumers? It’s not going to be virtual reality – Tim Cook has already made that abundantly clear – so it’s not going to deliver an immersive gaming experience. The type of applications we’ve heard so far are all things that can be done perfectly well by a smartphone, holding it up in front of us for the short time needed to perform the specific task we need. So what is the application that justifies wearing something like this all day? I’m skeptical that Apple can give us a good reason to wear smart glasses, and I’m skeptical that even its highly talented designers can make them look stylish. But I do have one piece of counter-evidence to my thesis: AirPods. I don’t care what marketing images Apple has out there; real people do not look cool while wearing AirPods. (Sorry, Jason: I’m not picking on you – I’m using your photo precisely because you look exactly like everyone who isn’t a backlit model looks while wearing AirPods.) And yet AirPods have apparently been a massive commercial success. Supply is only now starting to catch up with demand. Which, in my view, can only be explained in one of three ways: People think they look cool wearing them They don’t care how they look, they love the portability & convenience The fact that it’s an Apple product makes it automatically cool to be seen wearing them Perhaps that third possibility is the answer here. If any other company had launched AirPods, everyone would be commenting on the weird design. But because it’s Apple, the brand lends a coolness to the product that the design really doesn’t deserve. Maybe Apple can pull off the same trick with smart glasses. What do you guys think? Will smart glasses always make you look like a cyborg no matter how slick the design? Can Apple actually make them look cool? Or is the Apple branding enough to turn an uncool look into a desirable one? As ever, please take our poll and share your thoughts in the comments.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Import and Export Contacts Between Outlook and Gmail You can use Microsoft Outlook with just about any email account, including Gmail—but Outlook doesn’t provide a built-in way to sync your Gmail contacts. If you’ve amassed a bunch of contacts in either service, you’ll have to import them from the other manually to use them. You could re-enter each contact one by one, of course, but we recommend importing all of your contacts in one go. In this article, we’ll demonstrate how to first export your contacts from Gmail into Outlook, and then export from Outlook into Gmail. How to Export Contacts from Gmail and Import Them into Outlook To export contacts from your Gmail account, open a browser and log in to your account. Then, click on “Gmail” and then select “Contacts” from the dropdown. Google is redesigning Contacts and you can try out the Contacts preview (click on “Try Contacts preview” in the menu on the left when viewing contacts in the old version). However, the Contacts preview does not allow you to export contacts yet, so we have to revert to the old version to export our contacts. To do that, click “Go to the old version” at the bottom of the list of options on the left. Once you’re back in the old version of Google Contacts, click “More” at the top of the page and select “Export” from the dropdown. Notice, you can export a group, selected contacts, or all your contacts into one of three formats. The export format should be an Outlook .CSV (CSV = Comma Separated Values, which means each field [Name, Address, Phone, etc.] is separated by a comma) file. Select the contacts you want to export, and then select the “Outlook CSV format” option. Click “Export” to start the export process. On the Save As dialog box, navigate to where you want to save your contacts CSV file. By default, contacts.csv is entered in the “File name” box as a suggestion for a name, but you can change that, if you want. Then, click the “Save” button. When the export is finished, you can open the exported .CSV file in Excel and manipulate itby adding addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and other information that will help round out your address book. While this is an optional step, it’s nice to be able to go through and make your contacts neat and consistent. When you’re ready, it’s time to import your shiny new contacts file into Outlook. Open Outlook and click the “File” tab. On the backstage screen, click “Open & Export” on the left and then click the “Import/Export” button. The Import and Export Wizard dialog box displays. Select “Import from another program or file” under Choose an action to perform and then click the “Next” button. Select “Comma Separated Values” and click the “Next” button. Now, we need to select the file to import, so click the “Browse” button. On the Browse dialog box, navigate to the folder where you saved the .csv file, select the file, and then click the “OK” button. Under Options, decide whether or not you want duplicates to be imported. You can save yourself time later by selecting “Do not import duplicate items” now. Click the “Next” button. Select “Contacts” in the Select destination folder box under the email account where you want to save your contacts. Then, click the “Next” button. The last screen on the Import a File dialog box shows you what’s about to happen (“Import ‘Contacts’ from folder: Contacts”) and offers you the opportunity to map any custom fields you might have created in Gmail Contacts. What does it mean to map custom fields? Simply, some of the fields in .csv file that came from Gmail might not match the destination address book you’re importing to, which means you’ll need to “map” them. As the dialog explains, you need to drag the value in the .csv file on the right, to the field in Outlook on the left that most closely resembles it. When you’re done mapping fields, click the “OK” button. Now, click the “Finish” button to complete the import process. You can see your imported contacts by opening the “People” icon at the bottom of the left pane. Your Gmail contacts are now available in Outlook. Now, you can go through and edit to your heart’s content, adding images, mailing addresses, secondary phone numbers, and any other bits of information you think are important and relevant. How to Export Contacts from Outlook and Import Them into Gmail If you have your contacts in Outlook and you want to transfer them into your Gmail account, open Outlook and click the “File” tab. On the backstage screen, click “Open & Export” on the left and then click the “Import/Export” button. The Import and Export Wizard dialog box displays. Select “Export to a file” under Choose an action to perform and then click the “Next” button. Select “Comma Separated Values” and click the “Next” button. Select “Contacts” in the Select folder to export from box under the email account in which your contacts are located. Then, click the “Next” button. Now, we need to choose a location and specify a name for the exported file, so click the “Browse” button. On the Browse dialog box, navigate to the folder where you want to save the .csv file. The default name of the file in the “File name” box is contacts.csv, but you can change this if you want. Click the “OK” button to select the file to import. Click the “Next” button to continue. The last screen on the Export to a File dialog box shows you what’s about to happen (“Export ‘Contacts’ from folder: Contacts”) and offers you the opportunity to map any custom fields you might have created in Outlook. What does it mean to map custom fields? Simply, some of the fields in your Outlook address book might not match the destination you’re importing to in .csv file, which means you’ll need to “map” them. As the dialog explains, drag the Outlook value from the list on the right, to the field in the .csv file on the left that most closely resembles it. Chances are you probably won’t need to mess with this, but it’s good to know in case you import your Outlook contacts and end up with mismatched fields. When you’re done mapping fields, click the “OK” button. Click the “Finish” button to complete the export process. When the export is finished, you can open the exported .csv file in Excel and manipulate it you like, adding addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and other information that will help round out your address book. While this is an optional step, it’s nice to be able to go through and make your contacts neat and consistent. When you’re ready to import your contacts into Gmail, open a browser and log in to your account. Then, click on “Gmail” and select “Contacts” from the dropdown. Google is redesigning Contacts and you can try out the Contacts preview (click on “Try Contacts preview” in the menu on the left when viewing contacts in the old version). However, the Contacts preview does not allow you to import contacts yet, so we have to revert to the old version to import our contacts. To do that, click “Go to the old version” at the bottom of the list of options on the left. On the Contacts screen, click the “More” button and select “Import” from the dropdown. Click the “Choose File” button on the Import contacts dialog box. On the Open dialog box, navigate to the folder where you saved the .csv file from Outlook, select the file, and then click the “Open” button. Click the “Import” button on the Import contacts dialog box to finish importing the contacts from the .csv file. Your newly imported contacts won’t be merged into your main contacts list—at least not in Gmail—instead, they’ll get their own group. NOTE: If you don’t see your contacts listed yet, refresh the web page. If you click on the group of imported contacts, you’ll be able to merge them and delete duplicates. It might take a little time to clean them all up, but if things are a total mess, then you can always remove your imported contacts, return to Outlook, and perform the process again, this time either using the map fields function or Excel to fix the problems. You now have an address book full of contacts that you can immediately start emailing. That said, this is a one-time deal, meaning that when you start making changes to the contacts in one email client or service, the other client or service won’t reflect the changes.

(Seeking Alpha) Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was slapped with a rare downgrade on Monday as Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser lowered his rating on the stock to Hold from Buy with a price target lowered to $950 from a previous $970 due to ongoing concerns in the United Kingdom. According to U.K.-based Daily Mail, several notable local brands, including retail giant Marks & Spencer, are no longer going to advertise on Google's YouTube platform. Companies have concerns that their brand image is being shown alongside content from extremist channels and groups, including neo-Nazi and even jihadist groups. Global Repercussions According to Wieser, Alphabet's Google unit faces brand safety issues in the United Kingdom, but this can have global repercussions. The analyst expanded that ad quality and brand safety represent the biggest issues facing the advertising agency. In addition, advertisers are effectively putting money in the pockets of terror and extremist groups. Google has since apologized and pledged to fix the problem by improving controls it gives advertisers and working faster to remove hateful content. However, Wieser argued that the approach isn't enough to remedy concerns. "The approach comes across to us as attempting to minimize the problem rather than eliminating it, which is the standard we think that many large brand advertisers expect," the analyst argued. "We think that Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero tolerance policy, to alleviate concerns before it can fully recover." Bottom Line The analyst also suggested that U.K. marketers could expand their local boycott of advertising on Google's platform to other global markets which prompted the analyst to lower his full-year revenue estimate for Alphabet by one percent point. In addition, Wieser noted that Alphabet's recent run up now puts the stock well within the 15 percent band he uses to justify a Buy rating.

Ron Amadeo - Mar 20, 2017 2:49 pm UTC reader comments 75 Share this story Park the car, press the blue dot, and save your current position. Swipe the card up and add photos, notes, and a timer or change the location. You'll get a notification about your parking spot. If you hate this feature, you can turn it off. Google Maps quietly added a sweet new feature that will help you remember where you parked. Just park your car, open up Google Maps, and tap on the blue location dot. You'll be presented with a new menu offering to "save your parking," which lets you store all the information you need to find your car again. The new interface will save your current location and slap a big "P" icon on the map. This wouldn't be enough for a multistory parking garage, though, so you can bring up a new interface that lets you save a ton of information. You can adjust the dot location, add photos to your parking spot, and type notes. If there's a parking meter, you can even set a "time left" field that will count down the time remaining. After filling out this info, Google Maps will spawn a notification reminding you that you have a saved parking location. The notification and the "P" icon on Google Maps will stick around until you open the parking information and hit "clear " or until you save a different parking spot. This new "parking saving" feature is a lot better than Google's last attempt, which existed in Google Now. Now would try to automatically guess when you parked via Android's "activity recognition system" (it looked at the GPS and marked down where you hit 0 mph). It kind of worked, but it required way too much trust in Google's magical algorithms for something as critical as a parking reminder. Purely GPS-based parking saving was also useless in those big parking garages, where GPS doesn't work and won't tell you what level you are on. This new proactive version lets you store all that extra info and gives you the peace of mind knowing that the information will actually be there when you get back. For now, the new feature seems to be working only on Android Google Maps v9.49. There are almost no feature differences between the iOS and Android versions of Google Maps, though, so we'd imagine it will hit iOS once the new version successfully navigates the app store's update process.

A digital marketing CEO’s prescription to cure advertising fraud As the threat of ad fraud continues to loom over digital marketers, columnist James Green lays out the ingredients we need to promote transparency and drive the industry forward. James Green on March 20, 2017 at 10:27 am More Challenges around viewability, media metrics and transparency in the advertising inventory supply chain have festered for more than a decade, and they’ve recently hit a fever pitch. We see marketers increasingly demanding accountability for their digital media spends and looking for transparent and standard metrics to support digital advertising effectiveness. They’re fed up with ad fraud and waste in the supply chain — and so am I. A wake-up call was issued by Procter & Gamble’s chief brand officer in late January at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s Annual Leadership meeting. Marc Pritchard, marketing leader of the world’s biggest advertiser, lambasted the digital ad industry for creating poor experiences for consumers, and highlighted media and tech giants Facebook and Google for lack of transparency on the performance of campaigns on their platforms, along with uneven inventory quality. Pritchard asserted that he doesn’t “want to waste time and money on a crappy media supply chain” and urged the industry to fix issues his company has been demanding for over a year. Undeterred, at an Association of National Advertiser meeting in February, he took up the issue again. When a behemoth like P&G talks, its impact as a change agent isn’t likely to be ignored. Most recently, Pritchard said Facebook and Google’s agreement to submit to audits by the Media Rating Council is not enough, and that agencies must offer more transparency around audit results. My reaction to Pritchard’s charges? Good for him — and for us. The more we all rally around change in a complicated and fast-moving industry, the better. Here’s another smoldering issue: Brand marketers’ ads are increasingly being served up on inflammatory media websites like Breitbart News. There is a striking lack of, or ineffectiveness of, safeguards for brands that need to know where their ads are running. Marketers want their ads running in “brand-safe” and contextually relevant environments, but when buying ads on open exchanges, there are no guarantees where the ads will run. According to a New York Times article, investment advisory firm Vanguard was clued into its ads showing up on Breitbart, not by its advertising agency but by a client. Not exactly the kind of call Vanguard was hoping for. As CEO of a company with a marketing platform for ad, email and site personalization, I’ve had a front-row seat to these issues as they’ve unfolded in our industry. I’ve also experienced endless “the buck stops with me” moments while trying to face head-on the challenges of this complex industry. So, here’s my “prescription” to move us forward: Ingredient One: What’s our version of the Lemon Law? If you’ve ever bought a car and encountered persistent problems caused by the manufacturer, you’re likely familiar with a law on the books in the US called the “Lemon Law.” This legislation is intended as a remedy for purchasers who, by no fault of their own, purchased a defective product. I am not proposing a Lemon Law per se, but a way to legitimately address a brand’s concern over paying for a “defective” advertising campaign (i.e., you shouldn’t pay for an ad that isn’t seen). Instead, the advertising industry hides behind the “contractual clause” excuse or complicated jargony explanations Pritchard rails against. Specifically, sellers of media need to be responsible for the ads they sell, and that should trickle down from the top to the bottom of the value chain. Thus, if I sell an inappropriate ad impression to an agency or brand, they shouldn’t pay for it. But if I bought that impression from an ad exchange, then I shouldn’t pay for that impression. And then, of course, the ad exchange shouldn’t pay the original seller. That is not how it works today. If I buy an ad, and an agency says it’s not viewable, I don’t get the revenue, and I still pay for the purchase, which means the seller still makes money. When the seller is selling fraud, that’s just not right, and it encourages more bad behavior. Ingredient Two: Be our own change agents and agree to universal standards When I look at what’s happening around the world and here in the US as people vie for change, I see action, not talk. Grassroots initiatives are popping up everywhere to push for change. In politics, we see people putting a stake in the ground defining non-negotiable issues. More people are preparing to run for local or state elected office having never served before. Indeed, we have a president who was elected at least in part because millions of people felt forgotten and wanted a revolution rather than more of the same. I’m hoping that we’ll see similar enthusiasm in our industry. We should be the ones to drive change, not be driven by it. This needs to start with agreeing to viewability standards, rather than opining on why they won’t work. P&G is adopting the MRC standard. It may not be perfect, but it’s a start. Our industry has evolved dramatically over decades — and so can our standards, so long as we define them. Ingredient Three: Consensus-driven industry guidelines and individual ethics We need consensus-driven industry guidelines and must adhere to an “honor code” of sorts to responsibly regulate ourselves within the industry. Every person, no matter what function or title, can live up to this honor code. What stops one from making an unethical choice? Generally, it’s our individual moral compass. For example, our company sees and uses data on the way people behave and engage, but we made the decision not to collect data on medical status or history, or any personally identifiable financial information. It’s reasonable to think there are companies that could utilize this data, but we don’t believe it is ethically appropriate. This is in line with IAB guidelines. I am reminded of the Charles Dickens novel, “A Tale of Two Cities,” and its most famous line, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” It was, of course, the age of wisdom and “the best of times,” and yet at the same time it was the age of foolishness, “the worst of times.” We are lucky to be in an industry that reaps the benefits of imagination and rigor of data science. As an industry, we have come so far and have many great advancements ahead of us. We need a cure that encompasses industry-wide reform, or future foolishness will win out.

 Samsung says you'll be able to control the Galaxy S8 with just your voice Steve Kovach Mar. 20, 2017, 10:34 AM 5,951 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Samsung Galaxy S7. Flickr/Kārlis Dambrāns Samsung thinks phones are too hard to use. The answer? A digital assistant that lets you do everything with voice commands instead of poking, swiping, and tapping at your phone. It's a bold, unproven promise that Samsung says it's bringing to its next smartphone, the Galaxy S8. The new assistant is called Bixby, a sequel of sorts to S Voice, the voice-control app Samsung launched years ago but has since hidden on recent devices. In a blog post announcing Bixby, Samsung says the assistant will debut on still-unannounced Galaxy S8 and activate with a dedicated button. (It's also a little strange Samsung is pre-announcing a major feature of the Galaxy S8 over a week before it formally unveils the phone.) Samsung promises Bixby will let you control everything on your phone and Bixby-powered apps with your voice. In theory, talking to your device and telling it what you want will take away the need to learn how a new phone works. Samsung also says Bixby will be better at understanding natural language than rival digital assistants, so you won't have to memorize certain commands. The principle behind Bixby appears to be that phones have grown too complicated to use, therefore you need a more natural way to interact with the technology. It's the same concept being explored on screen-free devices like Amazon's Echo and Google Home, but hasn't really found its way to phones and computers yet. While you can control your iPhone with Siri and some Android phones with Google Assistant, it's still more natural to tap on the screen the old-fashioned way. Of course, it'll be impossible to judge how well Bixby works until we see the Galaxy S8 in person on March 29. The move also threatens to confuse users even more, now that all Android phones are getting Google's own Google Assistant. Plus, manufacturers like Motorola and Huawei are starting to build Amazon's Alexa assistant into some of their devices. So that's the real head-scratcher here. Instead of relying on Google's expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence, Samsung is going rogue with its own digital assistant. Bixby also sounds like it'll be extremely limited at first and will only work with some of Samsung's apps that come with the Galaxy S8. It's not a replacement for search or other information like Alexa or Google Assistant. Bixby appears to only let you control your phone, although more capabilities could be added in the future, thanks to Samsung's recent acquisition of the AI startup Viv. Eventually, Samsung plans to allow third-party app developers to enable Bixby in their apps, which will be tough for the company to do at scale. Historically, it's been hard to get developers to enable features in apps specific to just one device. For example, very few apps added features for Samsung's curved "edge" screens and Apple is still struggling to get developers to adopt the 3D Touch pressure-sensitive screen on newer iPhone models. Good luck convincing developers to enable Bixby commands if they only work on one phone. Samsung also says it plans to expand Bixby to all of its connected devices, from smart washing machines to connected TVs, a clear play against Alexa, which is already popping up in a variety of connected devices like robot vacuums and even Ford cars.  SEE ALSO: Google says the voice ads on Google Home aren't really ads NOW WATCH: Here's everything we know so far about Samsung's new Galaxy S8 Loading video...
